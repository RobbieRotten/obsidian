Executive Power\n\nThe executive power of the Commonwealth is vested in the Queen and is exercisable by the Governor-General as the Queen’s representative and extends to the execution and maintenance of this Constitution and of the laws of the Commonwealth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRights Guaranteed in the Constitution\n\nEven if there is a head of power that allows the Commonwealth to pass the law on that topic, there may be other express and implied provisions within the Constitution that limit the COmmonwealth’s legislative power.\n\n\nLegislative Powers of the States\n\nThe states can pass laws about any topic they wish provided there is no express or implied imitation in the Constitution, and the law is not inconsistent with a valid Commonwealth Law\n\nS 109 of the Constitution - State laws inconsistent phrases nullified by Federal\n\n\n\n\nCommonwealth Executive Power\n\nMost significant powers of the Executive are conferred by legislation\nOther powers derive directly from the Constitution (eg the Gov-Gen power as Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces)\nWhile still, others come from common law\n\nPrerogative powers\n\n\nAccording to the principles of responsible gov, the Gov-general exercises nearly all powers only on the advice of the Executive (PM and/or other ministers)\n\n\nJudicial Power of the Commonwealth: Chapter III\n\nJudicial power is the power to resolve disputes by the application of law\nIt is exercised by the HC and the FC, and some state courts,\n\n\n\n\nConstitutional Power in Summary\n\nIn Australia, our Constitution ensures that we have\n\nA division of powers between the States and the CW -

Ors v the Commonwelath (Seas and Submerged Lands case) (1975)\n\n\nMust there be a “sufficient connection” (or “nexus”) between the law and Austrlaia?\n\nPolyhukhovich v Cth (War Crimes case)\nHORTA V THE COMMONWEALTH (1994)\n\nAustralia negotiated and signed a treaty with Indonesia, regulating the petroleum rich sea bed between Australia and East Timor (now Timor-Leste)\nThe plaintiffs in Horta, claimed that the treaty was illegal – void – in international law and that the Commonwealth could not rely on the external affairs power to legislate to give effect to the treaty.\n“Regardless of whether the mere fact that a matter or thing is territorially outside Australia is of itself sufficient to bring a matter or thing within the phrase “External affairs” for the purposes of s. 51(xxix) or whether one or other of those additional factors is necessary, it is clear that the area of the Timor Gap and the exploration for, and the exploitation of, petroleum resources within that area all fall within that phrase.”\n\n\nVictoria v Cth\nXYZ v Cth\n\n\n\n\nINTERNATIONAL RELATIONS\n\nRelations with other countries\n\nR v.

(ie does the subject of the treaty need to be international in nature?)\n\n\n\n\nConformity: How closely do the provisions of the law have to conform to the wording of the treaty? (the “conformity principle”)\n\n\n\n\nR v Burgess\n\nSubject matter: Restricted to ‘matters of sufficient international significance’ (Starke J) or ‘indisputably international in character’ (Dixon J)?\nThe Conformity principle: The legislation must conform to the treaty… but how closely? (In Burgess the regulations under the Act were invalid because they did not follow the text closely enough)\nMeticulous adherence to the terms of the treaty is not required, so long as the purpose of the treaty is effected\n\nR v Poole; Ex parte Henry (No 2) (1939) 61 CLR 634\n\n\n\n\nConclusion on treaties\n\nTreaty is not limited to any particular subject matter\nMust embody precise obligations not just vague aspirations\nTo be a law with respect to this aspect of ‘external affairs’, the law must be reasonably capable of being considered appropriate and adapted to implementing the treaty\nCommonwealth v Tasmania (1983) 158 CLR 1\nVictoria v Commonwealth (1996) 187 CLR 416\n\n\n\n\nLIMITATIONS ON THE EXTERNAL AFFAIRS POWER\n\nWhat are the limits on the scope of the external affairs power?\n\nSection 51(xxix) is ‘subject to’ the Constitution and its express and implied constitutional limitations\n\nVictoria v Commonwealth (1996) 187 CLR 416\n\n\nIf the Commonwealth exercises its external affairs power to implement treaty obligations which are void or unlawful under international law, will this invalidate the domestic legislation?\n\nHorta v The Commonwealth (1994) 181 CLR 183\n\n\n\n\nThe Commonwealth may not cite an international obligation as a ‘sham or circuitous device to attract legislative power’\n\nKoowarta v Bjelke-Petersen (1982) 153 CLR 168\nR v Burgess; Ex parte Henry (1936) 55 CLR 608 at 642, 658, 669 and 687.\nHorta v The Commonwealth (1994) 181 CLR 183\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 5: Corporations Power\n\n\nThe Corporations Power s51(XX)\n\ns. 51 (xx):\n\nThe Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to:\r\nforeign corporations, and trading or \tfinancial corporations formed within \tthe limits of the Commonwealth\n\n\nWhat is a corporation?\n\nIn general terms a corporation is a legal entity that can operate very like an individual in that it can enter contracts, take out loans and borrow money.

Rocla Concrete Pipes\n\nS51(xx) allows the Cth to make laws with respect to restrictive trade practices of corporations which affect, inter alia, the sale and distribution of goods.\nThis case represents the beginning of the opening up of the corps power\nThe cases that have followed have made it clear that the corporations power may affect activities beyond those directly related to trade and finance.\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT IS A TRADING OR FINANCIAL CORPORATION?\n\nTrading Corps\n\nR v Judges of the Federal Court of Australia; Ex parte Western Australian National Football League (Adamson’s case) (1979) 143 CLR 190\n\nLeague corporations were trading corporations because they were engaged in “substantial trading activities”, “not insubstantial trading activities” and trading activities of “sufficiently significant proportions”\nAlso trading had its popular meaning and was more than just buying and selling but also included business activities.\nDo not look to the original purposes of the corporation look at its actual activities\n\n\n\n\nCourt revisits what is a trading corporation\n\nCommonwealth v Tasmania (1983) (Tasmanian Dams Case)\n\nWas it a corp?\n\nMason and majority: Hydroelectricity Commission of Tasmania was a corporation\n\nFact that it sold electricity made it so\nThis was despite the fact that it also conducted public undertakings\n\n\nGibbs and minority: it was not a corp because it was a public body with a public purpose\nThis case in line with Adamson firmed up the view that the test was the “current activities test”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional cases\n\nCommunications, Electrical, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied services Union v Queensland Rail (2015)\n\nHere the QLD parliament attempted to put QLD Rail Transit Authority beyond CW Corporations power by providing in s6(2) QLD Rail Transit Authority Act that it was “not a body corporate”\nHigh Court found it was a trading corp and held that a State parliament can’t simply legislate to remove a corp from Commonwealth power if Constitutionally it would otherwise be within power.\n\n\n\n\nFinancial Corporations\n\nState Superannuation Board v Trade Practices Commission (1982)\n\nMust be a substantial and not insignificant part of its established operations however they do not have to be the predominant activities\nTest is the same for financial and trading corps\nCorp can be both financial and trading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReady Made Companies\n\nInactive Corporations – an exception\n\nFencott v Muller (1983)\n\nAppropriate to look at the purposes in this case where the company was a shelf company and had never traded or engaged in financial activities.\nA shelf company is one that has never traded and hold no assets or liabilities. Basically it sits on the shelf unused until it is needed at which point it is ready to go.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT ACTIVITIES OF A CORPORATION CAN BE REGULATED\n\nActivities: includes protection of trading\n\nActors and Announcers Equity Association v Fontana Films Pty Ltd (1982) 150 CLR 169\n\nActors Equity persuaded theatrical agents not to supply actors to Fontana Films who were refusing to exclusively employ union members.\nHeld: Power extended to both the regulation and protection of the trading activities of trading corps ie included secondary boycotts\nObiter:\n\nMason (supported by Aiken) not confined to trading and financial activities\nMurphy includes corps not yet formed and industrial relations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTasmanian Dams Case 1983\n\nWhat activities were covered?\n\nHaving decided that the HEC was a Constitutional Corp the next question was which of its activities could the Commonwealth regulate?\nThe HEC was prohibited under the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act section 10(2) from felling trees or excavating and using explosives without the consent of the Commonwealth.\nWere these non trading activities covered?\nMason, Murphy and Deane all said that they these activities were covered taking the wide view that the activities could include those activities that supported the trading activities.\n\n\nGibbs, Wilson and Dawson held to the narrow view that only trading activities were within power.\nBrennan did not decide either way as he felt on the facts it was only necessary to consider the validity of section 10(4) which he found valid on the basis that the Commonwealth could regulate acts done by Constitutional corporations if they fell within the implied incidental power.\nThus the decision re 10(2) was 3:3 but Brennan’s inclusion of incidental matters made the scope wider\nTas Dams is therefore seen as precedent for a middle view that:\n\nThe Commonwealth can regulate trading activities and activities conducted for the purposes of trade\n\n\n\n\nRe Dingjan; Ex Parte Wagner (1995)\n\nsection 127c(1)(b) Industrial Relations Act which extended the power to review contracts to cases “in relation to a contract relating to the business of a Constitutional Corporation.” ie independent contractors\n4:3 found the provision invalid however by 5:1 they endorsed a wider view of activities than previously but still required a nexus\nDawson was in favour of a narrow view\nGaudron endorsed a wide no nexus view.\n\n\nInvalid despite the wide view\n\nThe specific provision was invalid because the law was attempting to regulate independent contractors and\nPer McHugh: therefore it was not a law with respect to a corporation.\nPer Brennan and Toohey: therefore there was an insufficient nexus between the corporation and what the legislation sought to regulate ie independent contractors\n\n\nGaudron’s dissent (became the majority view in Workchoices 2006)\n\nGaudron held that the s51(xx) power extends at the very least to business functions and activities.\nIt is sufficient that a law be “expressed to operate on or by reference” to the corporation.\nDo not need “significant” or “substantial” connection\n\n\nGaudron J\n\n“When s51(xx) is approached on the basis that it is to be construed according to its terms and not by reference to unnecessary implications and limitations, it is clear that, at the very least, a law which is expressed to operate on or by reference to the business functions, activities or relationships of constitutional corporations is a law with respect to those corporations.”\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WORK CHOICES CASE\n\n\nNew South Wales v Commonwealth (WorkChoices Case) (2006) 231 ALR 1\n\nActivities are anything connected to a Corp\nThe case concerned the use of the Corporations Power to regulate industrial relations. The challengers argued:\n\nThe Corporations Power only permitted the regulation of ‘external’ relationships, not ‘internal’ relationships and the relationship between a constitutional corporation and its employees was ‘internal’. \nA law was not within the Corporations Power merely because it confers rights and imposes obligations on constitutional corporations. \n5:2 Decision –adopted dissenting reasoning of Gaudron J in Re Dingjan and her later decision in Re Pacific Coal Pty Ltd: Ex parte the CMEU (2000)\nThe majority decision: Gleeson CJ and Gummow, Hayne, Heydon and Crennan JJ.\n\nA law regulating the ‘activities, functions, relationships and business’ of a constitutional corporation or creating rights, privileges or obligations of a constitutional corporation was within the Corporations Power.\n\n\nThe minority\r\nKirby and Callinan JJ.\n\nThe federal balance had to be maintained. Consequently, the Corporations Power was subject to the Industrial Disputes Power.\nEither the Corporations Power could not be used to regulate industrial relations or was subject to the same limitations as the Industrial Disputes Power (ie. being limited to making laws about conciliation and arbitration of interstate industrial disputes).\nThis meant the entire WorkChoices Act was invalid – although only part relied on the Corporations Power.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWork Choices changed Industrial relations for ever more\n\nThe majority upheld the Work Choices legislation on the basis that the object of the legislation was the Constitutional Corporation\nIn addition, provisions not directed toward the Corporation may still be viewed as valid if they fell within the incidental power.\n\n\n\nImplied Incidental Power\n\nAttached to every express grant of power is an implied grant of power wide enough to make the express grant effective\nD’Emden v. Pedder 1904 Included in the larger grant of power is “Every power and every control the denial of which would render the grant ineffective”\nSee also Brennan in Tas Dams Slide 24\nWhere the validity of a law depends on bringing it within the incidental power it will usually be necessary to examine the purpose of the law and ask is it appropriate and adapted to the purpose\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 6: Separation of Power\n\n\nCh III ss 71-77: courts of the federal jurisdiction\n\nCh III, s71:\n\nestablishes the High Court of Australia;\nallows Cth Parliament to establish federal courts (now done);

Consider:\n\nIs the function closely connected to Executive or Legislative functions?\nIs the PD’s function to be performed independently of any instruction, advice or wish of the executive or legislature?\nIs there any decision-making discretion for the PD which will be exercised on political grounds? (You may look at the procedural fairness, inter alia, but existence of procedural fairness is not conclusive of compatibility.)\n\n\nAlso:\n\nIs having a judge do this function a long-standing practice in Australia?\nIs this more or less problematic than the telephone warrants scheme? (It breached Separation of JP Rules but was allowed, creating PD exception.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeparation of Judicial Power at Federal and State Level\n\nKable Principle: state-level separate of JP\n\nNSW has no entrenched doctrine of the separation of powers. (Nor do the other states.)\nThe implication is that state laws can violate the separate of judicial power without offending the NSW Constitution.\nBUT even state laws must comply with the Constitution of Australia, including its entrenched separation of judicial power.\nKable v DPP (NSW) (1996) is the key case explaining why.\n\n\nKable v DPP (NSW) (1996) 189 CLR 51\n\nFacts:\n\nCommunity Protection Act 1994 (NSW) empowered the NSW Supreme Court to order the detention of a person, for up to 6 months.\nUnusually, s 3 limited the application of the Act to one person, Gregory Wayne Kable, who had been convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 5 years’ imprisonment. Upon expiry of his sentence, the NSW Supreme Court ordered his continued detention for a further 6 months.\n\n\nDecision:\n\nBy 4:2 majority, the High Court held that the Act was invalid by virtue of infringing the separation of judicial power under Ch III of the Commonwealth Constitution. (Legislation invalid, NSW Court order set aside.)\n\n\n\n\nSTATE Legislation - Updating our Rules on Separation of JP\n\nRule 1.\n\nThe judicial power of the Commonwealth cannot be vested in any tribunal other than a Ch III court: Wheat case (1915), Boilermakers Case (1956).\n\n\nRule 2.\n\nA Ch III court which is the HCA or a federal court cannot be invested with anything other than Cth judicial power, i.e. not non-judicial power; not State judicial power: Re Wakim (1999), building on Boilermakers (1956).\n\n\nAND a Ch III court which is a state court vested with federal jurisdiction (namely a state supreme court) cannot be vested with non-judicial powers which are incompatible with its exercise of federal judicial power: Kable (1996)\n\n\n\ni.e. state legislation attempting such vesting is unconstitutional.\n\n\n\n\nBut state judicial power can be vested (by state legislation) in any non-judicial state body, eg NCAT.\n\nThus, neither the Parliament of NSW nor the Parliament of the Commonwealth can invest functions in the Supreme Court of NSW that are incompatible with the exercise of federal judicial power’\n\n\n\n\nWhy does the Constitution of Australia apply as a limit on the legislative power of state parliaments?\n\npublic confidence cannot be maintained in a judicial system which is not predicated on equal justice, the proceedings under s 5(1) [of the NSW Act] are unique in applying unique rules and procedures only to the appellant [Mr Kable] – in so doing, the Act makes a mockery of judicial process and inevitably weakens public confidence in it, and therefore also in the institutions which comprise the judicial system brought into existence by Ch III (per Gaudron J at 107).\n\n\nApplication of the Kable principle\n\nThe HCA then applied the Kable Principle to review laws from the Qld and NSW Parliaments, but found that those Acts did not create incompatibility with the exercise of federal judicial power:\n\nFardon v Attorney-General (Qld) (2004) [a Qld Act];\nBaker v The Queen (2004) [a NSW Act];\nCondon v Pompano Pty Ltd (2013) [a Qld Act].\n\ni.e. those Acts were valid.\n\n\n\n\nFardon: HCA held that a QLD Act about preventative detention was valid, distinguishing facts from those in Kable: textbook p234. Revision: How?\nBaker: HCA held that a NSW Act about minimum pre-parole time was valid, distinguishing facts from those in Kable. Revision: How?\nHowever, in International Finance Trust Company Ltd v New South Wales Crime Commission (2009) and South Australia v Totani (2010), the NSW Act and SA Act under review offended the Kable principle and were therefore ruled invalid by the HCA.\n\n\nApplication of the Kable principle\n\nKable Principle: the separation of judicial power under Ch III of the Cth Constitution applies to state courts, an “integrated system”.\n\nInternational Finance Trust Company Ltd v NSW Crime Commission (2009)\n\n\nHCA held that a NSW Act about ex parte orders about property was invalid based on the Kable principle.\n\n[This section of the Act] “engages the Supreme Court in activity which is repugnant in a fundamental degree to the judicial process as understood and conducted throughout Australia”: Gummow and Bell JJ.\n\n\nCondon v Pompano P/L (2013): Unanimous HCA held QLD Act valid.\nWhat was different about the facts in this case compared to International Finance Trust Co v NSW Crime Commission?\n\nUnder the Qld Act, the state supreme court “retain[ed] its decisional independence and the powers necessary to mitigate the extent of the unfairness”: French CJ at 79-80.\nIf “a novel procedure is said to deny procedural fairness, attention must be directed to questions of fairness and impartiality” to determine whether that procedure is constitutionally valid: Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ at 103.\nBut “the appearance […] of that institutional integrity will not endure if there is manifest unfairness in the procedure of the court”: Gageler J at 115.\n\n\nSouth Australia v Totani (2010)\n\nHCA held that a SA Act was invalid based on the Kable principle.\nHow did this law with respect to control orders impair the institutional integrity of the Court(s)?\nState SC judges have no discretion with these control orders: this Act is “obliging the Magistrates Court to act upon the declaration by the executive [i.e. The A-G], […] subject only to the satisfaction of the Magistrates Court that the defendant is a member of the declared organisation” […] and thereby to act in a fashion incompatible with the proper discharge of its federal judicial responsibilities and with institutional integrity” Gummow J at 66-67.\nThis statute “gives the neutral colour of a judicial decision to […] the result of executive action”: French CJ at 52.\n\n\nShift from ‘public confidence’ to ‘institutional integrity’ as key to compatibility\n\nE.g. Momcilovic v the Queen (2011):\n\nVictorian Human Rights Charter (an Act) about Supreme Court issuing Declarations of Inconsistent Interpretation conferred a non-judicial power on that court, yet the HCA held it was valid.\nFrench CJ and Bell J:\n\ntest is incompatibility with “institutional integrity of the Court” (like Kable): this Act is compatible, it maintains distinct roles for court and parliament.\n\n\nGummow J, Hayne J concurring: this is incompatible with institutional integrity and therefore invalid.\n\n\nCrennan and Kiefel JJ: issuing such declarations is incidental to exercise of judicial power. An equivalent Cth Act assigning the HCA or a federal court this function would not breach Rule 2 (it’s Exception 1).\n\n\n\n\nState laws must maintain these ‘institutional integrity’ characteristics of State courts\n\nThe reality and appearance of decisional independence and impartiality.\nThe application of procedural fairness.\nAdherence as a general rule to the open court principle (noting that there are a number of situations in which closed court, ex parte hearings and reliance on confidential information are permissible).\nThe provision of reasons for the courts’ decisions.\nThe capacity to review a decision on the basis of jurisdictional error.\nJudicial process. (PTO)\n\n\nJudicial process as part of institutional integrity\n\nThe Kable Principle means that State and Territory courts invested with federal jurisdiction must achieve justice via a ‘judicial process’.\nIn addition, Gaudron J said in Polyukhovich (1991): “An essential feature of judicial power is that it be exercised in accordance with judicial process.”\nElements of judicial process:\n\npower can only be exercised when the decision-making body is called upon to take action (i.e. not initiated by the court itself);\nthe adjudication must proceed by an open and public inquiry (with some exceptions);\nthe rules of natural justice must apply;\nthe judge(s) must ascertain the law as it is and the facts as they are and then apply that law to the facts.\n\n\n\n\nPersona Designata exception, now at State level\n\nWainohu v NSW (2011)\n\nCrimes (Criminal Organisations Control) Act 2009 (NSW) sets up “an eligible judge”, if they consent, as a designated person to make declarations against criminal organisations. Not bound to follow rules of evidence or to provide reasons. No automatic legal consequences. = A non-judicial function.\nThis seems to breach Boilermakers Rule 2 as extended to States by Kable.\nLegal question: Does the Persona Designata exception exist at State level and cover this arrangement?\nHCA’s Answer: Yes, the PD exception exists at state level, but it does not cover this partiuclar incompatible arrangement. Act therefore invalid after all (6:1).\n\n\n• This is a “merger between the Grollo v Palmer principle limiting the activities of federal judges as designated persons, and the Kable doctrine limiting the functions of state courts”: Heydon J at 248, in dissent, but an accurate description. (Wilson and Kable were handed down 3 days apart.)\n\n\nWainohu v NSW (2011) extends the persona designata exception to State judges.\n\nSo you need to check:\n\n\n\nDoes the person (a State judge) consent to the additional appointment created by this state legislation?\n\n\n\n\nIs the appointment created by this state legislation compatible with their ongoing exercise of judicial power?\n\n\n\n\nI.e.\n\n-PD’s function(s) is not closely connected to (State) Legislature or (State) Executive;\n-PD’s function(s) is independent of instruction, advice or wishes; and\n-PD’s function(s) is not exercising political discretion to make a decision.\n\n\n\n\nRemember, these questions are applied to legislation made by a State parliament to see if it is valid or invalid according to the Constitution of Australia\nSeperation of powers Cheat sheet\n\n\n\n\nWeek 7: Alien Power\n\nIntentional ambiguity as to meaning of alien/‘people of the Commonwealth’\n\nAmbiguous feeling about who Australians were and whether Australians were differentiated from the British\n‘We know who we are’ — desire to carve out a polity with certain racial characteristics without being explicit\nThe aliens power\n\n51.The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to: -\n(xix.) Naturalisation and aliens.\n\n\nParliament has power to make laws with respect to aliens\n\nCan parliament regulate the entry and removal of anyone defined as a non-citizen?\nIn other words, is an alien just anyone who is a non-citizen?\n\n\nWho is an alien?\n\nShort answer:\n\nParliament’s power to make citizenship laws (and revoke citizenship) is underpinned by the aliens power.\nThe HC has appeared to settle on the definition of an alien as a person who does not owe or have allegiance to Australia.\nPrior to Love, the HC appeared to assume this was always the case for a non-citizen of Australia.\n\n\nIs the Migration Act valid enacted under the aliens power?\n\nMigration Act 1958 (Cth), section 4\n\n\nThe term ‘alien’ does not appear in the Migration Act\nAre the legislative categories of citizen/non-citizen basically equivalent to the constitutional categories of subject and alien?\n\n\nPochi v Macphee (1982) 151 CLR 101\n\nOne of the first modern cases on the aliens power\nPochi challenged his deportation on the basis the aliens power didn’t apply to him because although he was a non-citizen, he was absorbed into the Australian community and owed allegiance to the Australian Crown.\n\nCited Blackstone to say that an alien is someone who is not allied with the King.\n\n\nHigh Court held:\n\nan alien is someone allied to a foreign power or not allied to the Australian Crown. Pochi, as an Italian citizen, was an alien.\n\n\nGibbs CJ famously said :\n\n‘Parliament cannot, simply by giving its own definition of “alien”, expand the power under s 51(xix) to include persons who could not possibly answer the description of “aliens” in the ordinary understanding of the word’, but that it could ‘treat as an alien any person who was born outside Australia, whose parents were not Australians, and who has not been naturalized as an Australian’ (at 109-110).\n\n\n\n\nNolan, Taylor and Shaw\n\nPlaintiffs all emigrated from the UK as children before 1975.\nThey were British citizens, not Australian citizens.\nIn all three cases, the Minister for Immigration ordered their deportation or removal back to Britain on the grounds of their substantial criminal records.\nThey argued that, at least until 19871 British citizens were a special class of persons who were non-citizens in Australia but also not alien under the constitution, and so couldn’t be the object of legislation underthe aliens power in s 51(19).\n\n\n\nBrief outline of some changes to nationality and citizenship for British subjects\n\nNolan v Minister for Immigration (1988) 165 CLR 178\n\nParliament can legislate wrt aliens and an alien is anyone other than an Australian citizen under the legislation\nWhere the Constitution referred to ‘subjects of the Queen these references should now be taken to mean subjects of the Queen of Australia, not the Queen of England.\nGaudron dissent:\n\nAlienage is a constitutional term; it can’t just be equated with a concept that comes from legislation\nAn alien is someone who is not a member of the community, the body politic of the nation state.\n\n\n\n\nRe Patterson; ex parte Taylor (2001) 207 CLR 391\n\nSplintered decision.\n\nMajority seems to follow Gaudron J’s dissent.\n\n\nThe category of alien under the constitution is complicated by Australia’s origins as a colony of Britain.\nBritish subjects are seen to have a special status under the constitution and in certain circumstances can’t be treated as aliens.\n\n\nShaw v Minister for Immigration (2003) 218 CLR 28\n\nThe majority (Gleeson C Jl Gummow, Hayne, Heydon JJ) went back to the view in Nolan.\nAliens power allows parliament to legislative wrt non-citizens.\nUpshot: Alien = non-citizen.\n\n\nSo where does this view of the aliens power come from?\n\nMajority in Shaw:\n\nAt Federation, British subjects were not considered aliens underthe constitution.\nBut the constitutional meaning of aliens had changed\n\nthe constitutional relationship between Australian and the\ncitizenship legislation\n\n\nNow there is no separate category of ‘non-citizen British subject’ (who is not an alien).\nThere is now no category of ‘non-citizen non-alien’.\n\n\nGleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ held in Shaw that pursuant to the aliens power Parliament could define those persons who would be categorised as aliens: at [2].\nBut, Parliament’s power to define those who were aliens was not ‘at large’: at [9].\n\n\nSingh v Commonwealth (2004) 222 CLR 322\n\nCommon law principle of jus soli: birthright citizenship\nCitizenship Act amended in 1986 to deny citizenship to children born in Australia to parents who are not Australian citizens or permanent residents\nTania Singh born in Australia to failed asylum seekers and facing removal\nMajority held:\n\nAlthough at federation ‘alien’ would not have encompassed someone born in Australia, the constitutional definition of alien is not governed by common law of alienage including ‘jus soli’\n\n\nThroughout history, an alien is a person who owes allegiance to a foreign state\n\nSingh was an alien and her removal was valid under aliens power\n\n\n\n\nKoroitamana v Cth (2006) 227 CLR 31\n\nAffirmed Singh even though Koroitamana girls were not citizens of Fiji\nBirth in Australia doesn’t preclude someone from being subject to the aliens power\nAliens power gives Parliament the capacity to decide to who will admitted to citizenship\nForeign allegiance is relevant (as was the case with Tania Singh) but not required to designate someone as an alien\n\n\nChetcuti v Commonwealth of Australia [2021] HCA 25\n\nChetcuti asserted he was in a small class of people who were British subjects and arrived in Australia before citizenship was introduced in 1949.\n\nMajority in Shaw had held:\n\n‘the aliens power has reached all those persons who entered this country after the commencement of the Nationality and Citizenship Act 1948 (Cth) on 26 January 1949 and who were born out of Australia of parents who were not Australian citizens and who had not been naturalised’ (at [32]).\n\n\nHC held:\n\nChetcuti was an alien, and could be deported under the Migration Act.\n\n\nPlurality (Kiefel CJ, Gageler, Keane and Gleeson JJ):\n\nBy 1948 Australia’s independence from the British Empire had progressed to the point where it was open to parliament, through the aliens power, to legislate citizenship.\nChetcuti didn’t seek citizenship at this or any later point through naturalisation.\nSo he was an alien and could be deported.\n\n\nGordon and Edelman JJ:\n\nEmphasised that statutory concepts cannot determine constitutional membership.\n\nSo it was not the case that, when the Citizenship Act came into effect in 1949 that everyone who wasn’t a citizen suddenly was an alien.\nChetcuti wasn’t an alien at that time.\n\n\nNevertheless, by 2017 Chetcuti became an alien: he was a non-citizen, born outside Australia, had no Australian parents and had never taken out citizenship.\n\n\nSteward J (dissent):\n\nCalled the judgment in Shaw a ‘necessary and convenient constitutional fiction’ [134].\nSince Chetcuti arrived before the Citizenship Act was introduced, he was not an alien then and he had not subsequently become an alien.\nAlienage relates to lack of allegiance to the Australian Crow\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASF17 v Commonwealth of Australia\n\nMatter currently before the High Court\nWhether indefinite detention is permissible where no real prospect of removal because the detainee is not willing to cooperate with authorities to achieve the removal\nFederal Court has ruled detention in these circumstances constitutional — there is a “lawful purpose … as long as there is a practicable way that the person may be removed, even if it requires cooperation from the detainee\n\n\nMigration Amendment (Bridging Visa Conditions) Act 2023 (Cth)\n\nThe Minister must impose 28 mandatory conditions on people who were released because of the decision, regardless of their individual circumstances, unless “the Minister is satisfied that the holder does not pose a risk to the community”\nIncludes reporting rules, curfews, requirement to wear ankle bracelets and seek approval before person can take certain jobs\nBreach of conditions is a criminal offence carrying a mandatory minimum sentence of one year’s imprisonment\nHigh Court challenges:\n\nWhether the executive government, rather than a court, can impose these restrictions on a person’s liberty\nWhether such restrictions are for legitimate protective purposes if applied “across the board” with little or no consideration of the risk an individual may pose to the community\nWhether imposing mandatory restrictions on a person’s liberty, without considering their appropriateness to each individual, amounts to punishment\n\n\n\n\nMigration Amendment (Removal and Other Measures) Bill 2024\n\nSeems to attempt to pre-empt the High Court’s ruling in ASF17\nWould allow the Minister to direct a person who is subject to removal from Australia to complete, sign and submit a document (eg a passport application or another document to facilitate travel)\nWould be a criminal offence to fail to comply with this direction, punishable by 5 years’ imprisonment\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 8 - Inconsistency of Laws (s 109)\n\ns109, Inconsistency of laws\n\nWhen a law of a State is

Commonwealth (1971)(Pay Roll Tax Case )\n\nThe Cth Payroll Tax Act 1942 prescribed a 2.5% payroll tax on all employers – not just government employers.\nThe State of Victoria challenged the Cth tax using the second limb from the Melb Corp doctrine – impairment or curtailment of a State’s right to function as a government.\nThe question of impairment is one of degree.\nThe tax had not prevented the States from discharging their functions for the previous thirty years.\nPay Roll Tax Case – no state immunity from the Commonwealth prerogative power of taxation.\n\n\nQueensland Electricity Commission v. Commonwealth (1985) 159 CLR 192 (QEC Case)\n\nThe QLD Bjelke-Petersen Government triggered an industrial crisis that threatened its electricity supply.\nThe Cth passed ss6(1) &amp; (2) of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, permitting the Tribunal (the CAC) to resolve industrial disputes between the State of QLD and trade unions in the present and into the future\nThe QLD challenged the Cth legislation on the basis of Melb Corp discrimination.\nGibbs CJ, Mason, Wilson and Dawson JJ found ss6(1) and (2) of the Cth Act wholly invalid.\n\nDeane and Brennan JJ, found it partially invalid.\n\n\nMason J (the Majority concurring) said: A Commonwealth Act cannot impose a special disability or burden on one or more States unless the federal power under which the legislation was made from its terms or nature contemplated such a law.\nBoth direct and indirect discrimination are prohibited: Mason J; Deane J (the same types of discrimination prohibited in Melb Corp);\nMason J held that the Cth had discriminated against QLD in both ways here.\n\nHe discussed, ‘singling-out’ (direct discrimination) AND the application of Cth laws to ‘disputes to which employers in that State are parties, those employers being for the most part authorities brought into existence by the State to carry out public functions, and then subjecting those disputes to a regime of differential treatment’ (indirect discrimination).\n\n\nDeane and Brennan JJ\n\nDeane and Brennan JJ were in partial dissent.\n\nThey upheld the validity of s6(1) of the Cth Act (dispute resolution in the present).\nBut struck down s6(2) (future dispute resolution).\n\n\nDeane and Brennan JJ invoked Dixon J’s exception (‘rational discrimination’ - textbook).\n\nThey found that s6(1) was ‘intended to authorize the discretionary operation of the particular law’ (Deane J) and was ‘calculated to provide for particular circumstances’ (Brennan J).\n\n\nSee also, Mason CJ and Brennan J, in Richardson v Forestry Commission (1988) 164 CLR 261.\n\n\nTwo sub points re discrimination: per Mason J\n\n(a) The principle operates to prohibit discrimination against a particular State as well as against States generally\n(b) the principle protects legislatures as well as executive governments as well as agencies that represent State governments and agencies created by statute and controlled by the State government.\n\n\n\n\nRe Australian Education Union; Ex parte Victoria (1995) 184 CLR 188 (AEU Case)\n\nThe Victorian Government abolished its state Industrial Relations tribunal.\nVictoria then attempted to sack a large number of school teachers and healthcare workers employed by the Victorian Government.\nThe teacher’s union (and others) brought proceedings against Victoria to negotiate redundancy packages in the Cth Industrial Relations tribunal under the Industrial Relations Act 1988 (Cth).\nThe tribunal made an interim award extending redundancy rights to Victorian public sector workers.\nEssentially, s111(1A) of the IR Act (Cth) said that the Cth tribunal (Australian Industrial Relations Comission (AIRC)) must hear a dispute when it cannot be dealt by a State tribunal.\nVictoria complained to the High Court on the basis of Melb Corp discrimination, seeking that the tribunal discontinue proceedings.\nMajority Decision (per Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ)\n\nSection 111(1A) did not ‘discriminate’ against Victoria.\nThis was due to the rational or ‘logical’ ‘purpose … substance and actual operation’ of the law which provides for ‘compulsory arbitration’ when no ‘alternative system of compulsory arbitration is available’ (rational discrimination); Majority (at 239-40).\nBUT, the second limb of Melb Corp - mere impairment or curtailment of a State’s capacity to function as a government – was enlivened: Majority per Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ (at 232-233).\nThe Cth will impair or curtail a State’s function as a government where it attempts to govern the employment of particular groups of public servants and their pay and conditions\n\n\nAdvice to the AIRC\n\nThe following were State industrial matters (with which the Cth tribunal could not interfere):\n\nnumbers of staff; duration of employment and redundancy; employment ‘at the higher levels of government’ including that of ‘Ministers, ministerial assistants and advisers, heads of departments and high level statutory office holders, parliamentary officers and judges’ (at 233).\n\n\nThe following were Cth industrial matters, over which the tribunal could exercise Cth jurisdiction:\n\nminimum wages and working conditions, set out in Cth industrial awards. [232-233].\n\n\nAccordingly, the federal tribunal’s interim award, preventing termination on the basis of redundancy, was held to curtail the ability of the state of Victoria to function.\n\nIt was quashed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAustin v Cth (2003) 215 CLR 185\n\nConcerned federal tax on superannuation benefits of State judicial officers.\n5:1 the court held that in its application to judicial officers of the States the legislation fell within the invalidity set out in Melbourne Corps. Kirby dissented.\nGaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ formulated a new test of State immunity, locating the two-pronged discrimination and curtailment test from Melb Corp and QEC within a broader unitary test.\nThe new test (Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ:\n\nTest: is there ‘a sufficiently significant impairment of the exercise by the State of its freedom to select the manner and method for discharge of its constitutional functions respecting the remuneration of the judges of the courts of the states’? (at 264).\n\nAnswer: yes\n\n\nGleeson CJ and Kirby J agreed with the new unitary approach\nMcHugh J continued to categorise state immunity as ‘discrimination’ under the first limb of Melb Corp - ‘singling-out’ judges (direct discrimination)\nKirby J (dissenting):\n\nthe tax did not have ‘a significant and detrimental effect on the power of the State to determine the terms and conditions affecting the remuneration of judges’ (at 290).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNSW &amp; Ors v Cth [2006] HCA 52 (The Workchoices Case)\n\nThe Cth introduced legislation that effectively stripped State industrial tribunals of around 90% of their matters, to be channelled to Cth industrial tribunals and heard under new highly politicised Cth industrial laws.\nStates argued that Cth legislation would impair the capacity of the State Industrial Relations Commissions to function (as per Austin).\nThe majority found that IRCs were ‘not so vital to the functioning of the State that it can be said … that it affects the capacity of the State to …function…‘.\nKirby and Callinan JJ dissented. Callinan hinted that the majority approach was an abuse of the Constitution. For Kirby, the federal balance issue mattered less than the traditional Australian approach to industrial relations.\n\n\nIndicia of state immunity (Clarke v Cmr of Taxation [2009] HCA 33 per French CJ at [34]):\n\n\n\nWhether the law in question singles out one or more of the States and imposes a special burden or disability on them which is not imposed on persons generally.\n\n\n\n\nWhether the operation of a law of general application imposes a particular burden or disability on the States.\n\n\n\n\nThe effect of the law upon the capacity of the States to exercise their constitutional powers.\n\n\n\n\nThe effect of the law upon the exercise of their functions by the States.\n\n\n\n\nThe nature of the capacity of the functions affected.\n\n\n\n\nThe subject matter of the law affecting the State or States and in particular the extent to which the constitutional head of power under which the law is made authorises its discriminatory application.\n\n\nDiscrimination will be more indicative of state immunity than other factors.\n\n\nTo Summarise:\n\nPre-1920 - intergovernmental Immunities apply\nEngineers (1920) - excludes intergovernmental immunities\nMelbourne Corp (1947) – intergov. immunities reintroduced through the concept of Cth discrimination against States (3 x types of discrimination: direct; indirect; and rational)\n\nz\n\n\nPayroll Tax Case (1971) - No Melb.

It refused, citing the lease and Cigamatic as evidence of Cth supremacy over State laws.\nSection 64 of the Judiciary Act did not apply due to this being a Tribunal proceeding, rather than a Court.\n\n\nThe Majority decisions\n\nMajority 6:1: The Cth was bound by the NSW Residential Tenancy Law\nBrennan CJ and a plurality of Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ distinguished between a State law restricting or targeting the Cth’s executive capacities and a State law of general application restricting the Cth in the exercise of those capacities (as per Dixon CJ in Cigamatic).\n\nThe first type is invalid due to the Cigamatic doctrine.\nThe second type is valid and binds the Cth.\n\n\nThe DHA’s capacities were prescribed by statute (not prerogative). The act of entering into a contract – the lease - was the Cth merely exercising its capacities.\n\nIn this sense, the State law was merely incidental. The Cth merely ran into a State law of general application while exercising its capacities.\nThe State law did not expressly target the Cth’s executive capacities.

there must be an acquisition whereby the Commonwealth or another acquires an interest in property, however slight”: Mason J [145-146], Murphy and Brennan JJ agreeing that there was no acquisition.\n\nDeprivation def\n\nlegislation adversely affects or terminates a pre-existing right\n\n\n\n\n“mere extinguishment or deprivation of rights in relation to property does not involve acquisition”: Deane J [283] (although he finds acquisition here of the benefit of restrictive covenant).\nNo such acquisition in ICM Agriculture v Cth (2009), nor in JT International v Cth (2012) re intellectual property.\n\n\n\nIs there an acquisition of property by/for the Cth not merely a deprivation?\n\n[…] What is important in the present context is that neither the Commonwealth nor anyone else acquires by virtue of the legislation a proprietary interest of any kind in the property.” Mason J [145-146], Murphy and Brennan JJ agreeing.\ni.e. they’re finding no transfer even of effective control (contra Deane J).\nSee also that an acquisition of property was found in Newcrest Mining (WA) Ltd v Cth (1997).\n\nThe control of land for conservation was factually similar to that in Tasmanian Dams, a National Park, but moreover the Cth, as the prerogative owner of the minerals, now no longer had to license them to miners = proprietary benefit.\n\n\nCompare the less prominent strand of jurisprudence accepting the acquisition of an interest of any kind (not a proprietary interest), e.g.:\n\nKirby J, Smith v ANL Ltd (2000), [527] (acquisition of a common law chose in action): “It is sufficient that the beneficiary gains ‘some identifiable measurable countervailing benefit or advantage’”.\na benefit of substantial control: Deane J in Tasmanian Dams;\nBank Nationalisation Case – gaining substantive proprietary benefit but not formal, legal proprietary interest.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs there an acquisition by/for the Cth (Cont’d)\n\nSometimes, ‘is there property that can be acquired?’ is considered a “compound conception” (Dixon J, Grace Bros (1946); recent cases)\ni.e. is there acquirable property?\nRule of thumb: “Where the asserted ‘property’ has no existence apart from statute further analysis is imperative” because it may not be acquirable property: Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ in A-G for NT v Chaffey (2007) [664].\n\ne.g. statutory choses in action.\n\n\nBank Nationalisation case:\n\nAcquisition of property in substance is what matters, in this case the legislation transferred “effective control” although not the legal property title over the bank. Read p440.\n\n\nNo acquisition of a statutory chose in action, although it is a kind of property, in HIC v Peverill (1994): “Rights of that kind are rights which, as a general rule, are inherently susceptible of variation […] the mere fact that a particular [statutory] variation involves a reduction in entitlement and is retrospective does not convert it into an acquisition of property”, Mason CJ, Deane &amp; Gaudron JJ [237]\n\n\n\n1&amp;2. Is there property and an acquisition by/for the Cth?\n\nChoses in Action = a right enforceable in court.\nThis is a kind of property, but is it a kind of acquirable property?\nGeorgiadis v Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation [Telecom] (1994) 179 CLR 297\n\nMr Geogiadis was a Telecom employee injured at work. He had a common law right to sue Telecom for damages.\nA new Cth Act extinguished this right.\nAll judges agreed this right was property.\n4:3 Majority agreed it was acquirable property, and in fact had been acquired, not on just terms i.e. the Act was invalid.\n\n\nA common law chose in action is acquirable property.\n\n\n\n1&amp;2. Is there property and an acquisition by/for the Cth (Cont’d)\n\nA statutory Choses in Action is another kind of property, but is it acquirable property?\nHealth Insurance Commission v Peverill (1994) 179 CLR 226\n\nDr Peverill could make claims to HIC for pathology test costs. While he and HIC were disputing the amount owed for each test, amended Cth Law retrospectively confirmed that the tests were only worth $4.60ea.\nHis statutory right to a previous, higher rate of repayment was thereby extinguished.\nSix judges agreed this right was property but this 6:1 Majority determined it was not acquirable property, and in fact had not been acquired, i.e. the Act was valid.\n(Similarly, a statutory entitlement to a specific (higher) rate of parliamentary retirement allowance is not acquirable property: Cunningham v Cth (2016).)\n\n\nCompare Peverill to Cth v WMC Resources Ltd (1998), with its nuanced dissent from Kirby J, textbook p449.\n\nIn AG(NT) v Chaffey (2007), majority agree that some rights created by Cth statutes are acquirable property, if they’re not inherently variable.\nThe rights in question were, however, too variable to be aquired.\nIn Wurridjal v Cth (2009), majority did not dismiss the claim for being about the acquisition of the benefit of Cth statutory (land) rights.\nIn JT International: Cth did not acquire intellectual (or other) property, but the IP was acquirable property even though it was created by Cth statute.\n⇒ Most statutory choses in action are not acquirable property but other forms of property created by statute are acquirable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the acquisition on just terms - A just amount?\n\n\nMarket value of the property lost is the starting point, balanced against community interests:\n\nNelungaloo P/L v Cth (1948), see Dixon J, textbook p457.\n\n\nPlus e.g. lost future profits:\n\nDalziel (1944);\nJohnston Fear v Cth (1943).\n\n\nPlus e.g. special or sentimental value of property - question posed, not answered:\n\nWurridjal v Cth (2009).\n\n\nLess than market value when market value is unfair, e.g. because market value is artificially inflated:\n\nNelungaloo.\n\n\n⇒ moving to full compensation = just,\n\ne.g. Gleeson CJ in Georgiadis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the acquisition on just terms - A just process?\n\n\nWurridjal v Cth (2009) 237 CLR 309\n\nLegislation passed by Cth Parliament as part of the Northern Territory Intervention converted property that had been granted to the Land Trust in fee simple under the Aboriginal Land Rights (NT) Act 1976 into a five-year statutory lease to the Commonwealth.\nThese leases also abolished a permit system under which the Land Trust and Aboriginal owners could refuse access to the property.\nThe majority found these measures to constitute an acquisition of property rights.\nThere was property, and acquisition, but it was ON JUST TERMS because the Act obliged ‘a reasonable amount of compensation’ be provided if acquisition occurred, even though enforcing this compensation would require starting court proceedings.\nAs such, the Cth legislation was not breaching this express right (i.e. not invalid).\nDissent, Kirby J: The property (rights) acquired may be more extensive and therefore whether just terms have been provided needs further consideration.\n\n\n\n\n\ns 51(xxxi): Exceptions\n\nWhen acquisition of property under Cth law does not require compensation on just terms:\n\nConfiscation or forfeiture of property re criminal offences.\nLiens enforcing payment for services.\nLaws relying on legislative heads of power which “clearly encompass the making of laws providing for the acquisition of property unaccompanied by any quid pro quo of just terms”, joint judgement, Nintendo v Centronic (1994) [160], eg:\n\nCopyright - s51(xviii), as in the facts of the Nintendo case;\nTax - s51(ii);\nSequestration of a bankrupt person’s property - s51(xvii).\n\n\nif you agree with Cth for acquisition on less than just terms: John Cook (1924).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ns 80 Trial by jury\n\nThe trial on indictment of any offence against any law of the Commonwealth shall be by jury, and every such trial shall be held in the State where the offence was committed, and if the offence was not committed within any State the trial shall be held at such place or places as the Parliament prescribes.\n\n\n\nSection 80\n\n“Section 80 is not a great guarantee of trial by jury for serious matters.”:\n\nMcHugh J, Cheng, Cheng and Chan v The Queen (2000).\n\n\nSection 80 is “a mere procedural provision”:\n\nBarwick CJ, Spratt v Hermes (1965).\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen does s 80 apply?\n\nNot for contempt of court proceedings: Majority, Re Colina (1999).\nNot for indictable or summary (criminal) offences in State laws.\nNot for summary (criminal) offences in Cth laws:\n\nwhether an offence in a Cth law is indictable or summary is up to Cth Parliament to state in legislation:\n\nR v Archdall and Roskruge (1928);\nMajority, Kingswell v The Queen (1985);\n\n\nand sometimes a Cth law lets the prosecutor choose.\n\n\nNot relevant to sentencing:\n\nCheung v The Queen (2001).\n\n\nSo, s80 is only for indictable Commonwealth offences.\nAnd not for Cth indictable offences in the Territories:\n\nBernasconi (1915)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen s 80 does apply, its requirements are:\n\nIn prosecutions of Cth indicatable offences, trial by jury is mandatory (cannot opt out):\n\nBrown (1986);\nAlqudsi (2016).\n\n\ns 80 implies a unanimous jury verdict (of the jurors remaining at the time of the verdict):\n\nCheatle v The Queen (1993);\nR v Glynn (2002).\n\n\nA jury that starts with 12 people and reduces is still valid but reducing to less than 10 people may not comply with s 80 because it may not achieve the purpose of a jury representative of the community:\n\nBrownlee v The Queen (2001), obiter.\n\n\nA jury can start with more than 12, too, e.g. 15 in R v Ng (2003).\nRandomly and impartially selected jurors who are non-lawyers and impartial to the dispute (Kirby J in R v Ng at [19]).\n\n\n\ns 116 (‘freedom of religion’) Cth not to legislate in respect of religion\n\nThe Commonwealth shall not make any law for\n\n[1.] establishing any religion, or\n[2.] for imposing any religious observance, or\n[3.] for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion, and\n[4.] no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth.

Murphy J dissented, and read the anti- establishment clause as prohibiting any Commonwealth sponsorship of or support for any religion\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 11: Implied Freedom of Political Communication\n\nImplied Freedom of Political Communication\nFour key takeaways from this lecture\n\n1:\n\nThe implied freedom of political communication is derived from ss 7, 24, 64 and 128 to protect communication on political or government matters.\n\n\n2:\n\nThis implied freedom creates a constitutional limit on the power of the Commonwealth and states to legislate, and on the common law, and can invalidate laws in certain circumstances.\n\n\n3:\n\nTo assess whether a law infringes the implied freedom of political communication, apply a modified version of the two stage test that was first adopted in Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation.\n\n\n4: McCloy Test\n\nStage 1 involves an assessment of whether the law effectively burden the freedom in its terms, operation or effect and\nStage 2 involves an assessment of whether the purpose of the law and the means adopted to achieve that purpose legitimate, in the sense that they are compatible with the maintenance of the constitutionally prescribed system of representative government,\nStage 3 involves an assessment of whethe the law reasonably appropriate and adapted to advance that legitimate object? (suitable, necessary and adequate in its balance), which was modified in McCloy v NSW in 2015, involves an assessment of proportionality\n\n\n\n\nDiscovering implied freedoms\n\nOver a number of years different judges and legal scholars explored the idea that there may be implied rights that exist within our constitutional framework\nBut if they do exist, how and when can the court discern them?\nWhat is the appropriate standard, and what can the implied right actually do?\nTwo early cases show the recognition of the implied freedom of political communication but also the difficulties with them, as the court struggles to achieve consensus\n\n\nAustralian Capital Television v Commonwealth (1992) 177 CLR 106\n\nAmendments to the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942 (Cth) sought to regulate the broadcast of political advertisements on electronic media during federal, State and local government election periods, including by prohibiting paid advertisements and instead mandating free advertising time for political parties already represented in the relevant legislature.\n\nIt was challenged, inter alia, for impeding freedom of political communication.\n\n\nThe court unanimously held that the Constitution protected freedom of political communication, with a majority of 5:2 finding that the legislation unjustifiably infringed that protection.\nAccording to Mason CJ (in majority):\n\nThe representatives who are members of Parliament and Ministers of State are not only chosen by the people but exercise their legislative and executive powers as representatives of the people; thus they are accountable to the people for what they do and have the responsibility to take account of the views of the people.\nIndispensable to that accountability and responsibility is freedom of communication, at least in relation to public affairs and political discussion.\n\n\n\n\nNationwide News v Wills (1992) 177 CLR 1\n\nThe Industrial Relations Act 1988 (Cth) created an offence of bringing the Industrial Relations Commission or one of its members into disrepute.\n\nA newspaper’s publisher was prosecuted as a result of a columnist referring to the Commissioners as a ‘corrupt and compliant judiciary in the Soviet style arbitration commission’.\n\n\nThe court unanimously held that the provision was invalid.\n\nMason CJ, McHugh and Dawson JJ held that the provisions fell outside of the scope of the conciliation and arbitration power in s 51(xxxv).\n\n\nBrennan, Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ held that they were within the scope of the head of power but breached an implied freedom of political communication.\n\nThis implied freedom derived from the fact that the text and structure of the Constitution established a system of representative government, which incorporates by implication the degree of freedom of communication necessary to sustain that system.\n\n\n‘The people of the Commonwealth would be unable to responsibly discharge and exercise the powers of government control which the Constitution reserves to them if each person was an island, unable to communicate with any other person…The ability to cast a fully informed vote in an election of the members of Parliament depends upon the ability to acquire information about the background, qualifications and policies of the candidates for election and about the countless number of other circumstances and considerations, both factual and theoretical…’ – Deane and Toohey JJ.\n\n\nMore cases emerged - but there was a problem with consistency…\n\nTheophanous v Herald &amp; Weekly Times Ltd (1994) 182 CLR 104\n\nTheophanous, a Federal MP, sued the Herald &amp; Weekly Times for defamation over a letter it published which included an allegation of his being biased towards Greeks while acting as a Chair of a committee on immigration.\nThe newspaper argued that the letter was protected by the implied freedom of political communication, as a defence to a common law action in defamation.\n\n\nDuring this case there were concerns expressed about the 1992 judgments and how the implied freedom was recognised as we as the scope of it.\n\nFor instance, McHugh J expressed concern that the freedom could be implied through ss 7 and 24 alone.\nA majority (Mason CJ, Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ) held that the freedom applied to the common law of defamation.\nThey considered that to hold publishers liable for all false allegations about members of parliament would lead to a reluctance to publish any allegation for fear of defamation suits.\nThis is frequently referred to as the ‘chilling effect’.\n\n\nStephens v West Australian Newspapers Ltd (1994) 182 CLR 211\n\nThis was another defamation case arising from allegations in a newspaper that certain members of the legislative council had taken overseas ‘junkets’.\nMason CJ, Toohey and Gaudron JJ held that the freedom of communication implied in the Commonwealth Constitution extended to public discussion of the performance, conduct and fitness for office of members of a State legislature.\nIt was further held that the implied freedom bound the state legislature, but it is unclear as to whether that was because of an implication arising from the State constitution of WA or the implication arising from the Commonwealth constitution.\n\n\n\n\nConsensus is finally reached on the implied freedom\n\nLange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1997) 189 CLR 520\n\nLange, a former Prime Minister of New Zealand, sued the ABC for defamation following a Four Corners program which he claimed suggested that his government had improper dealings with big business in exchange for political donations.\n\nThe ABC attempted to rely on the implied freedom of political communication in its defence.\n\n\nConcerns were expressed about the previous decisions by some of the justices of the court.\n\nThe Court re-evaluated its previous decisions and, in a unanimous judgement, tried to put the implied freedom on a more certain theoretical foundation, with an emphasis on the text of the Constitution:\n\n\n§ 7 and 24 and the related sections of the Constitution [e.g. s 128] necessarily protect that freedom of communication between the people concerning political or government matters which enables the people to exercise a free and informed choice as electors.\n§‘Freedom of communication on matters of government and politics is an indispensable incident of that system of representative government which the Constitution creates by directing that the members of the House of Representatives and the Senate shall “be directly chose by the people” of the Commonwealth and the States, respectively.’\n\n\n\n\nWhat sections of the constitution are the freedom derived from?\n\nSections 7 and 24 of the Constitution, read in context, require the members of the Senate and the House of Representatives to be directly chosen at periodic elections by the people of the States and of the Commonwealth respectively.\nThis requirement embraces all that is necessary to effectuate[28] the free election of representatives at periodic elections.\nWhat is involved in the people directly choosing their representatives at periodic elections, however, can be understood only by reference to the system of representative and responsible government to which ss 7 and 24 and other sections of the Constitution give effect[29].\n\n\nThe test initially derived by the court in Lange\n\nTwo stage test developed for determining whether a law infringed the implied freedom of political communications.\n\n\n\nDoes the impugned law effectively burden freedom of communication about government or political matters either in its terms, operation or effect?\n\n\n\n\n[If a burden is found] Is the law reasonably appropriate and adopted to serve a legitimate end the fulfilment of which is compatible with the maintenance of the constitutionally prescribed system of representative and responsible government and the procedure prescribed by s 128 for submitting a proposed amendment of the constitution to the informed decision of the people?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe operation of stage 1 - what is political communication?\n\n[the ability of’ “the people” to communicate with each other with respect to matters that could affect their choice in federal elections or constitutional referenda or that could throw light on the performance of [federal] Ministers of State and the conduct of the executive branch of government” - Lange\nExpanded in Unions NSW v NSW (2013) 252 CLR 530:\n\n“The complex interrelationship between levels of government, issues common to state and federal government and the levels at which political parties operate necessitate that a wide view to be taken of the operation of the freedom of political communication:\n\n\n\n\nExamples of political communication\n\nAn allegation of corruption against a police officer in a public place in Queensland (Coleman v Power (2004) 220 CLR 1)\nParole conditions restricting a former prisoners ability to attend public meetings about political advocacy and being made to do media interviews Wotton v Queensland (2023) 246 CLR 1\nVarious acts of journalism (Lange, Theophanous etc)\nCovert video surveillance and publication by animal rights groups (Farm Transparency Ltd v New South Wales)\nNon verbal acts such as entering a hunting ground for advocacy purposes (Levy v Victoria 1997 189 CLR 579)\n\n\nThe operation of stage 1 - what is a burden?\n\nFrench CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan and Bell JJ in Wotton v Queensland (2012) 246 CLR 1:\n“there is a distinction…between laws which…incidentally restrict political communication, and laws which prohibit or regulate communications which are inherently political or a necessary ingredient of political communication.\nThe burden upon communication is more readily seen…if the law is of the former rather the latter description.”\n\n\nThe modified test in Coleman v Power\n\nColeman v Power (2004) 220 CLR 1\n\nGummow, Hayne and Kirby JJ read down the provision – prohibiting ‘insulting words to any person’ - so as to only be applicable when the words used are directed to hurting an identified person and intended to provoke unlawful physical retaliation, which is not the case merely with insulting words to a police officer who, by temperament and training, must be expected to resist the sting of insults.\n\nUnder this interpretation, the provision was reasonably appropriate and adapted to preserving the peace and public order.\n\n\nMcHugh J refused to read it down, and thus held that an ‘unqualified’ prohibition cannot be justified as compatible with the prescribed system.\n\nThe provision infringed the constitutional freedom by simply making it an offence to utter insulting words in or near a public place whether or not a person hears those words, even when they were used in the discussion of political and governmental matters, bearing in mind that the use of insulting words is a legitimate part of the political discussion protected by the Constitution.\n\n\nGleeson CJ, Callinan and Heydon JJ agreed with McHugh J’s broad interpretation, but found that the law was nevertheless proportionate.\n\nKirby J criticised this broad interpretation as being intolerably over-wide, given the reality of Australian politics which often involves insulting language.\n\n\n\n\nIs the law reasonably appropriate and adopted to serve a legitimate end in a manner which is compatible with the maintenance of the constitutionally prescribed system of representative and responsible government and the procedure prescribed by s 128 for submitting a proposed amendment of the constitution to the informed decision of the people?\n\n\nCriticism emerges of Lange second stage\n\nKiefel J in Monis v the Queen [2013] HCA 4:\n\nIn Roach v Electoral Commissioner it was said that what upon close scrutiny is disproportionate or arbitrary may not answer the description “reasonably appropriate and adapted”.\nThis raises the question whether the use of this more cumbersome and inexact phrase should be continued.\n\n\nKiefel J advocated a form of “structured proportionality” adopted from German jurisprudence\n\n\nMcCloy v New South Wales [2015] HCA 34 - HC majority adopts ‘structured proportionality’\n\nFacts: Following a series of corruption scandals that led to corrupt conduct findings by ICAC and recommendations to reform the donation system, the NSW government introduced legislation to curb political donations.\n\nIt introduced a $50,000 cap on all political donations in a financial year.\nIt also imposed a total ban on donations from property developers.\nA developer challenged the validity of these laws in the high court, arguing they infringed the implied freedom of political communication.\n\n\nFrench CJ, Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ adopted ‘structured proportionality’ to the second limb of the Lange test for the first time in a majority judgment.\nThey argued that it provides a “uniform analytical framework for evaluating legislation which effects a restriction on a right or freedom. It is not suggested that it is the only criterion by which legislation that restricts a freedom can be tested. It has the advantage of transparency.”\n\n\nModified Lange test set out in McCloy\n\nSTAGE ONE OF LANGE TEST\n\nDoes the law effectively burden the freedom in its terms, operation or effect?\n\n\nSTAGE TWO OF LANGE TEST (MODIFIED)\n\nAre the purpose of the law and the means adopted to achieve that purpose legitimate, in the sense that they are compatible with the maintenance of the constitutionally prescribed system of representative government[4] …AND…\nis the law reasonably appropriate and adapted to advance that legitimate object[5]? This question involves what is referred to in these reasons as “proportionality testing”\n\n\n\n\nWhat is “proportionality testing def”?\n\nThe proportionality test involves consideration of the extent of the burden effected by the impugned provision on the freedom.\nThere are three stages to the test – these are the enquiries as to whether the law is justified as suitable, necessary and adequate in its balance in the following senses:\n\n\n\nsuitable — as having a rational connection to the purpose of the provision;\n\n\n\n\nnecessary — in the sense that there is no obvious and compelling alternative, reasonably practicable means of achieving the same purpose which has a less restrictive effect on the freedom;\n\n\n\n\nadequate in its balance — a criterion requiring a value judgment, consistently with the limits of the judicial function, describing the balance between the importance of the purpose served by the restrictive measure and the extent of the restriction it imposes on the freedom.\n\n\n\n\nIf the measure does not meet these criteria of proportionality testing, then the…measure will exceed the implied limitation on legislative power.\n\n\nApplication of test in McCloy\n\nStage one McCloy test\n\n\n\nDoes the law effectively burden the freedom in its terms, operation or effect?\n\n\nYes, the law did burden the implied freedom by its operation.\n\nIt limited the ability of property developers and other individuals to participate in the democratic process by curbing their ability to give financial support.\n\n\n\n\nStage two McCloy test\n\n2. Are the purpose of the law and the means adopted to achieve that purpose legitimate, in the sense that they are compatible with the maintenance of the constitutionally prescribed system of representative government[4]?\n\nAnswer: The joint majority found the legislative measure’s purpose was to curb corruption in the political process, which the court found was not only compatible with the maintenance of government, but that they preserve and enhance it” by limiting corruption risks.\n\n\n\n\nis the law reasonably appropriate and adapted to advance that legitimate object[5]? (suitable, necessary and adequate in its balance)\n\n\nAnswer: They were suitable measures, as they were rationally connected to their objectives (e.g. the fact that the business of property developers is extraordinarily dependent upon decisions of governments regarding zoning and planning permits).\n\n\nThey were necessary, in the sense that no obvious and compelling alternatives were identified (e.g. it is not a compelling alternative to limit the laws just to acts of bribery, firstly because of difficulties in proving bribery, and secondly because it is not the subjective intention of the donor that is important as the objective tendency of large payments of money to corrupt government and the electoral system).\nThey are balanced, as they don’t affect the ability of any person to communicate with another about politics or government, nor to seek access to or influence politicians other than by the payment of substantial sums of money.\n\n\nBrown v Tasmania (2017) 261 CLR 328\n\nThe Workplaces (Protection from protestors) Act (Tas) was enacted for the purpose of protecting businesses from certain activities by protestors, and applied to forestry land where forest operations were being carried out.\nTwo protestors (including former Senator Bob Brown) were arrested and charged (though later withdrawn) after protesting in a forestry area to raise awareness against logging.\nA majority (Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ) found the law to breach the implied freedom of political communication:\n\n1.The law did burden the freedom due to restricting peaceful protests.\n2.The purpose of the law, to protect businesses from damage and disruption, was compatible with representative and responsible government.\n3.However, concerning proportionality –\n\n(i)Certain provisions were not suitable (e.g. police powers to direct people to leave an area)\n(ii)Certain provisions were not necessary: in restricting protests more generally, they would deter protest of all kinds; they go beyond what is reasonably necessary to protect against damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnions NSW v New South Wales (Unions NSW [No 2]) [2019] HCA 1\n\nThis was a challenge to certain changes to election funding rules that impacted third-party campaigners in elections, including unions and business groups, which would have impacted the 2019 State election.\n\nAgainst a background of corruption inquiries conducted by ICAC, and conservative perceptions that unions had too much power in election campaigns, s 29(10) of the Electoral Funding Act 2018 (NSW) substantially reduced the cap on electoral expenditure by third-party campaigners from 1,050,000 to 500,000.\n\n\nThe Court unanimously found s29(10) invalid as an impermissible burden on political communication.\n\nIt was accepted that the purpose of the law was to prevent the drowning out of voices by the distorting influence of money and that it did so in relevant part by differentiating between political parties, candidates and third-party campaigners.\nThe issue was one of justification of the extent of the effect of the cap on electoral expenditure on the implied freedom.\nBecause the implied freedom ensures that the people of the Commonwealth enjoy equal participation in the exercise of political sovereignty, it is not surprising that there is nothing in the authorities which supports the submission that the Constitution impliedly privileges candidates and political parties over the electors as sources of political speech.\n\n\n\n\nClubb v Edwards [2019] HCA 11\n\nKathy Clubb and Graham Preston, pro-life advocates and protestors, were separately convicted of offences under the Victorian Public Health and Wellbeing Act 2008 (Vic) and the Tasmanian Reproductive Health (Access to Terminations) Act 2013 (Tas).\n\nClubb was convicted after handing a leaflet to a young woman approaching an abortion clinic.\nShe was found guilty of engaging in communication about abortion reasonably likely to cause distress or anxiety within the safe access zone.\nPreston was convicted for holding up signs within the safe zone, speaking about the rights of unborn children under international law, one of which depicted a foetus.\nBoth appealed to the High Court, arguing that the laws infringed upon the implied freedom of political communication.\n\n\nKiefel CJ, Bell and Keane JJ held:\n\nHanding out anti-abortion pamphlets to women in this case did not amount to political communication.\nA discussion between individuals of the moral or ethical choices to be made by a particular individual is not to be equated with discussion of the political choices to be made by the people of the Commonwealth as the sovereign political authority.\nHowever, the case presented three ‘unusual features’ which warranted dealing with the matter even if it did not involve political communication.\n\n\n\n\nFarm Transparency v New South Wales [2022] HCA 23\n\nFarm Transparency is an animal rights group that routinely obtained and published footage of animals subject to inhumane treatment.\n\nAt times they trespassed on farms and covertly filmed the treatment of animals.\nIn NSW it’s a criminal offence to install a covert surveillance device, and there is no public interest defence (which does apply in certain other states).\n\n\nThey challenged the validity of two provisions of the Surveillance Devices Act; s 11 which prohibits publication or communication of footage and s 12 which prohibits possession of them.\nA majority (Kiefel CJ and Keane, Edelman and Stewart JJ) held that the legislation burdened political communication, but that it had a legitimate purpose of protecting privac - given this, they did not proceed to a proportionality analysis.\n\nGordon J read down the scope of the provisions.\nGageler and Gleeson JJ in dissent found the legislation was invalid, finding it was too restrictive.\n\n\n\n\nSome justices left open the door for different considerations for news organisations\n\nWhat this case is not about\n\nA concerned member of the public, while present at a political event on private premises without invitation, overhears a conversation between senior members of the Government.\nThe senior members of the Government are discussing their participation in an unlawful enterprise involving wiretapping of Opposition premises, and using the Australian Taxation Office and the Australian Secret Intelligence Service to target political opponents.\nThe concerned member of the public uses a smartphone to make an audio‑visual recording of the conversation and provides the recording to a journalist at a national newspaper.\nThe journalist and the editor of the newspaper are aware that the conversation was unlawfully recorded but they want to publish the details to inform the public of these matters of enormous political importance.\nEven if they cannot publish the information, they want to communicate it to the Australian Federal Police.\n\n\n\n\nRECAP – YOUR GUIDE TO PROBLEM SOLVING\n\n\n\nThe implied freedom of political communication is derived from ss 7, 24, 64 and 128 to protect communication on political or government matters.\n\n\n\n\nThis implied freedom creates a constitutional limit on the power of the Commonwealth and states to legislate, and on the common law, and can invalidate laws in certain circumstances.\n\n\n\n\nTo assess whether a law infringes the implied freedom of political communication, apply a modified version of the two stage test that was first adopted in Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation.\n\n\n\n\nStage 1 involves an assessment of whether the law effectively burden the freedom in its terms, operation or effect and Stage 2 involves an assessment of whether the purpose of the law and the means adopted to achieve that purpose legitimate, in the sense that they are compatible with the maintenance of the constitutionally prescribed system of representative government, and if so is the law reasonably appropriate and adapted to advance that legitimate object? (suitable, necessary and adequate in its balance), which was modified in McCloy v NSW in 2015, involves an assessment of proportionality\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 12: Recap\n\nRevision and Exam Tips\n\nExam Topics\n\nCharacterisation and implied incidental power\nCorporations power\nThe Race power\nExternal affairs power\nExecutive/nationhood power\nSeparation of judicial power – Commonwealth and State\nIntergovernmental immunities: Melb Corp; Cigamatic\nExpress Rights: acquisition; trial by jury; freedom of religion\nImplied freedom of political communication\nInconsistency of laws\n\n\nExam Format\n\nconstitutional provisions and case law for each issue (e.g. …‘s51(xxxix) and s61, are authority for the nationhood power (Davis v Cth)’…).

Is the State law inconsistent with the Commonwealth law?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Characterisation\n\nSubject matter powers are given a broad interpretation (Bank Nationalisation Case and Murphyores (1976)), applying the ‘sufficient connection’ test.\n\nTEST - If it’s a subject matter power, does the Cth Act have a sufficient connection to the subject matter? (Kitto J in Fairfax “Is it in real substance a law upon, “with respect to”, one or more of the enumerated subjects”) –\nDual characterisation - a law may have multiple subjects and be attached to multiple heads of power. This is basically the gist of Kitto J’s findings in Fairfax v Cmr of Tax (1965).\nKitto J found that it is a question of the ‘true nature and character of the legislation; is it in its real substance a law with respect to, one or more enumerated subjects, or is there no more in it in relation to any of those subjects than an inference so incidental as not in truth to affect its character?’\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Characterisation – subject matter power\n\nIf there is no sufficient connection but by invoking the implied incidental power it can be brought within the subject matter, we must apply the proportionality test (asking whether the law is “appropriate and adapted” to its purpose (D’Emden v Pedder (1904)): R v Burgess (1936)).\n\nWith respect to the trade and commerce power, for instance, the implied incidental power can be invoked to regulate steps preparatory or ancillary to trade and commerce like manufacturing: Grannall v Marrickville Margarine (1955) (including penalties (Burton v Honan (1952)), or permit regulation of intrastate trade and commerce where it is sufficiently integrated (beyond merely in an economic or commercial sense) with interstate or foreign trade and commerce: O’Sullivan v Noarlunga Meat (1954).\n\n[note: the trade and commerce power is not examinable, but you can refer to these cases to support an argument involving the implied incidental power being used for an examinable head of power]\n\n\nWith respect to the corporations power, the implied incidental power was found to authorise a law which permitted a person who had suffered a loss because of a corporation’s misleading or deceptive conduct to recover that loss from any natural person involved in that deception: Fencott v Miller (1983).\nThe difference between the express and implied incidental power is that the implied incidental power from D’Emden v Pedder (1904) is used to interpret the head of power and the express incidental power (s. 51 (xxxix)) is used to interpret an executive exercise of power under the head of power.\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Characterisation – purposive power\n\nIf its a purpose power, again we use the proportionality test (ie is it appropriate and adapted). This is a test of proportionality between the legislation and the purpose of defence or external affairs or the nationhood power – not necessarily the head of power. Different in each case:\n\nExternal affairs, very broad approach (for treaty implementation and international legal matters, Seas and Submerged Lands Case (1975)), compliant with the ‘spirit’ (Tasmanian Dam); the treaty must be reasonably specific as to what States must do, and the implementing law must conform to the requirements of the treaty (ILO case).\nDefence power (NOT EXAMINABLE) a power that is applied differentially according to the context – war, peace, transitional period; there must be a threat to the Cth and the States; In the absence of war involving a threat to Australia, the court has limited its use (Communist Party Case (1951)); however, in the case of terrorism, counter-terrorism laws may be appropriate and adapted to the purpose of defending Australia and the law (Thomas v Mowbray (2007)).\nNationhood power – a broad power in terms of potential subjects to which it could be applied, but a narrow interpretive approach – must be for the benefit of the nation, and not a punitive or coercive purpose: First Pharmaceutical Benefits Case; Davis v Cth (1988); Pape v Cth (2009)\n\n\n\n\nCharacterisation - Specific heads of power\n\nCorporations Power s. 51(xx):\n\nSubject matter power, thus we apply the sufficient connection test.\nFirst requirement: that the law deals with constitutional corporations: foreign, trading or financial corporations (the latter two formed within the Commonwealth).\n\nIn relation to trading and financial corporations, it would only apply to corporate entities whose trading or financial activities respectively form a significant and substantial, although not a predominant, part of the business (Adamson’s Case (1979); Tasmanian Dams (1983)).\nThis could include sporting clubs, charities (Red Cross Case (1991)), and universities (Quickenden v O’Connor).\nFor companies that have yet to begin to operate, such as shelf companies, we look to the purposes (rather than current activities) of the corporation (Fencott v Muller (1983).\nIt would not include public entities that run at a loss (AWU v Etheridge Shire Council (2008) or that are funded wholly by the state (ALSWA v Lawrence (2008)).\n\n\nSecond requirement: that the law falls within the scope of the power. After Work Choices case (2006), s51(xx) provides near plenary power - there will be such a connection where the law regulates:\n\nthe activities, functions, relationships and the business of constitutional corporations;\nthe creation of rights, and privileges belonging to such a corporation;\nthe imposition of obligations on it;\nthe regulation of the conduct of those through whom it acts, its employees and shareholders and, also, the regulation of\nthose whose conduct is or is capable of affecting its activities, functions, relationships or business; [note that this latter point may more accurately be construed as part of the implied incidental power].\n\n\nIn Work Choices, laws prescribing the industrial rights and obligations of corporations and their employees and the means by which they are to conduct their industrial relations (i.e. internal relationships within a corporation), were held to be within power.\n\n\nThe Race Power (s51(xxvi)\n\n(i) First Requirement: the law must involve ‘race’\n\n‘Race’ is defined as: ‘common history, religion spiritual beliefs, culture, biological origins and physical similarities’ (Tas Dams, per Brennan J); ‘all that makes up personality and identity of people of a race’ (Tas Dams, per Deane J).\n\n\n(ii) Second Requirement: the law must be ‘special’\n\nA self-proclaimed ‘special law’ preserving archaeological relics was validly enacted under s51(xxvi) where it ‘benefited’ a particular race: Tasmanian Dams, per Mason, Murphy, Brennan and Deane JJ.\nA law will be validly enacted pursuant to the race power when it confers ‘a benefit of special significance to a particular race’ (Aboriginal people): Native Title Act Case (1995), (6:1 majority);\n\n\nKartinyeri v Commonwealth (1998):\n\n\nGummow and Hayne JJ applied a literal interpretation of the race power and found that the provision did not contain any qualifications as to whether it could be used for the benefit or disadvantage of Aboriginal people.\n\n\nIn the absence of such qualifiers, a law will be ‘special’ or validly enacted under the race power where it either benefits or ‘disadvantages’ Aboriginal people.\n\n\nIn other words, the race power allows the Parliament to make racist laws.\n\n\nThis was the effect of Brennan CJ, Gaudron and McHugh JJ’s decision, which said that if the law was made under a s51 head of power, it can be unmade (regardless of any benefit or disadvantage).\n\n\nGaudron J added a separate test that a disadvantageous law must be appropriate and adapted (proportionate).\n\n\nBut she did not apply this test to the obviously disadvantageous law made under the race power in the case at hand.\n\n\nKirby J applied a purposive interpretation, concluding that the purpose of the race power is to permit special laws on the grounds of race but not so as to adversely and detrimentally discriminate against people of a particular race (i.e. it must not be disadvantageous).\n\n\nHe reasoned that most Australians thought that this was a key purpose of the 1967 referendum.\n\n\nThe spirit of that referendum, he said, would not allow a racist interpretation of s51(xxvi). He added that where the clause is ambiguous, it should be interpreted in accordance with international law and its instruments.\n\n\n\n\n\nExternal Affairs (s. 51 (xxix)):\n\nSufficient connection test (for matters of mere geographic externality - test: does the law exhibit ‘the mere fact of externality’ (Horta v Cth (1994))?\n\nAlternatively, to satisfy the sufficient connection test we look to the rights, duties, obligations and privileges which it changes, regulates or abolishes; persons, places, matters or things: XYZ v Cth (2006) (or more often than not, the way in which the High Court has characterised factually similar legislation, under the external affairs power).\nOR\nProportionality test (for matters including obligations, agreements, treaties – the Cth may simply enact any treaty obligation\n\n(Koowarta (1982) per Mason, Murphy and Brennan JJ; that has an ‘international character’: Tasmanian Dams (1983) per Mason, Murphy, Deane and Brennan JJ; unanimously accepted in Richardson v Forestry Commission (1988));\n\n\n\n\nLimits:\n\nThe law lacks ‘sufficient specificity’: a regime prescribed by the treaty to direct ‘the general course’ of its implementation by signatories: Vic v Cth (ILO Case) (1996) Majority, or embodies vague sentiments;\nThe law does not comply with the ‘conformity principle’: undermines the character of the international law: ILO Case, majority; (and thereby interferes with domestic legal rights in some way e.g. property rights) per Deane and Gaudron JJ (dissenting) in Richardson.\nThe claimed treaty provisions on which the legislation relies are void or unlawful under international law:\n\nHorta v Cth (1995); OR\n\n\nThe Cth uses international law as a sham or circuitous device in order to rely on its plenary power under the external affairs power:\n\nHorta v Cth (1995).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Characterisation – Executive power\n\nThere are four categories of executive power:\n\n\n\nPrerogative power of the Crown (not examinable)\n\n\n\n\nNationhood power\n\n\n\n\nStatutory power (not examinable)\n\n\n\n\nPower to enter into contracts and spend money (not examinable)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacterisation - Specific heads of power\n\nNationhood (ss. 61 and s. 51 (xxxix)):\n\nThe power may only be exercised for the benefit of the people or nation? (Davis (1988)).\nA purposive power, so the test is whether the law is appropriate and adapted to a purpose which is of benefit to the people or nation.\nLaws potentially constituting a ‘benefit to the nation’ may include:\n\nNational scheme for free medicine (First Pharmaceutical Benefits case (1945))\nEstablishing regional social development councils to support social welfare activities through an Australian Assistance Plan (The AAP case (1975))\nPreserving the environment through World Heritage listing (Tasmanian Dam case (1983))\nCommemoration of Australia’s Bicentenary (Davis v Commonwealth (1988))\nProvision for a tax bonus to stimulate the economy during a fiscal emergency (Pape v Commissioner of Taxation (2009).\n\n\nCould apply to legislation concerning ‘physical property or artistic, intellectual, scientific or sporting achievement or endeavour’, things that are ‘part of the heritage distinctive of the Australian nation’, worthy of ‘protection, preservation or promotion’: Tasmanian Dam case (1983) per Deane J [252]\nNeeds to be peculiarly adapted to the Commonwealth as a national polity, so may not apply to benefits which could readily be provided by the States (Pape).\nIt would not authorise laws which are coercive, punitive or penal in purpose (Tasmanian Dams; Davis; Pape); unless those laws are to ‘maintain and protect’ the Cth (Sharkey; Pape).\n\n\n\n\nCharacterisation - Executive Expenditure, ss81 &amp; 83\n\nExecutive expenditure (an ‘appropriation from the consolidated revenue fund’ and its expenditure, per ss81) must be done pursuant to law: s83\nExpenditure under the nationhood power:\n\nThe nationhood power cannot be used to support such an expenditure because it is not an express s51 head of power (First Pharmaceutical Benefits Case; AAP Case per Mason J; Pape), UNLESS, the expenditure is ‘urgent’ and necessary to ‘avoid … crisis’ or avert a ‘national emergency’ (Pape).\n\n\nExpenditure under other s51 heads of power:\n\nExecutive expenditure will be valid if itemised in legislation, validly made under another s51 head of power: Williams [No 1]; Williams [No 2]; (e.g. the marriage power (s51(xxi) in The Marriage Equality Case).\nIf constitutionally valid, such expenditure may nevertheless be subject to an administrative law remedy of ‘Wednesbury unreasonableness’: that the decision is ‘so outrageous in its defiance of logic or accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it’ (Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Li (2013)).\n\n\n\n\nCharacterisation of a State Law\n\nWhat is the source of authority for the state law?\nConstitution Act 1902 (NSW), s5:\n\n‘The Legislature shall, subject to the provisions of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act, have power to make laws for the peace, welfare and good government of New South Wales in all cases whatsoever’.\n\n\nPlenary power clauses in other state constitutions: QLD, s9; Vic, s16; SA, s5; WA, s2; TAS, s10;\nThis clause means that States possess power to make laws for their peace, welfare and good government, ‘as ample and plenary as that possessed by the Imperial Parliament’, extending to extraterritorial operation: Union Steamship Co of Australia Pty Ltd v King (1988) 166 CLR 1.\nAlmost always valid, unless it interferes with judicial power (Kable) or purports to apply to the Commonwealth in its executive capacity (Cigamatic) or infringes the implied freedom of political communication (Brown); or is inconsistent with a Commonwealth law (s109).\n\n\nStep 2: Limits\n\nSeparation of judicial power (Boilermakers’ principle, Kable principle)\nIntergovernmental immunities (Melbourne Corporation principle; Cigamatic principle)\nTrial by jury\nFreedom of religion\nAcquisition on just terms\nImplied freedom of political communication\n\n\nSeparation of Judicial power\n\n\n\nJudicial power of the Commonwealth may only be exercised by Ch III courts\n\n\n(Wheat Case, Alexander’s Case)\n\n\n\n\nCh III courts may only exercise judicial power (and ancillary non-judicial powers) (Boilermakers Case)\n\n\nApplying these principles requires consideration of:\n\nWhether judicial power is being exercised – thus, the definition of ‘judicial power’;\nWhether the same body also exercises non-judicial functions, such as determining policy, setting industry standards, drafting recommendations, etc.;\nWhether the requirements of judicial office under Ch III, such as tenure to age 70 years, are complied with.\n\n\n\n\nJudicial power – Ch. III\n\nSo what is judicial power?\n\n\n\nBinding and authoritative determination\n\n\n(enforceable, albeit subject to appeal) – Brandy v HREOC (1995); Luton v Lessels (2002)\n\n\n\n\nOf a controversy\n\n\n(must be a ‘matter’; no advisory opinions) – Momcilovic v The Queen (2011)\n\n\n\n\nInvolving existing rights and duties between parties\n\n\n(as opposed to the creation of new rights and duties) – AG v Alinta (2008); ACMA v Today FM (2015)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudicial power – exceptions (Persona designata)\n\nAn appointment to a position of persona designata (judges exercising executive power) will be valid if:\n\ni) The judicial officer accepts or consents to the appointment:\n\nGrollo v Palmer (1995); and\n\n\nii) The functions of the judicial officer are not incompatible with judicial functions and responsibilities:\n\nGrollo; Wilson v Minister for ATSI Affairs (1996)\n\n\n\n\nIncompatibility might arise where:\n\ni) the role requires a ‘permanent and complete’ commitment to the non-judicial function – diversion from judicial duties; or\nii) the non-judicial functions compromise the capacity of the judge to exercise their judicial functions with integrity; or\niii) the nature of the non-judicial functions might diminish public confidence in the integrity of the judicial function (see next slide on this point…): Grollo v Palmer (1995).\n\n\nA non-judicial function might impair or diminish public confidence in the integrity of the judiciary when:\n\nIt involves a function that is closely connected with or part of the functions of the legislature or executive; OR\nThe function will not be performed independently of the advice or wishes of the legislature or executive; OR\nDiscretion will be exercised on political grounds: Wilson v Minister for ATSIA (1996)\n\n\n\n\nSeparation of Judicial power – Kable principle\n\nThere is no doctrine of the separation of powers entrenched in the State constitutions.\n\nHowever, because the State courts are an integral and equal part of the judicial system set up by Ch III, it follows that no State or federal parliament can legislate in a way that might undermine the role of those courts as repositories of federal judicial power (Kable v DPP (1996)).\n\n\nThus, State courts cannot be invested with functions that are incompatible with the exercise of federal judicial power.\nRequired characteristics of ‘institutional integrity’ of State courts:\n\nThe reality and appearance of decisional independence and impartiality (Kable; South Australia v Totani (2010))\nThe application of procedural fairness (International Finance Trust Co v NSW Crime Commission (2009))\nAdherence as a general rule to the open court principle; however, there are a number of situations in which closed court, ex parte hearings and reliance on confidential information are permissible, including where the court retains the capacity to stay an application (Condon v Pompano (2013))\nThe provision of reasons for the courts’ decisions (Wainohu v NSW (2011))\nThe capacity to review a decision on the basis of jurisdictional error (Kirk v Industrial Court of NSW (2010)).\n\n\n\n\nJudicial Power – Examples of the Incompatibility Doctrine in Action\n\nLegislation provided that:\n\n‘The Court must make an order if particular conditions exist’ in ex parte matters - the lack of discretion in hearing and determining ex parte applications from the executive attracted the principle:\n\nInternational Finance Trust Company v NSW Crime Commission (2009);\n\n\n‘The Magistrate’s Court must make a control order after the AG declares an organisation to be involved ‘serious criminal activity’ - lack of discretion attracted the principle:\n\nSA v Totani (2010);\n\n\n‘The Court may declare certain evidence to be admitted against a defendant in secret (a ‘criminal intelligence’ declaration)’ – retained judicial discretion, did not attract the principle:\n\nCondon v Pompano (2013);\n\n\nThe Court had discretion to find that somebody had associated with or was a ‘participant’ in a criminal organisation, following an executive declaration that an organisation was ‘criminal’ - did not interfere with judicial discretion to find that somebody - courts retained judicial discretion:\n\nKuczborski v QLD (2014);\n\n\nThat a Court must make a declaration that a person was a ‘drug trafficker’ upon finding that they had committed three-prior drug offences – the discretion to find three prior offences did not attract the principle:\n\nAG(NT) v Emmerson (2014);\n\n\nPolice may arrest and detain a person for 4 hours – punitive executive detention did not attract the principle:\n\nNAAJA v NT (2015).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntergovernmental immunities - Melbourne Corporation principle\n\nThere is a presumption of Cth legislative supremacy over the States: Engineers (1920); Tas Dams (1983).\nBUT the Melb Corp doctrine applies in respect to Cth laws that burden the States.\nThis doctrine is premised upon ss. 107 + 108 which preserve the power of State Parliaments: per Dixon J, Melbourne Corp (1947).\nTwo Limbs:\n\ni) Does the Cth law discriminate against a State AND\nii) Does the Cth law inhibit; or impair the ability of a State to function?;\n\n\nException: ‘rational discrimination’ – where the Cth law is intended to discriminate against a state for a rational purpose: (Melb Corp v Cth (1947); QEC v Cth (1985));\nNew Test (incorporating previous limbs):\n\nis there a significantly sufficient impairment of the exercise by the State of its freedom to select the manner and method for discharge of its constitutional functions? (Austin v Cth (2003))\n\n\nFrench CJ’s indicia of Melbourne Corp interference from Clarke v Fed Cmr of Taxation (2009):\n\ni) Singles out one or more States for special burden or disability.\nii) A law of general application or does it impose a particular burden or disability.\niii) Inhibits the States from exercising their constitutional powers.\niv) Inhibits the States from exercising their functions.\nv) Nature of the capacity or functions affected.\nvi) Subject matter of the law and its permissibility considering the head of power (e.g. Tas Dams –external affairs, and arguably, defence power).\n\n\n\n\nIntergovernmental immunities - Cigamatic principle\n\nThere is a presumption of Commonwealth legislative supremacy over the States: Engineers (1920); Tasmanian Dam (1983).\nThe Cigamatic principle provides that States have no power to alter the legal relationships existing between the Commonwealth and its subjects (the States cannot bind the Cth).\n\nThis is derived from the notion of Commonwealth supremacy by virtue of ss 109 and 5 of the Constitution (Commonwealth v Cigamatic (1962)).\n\n\nHowever, there is a qualification:\n\nStates have no power to impair the capacities of the Commonwealth executive (defined to mean the rights, powers, privileges and immunities of the Crown (prerogatives)), but State law of general application may regulate the Commonwealth’s activities when it is acting as an ordinary legal person (Residential Tenancies Tribunal case (1997)).\n\n\nThus, Commonwealth and its officers/employees may be bound by:\n\nState criminal law, e.g. road licence requirements (Pirrie v McFarlane (1925)), or\nState tenancy laws (Residential Tenancies Tribunal case).\n\n\n\n\nTrial by Jury: s80 – a limitation\n\nGuarantees trial by jury for indictable, Commonwealth offences: Archdall (1928);\nThe Cth determines whether an offence shall be tried on indictment: Kingswell (1985);\n\nNote: offences punishable by over 12 months imprisonment are indictable, unless otherwise prescribed: Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), s4G.\n\n\nWhere s80 applies, it is mandatory and cannot be waived: Alqudsi (2016);\nS80 requires jury unanimity for a conviction: Cheatle (1993);\nS80 requires a minimum of 10 jurors, but no maximum: Brownlee (2001); Ng (2003)\n\n\ns. 116 Freedom of Religion – a limitation\n\nThe express freedom of religion contains four limbs:\n\n\n\nNo Establishment of religion – the ‘Establishment clause’\n\n\n\n\nNo Imposition of Religious observance – the ‘Religious observance clause’\n\n\n\n\nNo Prohibiting Free Exercise – the ‘Free exercise clause’\n\n\n\n\nNo religious test for public office – the ‘Religious test clause’\n\n\n\n\n\n\ns. 116 Freedom of Religion: Interpretation by the HCA\n\nDefinitions of religion:\n\n‘belief in a supernatural being, thing or principle’ etc: Scientology Case; AND recognised ‘canons of conduct’: Jehovah’s Witnesses Case.\n\n\n\n\n‘Establishment’ limb: s. 116 only prohibits laws that expressly seek to establish a single state religion (government funding to religious schools is acceptable):\n\n\nDOGS Case (1981);\n\n\n\n\n‘Religious observance’ limb never tested;\n\n\n\n\n‘Prohibition’ limb: the freedom only limits laws that expressly prohibit religion; and not when authorised by other heads of power (e.g. defence power; territories power): Kryger (1912); Jehovah’s Witnesses Case (1943); Kruger (1996).\n\n\n\n\n‘Religious test for public office’ limb: religious qualifications are acceptable if the officeholder is employed by an intermediary/contractor: Williams (No. 1)\n\n\n\n\nAcquisition of property on just terms – section 51(xxxi)\n\nSubject matter power, so test is whether the law has a sufficient and substantial connection with an acquisition of property.\nNote:\n\nThough a head of power, it also contains a limitation: the requirement of just terms.\nOnly applies to an acquisition for a purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws.\n\nThis means that acquisitions conventionally require dual characterization under another s51 head of power.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs there property?\n\n\n‘Property’ is a general term, meaning ‘any tangible or intangible thing which the law protects under the name of property’ (Minister of State for the Army v Dalziel (1944).\nIt ‘extends to innominate and anomalous interests and includes the assumption and indefinite continuance of exclusive possession and control for the purposes of the Commonwealth of any subject of property’ (Bank Nationalisation Case (1948).\n\n\n\n\nIs there an acquisition? (TWO views)\n\n\nThere is a broad view which tends to confirm a s51(xxxi) acquisition and, in the absence of just terms, this renders the acquisition invalid:\n\nPartial acquisition is sufficient &amp; Cth itself need not acquire an interest: PJ Magennis v Cth (1949)\nCth need not acquire a proprietary right, an ‘identifiable and measurable advantage’ or mere ‘benefit’ will suffice: Deane J (Tas Dams); a proprietary right lost but not gained by the Cth will suffice: Newcrest (1997); advantage or benefit: Smith v ANL (2000);\nA right to sue can be proprietary: Georgiadis;\n\n\nThere is narrow view which tends to deny a s51(xxxi) acquisition and, in the absence of just terms, renders the Cth’s interference with or taking of property valid:\n\nCth must acquire a proprietary interest, rather than a mere deprivation (Restrictions on property use – not proprietary\n\nTas Dams (1983) (Plurality);\nWMC Resources (1998); (Intellectual property regulation through tobacco advertising is not proprietary)\nJT International v Cth (2012); (compound property/acquisition view);\n\n\nStatutory benefits are not proprietary, since inherently susceptible to alteration or repeal:\n\nPeverill (1994);\n\n\nIncidental and punitive acquisition:\n\nNo s51(xxxi) acquisition where acquisition is incidental to another HOP (often for the purposes of punishment):\n\nRe DPP;\nEx parte Lawler (1994) (s51(x) punishment);\nTheophanous (2006) (s51(xxxvi) punishment);\nEmmerson (2014) (NT Self-Govt Act- criminal punishment);\nNintendo (1994) (s51(xviii) regulatory laws);\nCompass Airlines Case (1999) (s51(i); s51(xxix) lien /fee for services)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHave just terms been paid?\n\n\nDetermining what is just and fair by looking at all the interests involved, i.e. community and government interests rather than simply market value (Nelungaloo v Commonwealth (1948); or\nFully compensating the owner of the property at market value (Smith; Georgiadis) (suggested by textbook).\n‘Reasonable’ compensation as determined by courts or tribunals, may qualify as just terms (Wurridjal v Commonwealth (2009)\n\n\n\n\nImplied Freedom of Political Communication\n\nThe implied freedom is derived from ss. 7, 24, 64 &amp; 128 of the Constitution:\n\nLange v ABC (1997);\n\n\nIt is a constitutional limitation on the power of all three branches of government;\nIt is not a personal right or ‘sword’ permitting free speech to be asserted by individuals against all and sundry, but rather, a limitation on, immunity or ‘shield’ against government action that interferes with citizens’ ability to communicate about political issues: Lange.\nTwo alternative tests:\n\nTest from Lange v ABC (1997) modified by Coleman v Power [2004] HCA 39:\n\ni) Does the law burden freedom of communication about government or political matters, either in its terms, operation or effect?\nii) Is the law reasonably appropriate and adapted to serve a legitimate end in a manner which is compatible with the maintenance of representative government?\n\n\nOR, the new test from McCloy v NSW (2015), per French CJ, Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ:\n\ni) Does the law burden the freedom (of comm. about govt &amp; politics)?\nii) Is its purpose legitimate and compatible with representative government?\niii) Is the law reasonably appropriate and adapted to advance a legitimate object (proportionality)? (three steps:\n\nsuitability (rational connection to purpose);\nnecessity (obvious and compelling alternatives);\nbalance (value judgment re public purpose)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes the law “burden” communication on government and political matters in its terms, operation or effect?\n\n\nFreedom applies to restrict both Federal and State legislative power:\n\nUnions NSW v NSW (2013)\n\n\nProtected “communication” includes non-verbal communication and protest:\n\nLevy v Victoria (1997) 189 CLR 579;\nBrown v Tasmania [2017] HCA 43\n\n\nProtected “communication” may be offensive, critical, untruthful:\n\nColeman v Power (2004) 220 CLR 1;\nMonis v The Queen (2013)\n\n\nGovernment and Political matters include:\n\nMatters relevant to state, as a well as federal elections:\n\nUnions NSW;\n\n\nPotentially, it even includes the conduct of foreign governments:\n\nLange v ABC\n\n\nConduct of officers of the C’th and the States:\n\nColeman v Power (2004)\n\n\nA permissive/broad approach to what constitutes a communication on Government and political matters.\n\n\nGovernment and Political matters do not include:\n\nDiscussion of the judiciary, not connected with legislative or executive action:\nHerald &amp; Weekly Times v Popovic (2003)\nCommercial advertising:\n\nAPLA v Legal Services Commissioner (NSW) (2005)\n\n\nPrivate communications about moral and ethical choices:\n\nClubb v Edwards (2019)\n\n\n\n\n“Burdens” may be indirect:\n\nLaws restricting political donations burden the freedom because they limit funds available to meet the costs of political communication by the recipient:\n\nUnions NSW;\nMcCloy v NSW [2015].\n\n\nPotentially could include burden on speech by the act of donation itself\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes the law serve another legitimate purpose compatible with the system of “representative and responsible government” prescribed by the Constitution?\n\n\nThe application of the “compatibility test” in McCloy:\n\n“A legitimate purpose is one which is compatible with the system of representative government provided for by the Constitution; which is to say that the purpose does not impede the functioning of that system and all that it entails. So too must the means chosen to achieve the statutory object be compatible with that system” - French CJ, Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ;\n\n\n“Legislative regulation of the electoral process directed to the protection of the integrity of the process is, therefore, prima facie, legitimate.”: McCloy.\n\n\n\n\nIs the law “reasonably appropriate and adapted” to advance that legitimate object? I.e. is it “suitable”, “necessary” and “adequate”.\n\n\nApplication of the “proportionality test” in McCloy:\n\nSuitability - “…contributes to the realisation of the statute’s legitimate purpose … a rational connection between the provision in question and the statute’s legitimate purpose”;\nNecessity – “availability of other, equally effective, means of achieving the legislative object which have a less restrictive effect on the freedom and which are obvious and compelling…’; and\nAdequate in its balance -“compares the positive effect of realising the law’s proper purpose with the negative effect of the limits on constitutional rights or freedoms. It requires an “adequate congruence … consideration of the importance of the purpose and the benefit sought to be achieved” - French CJ, Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Inconsistency of laws, s109\n\ns 109 of the Constitution: where there is an inconsistency between a Commonwealth and State law, the Commonwealth law shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.\nS 109 generally applies where there are two laws (State and Federal) which are in conflict.\n\nNot to be confused with disputes over federalism where a single law of either the Commonwealth or a State discriminates against or affects the other in some material way.\nNevertheless, where the cover field test applies because the fields are clearly different, there may also be a Melb Corp or Cigamatic issue.\n\n\nFor there to be inconsistency, there must be a valid state law and a valid federal law, otherwise s. 109 does not apply.\n\nHence the reason s109 issues are resolved last.\n\n\n\n\ns. 109 – Tests of Inconsistency (apply all)…\n\n\n\nDUAL or SIMULTANEOUS OBEDIENCE TEST - Where it is impossible to obey both laws (must vs must not, conflict) – a form of direct inconsistency;\n\n\nR v Brisbane Licensing Court; Ex parte Daniell (1920)\n(eg QLD law: referenda must be held on same day as senate elections / Cth law: said they must not).\n\n\n\n\nRIGHTS AND DUTIES or CONFERRAL OF RIGHTS TEST – One law confers rights and the other modifies it – usually possible to obey both (can vs can albeit differently, conflict) – a form of direct inconsistency;\n\n\nClyde Engineering Co Ltd v Cowburn (1926); (eg NSW law: 44 hr week / Cth law: 48 hr week);\nColvin v Bradley Brothers Pty Ltd (1943).\n\n\n\n\nCOVER THE FIELD TEST - Where the Cth expresses a legislative intention to ‘cover the field’ (all the law there is on a particular topic) – a form of indirect inconsistency, (‘cover the field test’ much broader and no real tangible conflict required):\n\n\nClyde Engineering Co Ltd v Cowburn (1926);\nVictoria v Cth (The Kakariki) (1937);\nWenn v AG (VIC) (1948).\n\n\n\n\n‘Cover the field’ test: Wenn v AG Victoria (1948)\n\ni) What is the field(s)?

We must doubt, however, whether the cover the field test ultimately is a true “test” with stable indicia producing reliable and consistent outcomes.\r\nWeek 9: Intergovernmental Immunities\r\n● The doctrine of implied immunities and the Engineers Case\r\n○ Implied immunities def\r\n○ In cases where the legislation of one government is purporting to bind a member of the executive of the other government, a preliminary issue is whether the legislation at issue has rebutted the common law presumption of Crown (or executive) immunity\r\n● Commonwealth legislative power of the states (State Banking Case and discriminatory laws)\r\n○ The State Banking Case ( Melbourne Corporations Case)\r\n○ Discriminatory laws\r\n● TEST: Impairment or curtailment of State’s capacity to function\r\n○ Differnet views on implied prohibition\r\n○ The prohibition was endorsed by the majority in Victoria v Commonwealth (Payroll Tax case) (1971) 122 CLR 353.\r\n○ Western Australia v Commonwealth (Native Title Act case) (1995) 183 CLR 373, the State of Western Australia challenged the validity of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth)\r\n○ Fortescue Metals Group v Commonwealth (2013) 250 CLR 548\r\n○ The prohibition was not applied to invalidate a Commonwealth law until 1995 in Re Australian Education Union; Ex parte Victoria.\r\n○ Austin v Commonwealth (2003) 215 CLR 185\r\n○ Clarke v Commissioner of Taxation [2009] HCA 33\r\n● State legislative power over the Commonwealth (Cigamatic doctrine)\r\n○ Commonwealth Reciprocity - History\r\n○ The folly of Cigamatic: Reciprocity abandoned\r\n○ The “affected by” doctrine\r\n○ Section 64 of the Judiciary Act\r\n○ Characterising a State law (under a State Constitution)\r\nWeek 10: Express Rights\r\n● Introduction\r\n○ The Commonwealth Constitution contains a few express guarantees of individual rights:\r\n● ACQUISITION OF PROPERTY ON JUST TERMS – SECTION 51(XXXI)\r\n○ Section 51(xxxi) reads:\r\n○ Minister for the Army v Dalziel (1944) 68 CLR 26\r\n○ “acquisition” does not have to be by the Commonwealth directly, though it must be effected by a law of the Commonwealth.\r\n○ Acquisition vs deprivation: What needs to be acquired?\r\n○\n\nAustralia Constitution Cheat Sheet\n\nChapter I - The Parliament\n\nPart I - General: Establishes the legislative branch of the Federal Government, consisting of the Queen (represented by the Governor-General), the Senate, and the House of Representatives.\nPart II - The Senate: Details the composition, election, and terms of the Senate, including provisions for state representation.\nPart III - The House of Representatives: Outlines the composition, election, and terms of the House of Representatives, including provisions for population-based representation.\nPart IV - Both Houses of the Parliament: Covers joint provisions for both houses, including sessions, powers, and privileges.\nPart V - Powers of the Parliament: Enumerates specific legislative powers granted to the Federal Parliament, including taxation, defense, trade, and immigration.\n\n\nChapter II - The Executive Government\n\nOutlines the executive branch, detailing the roles of the Governor-General, the Federal Executive Council, and the ministers.

century jurist, A V Dice\nParliament has the constitutional power to “make or unmake any law whatever; and further, that no person or body is recognised by the law of England as having a right to override or set aside the legislation of Parliament”\n\n\nThe powers of all Australian legislatures are constrained by the Commonwealth Constitution\n\nFor example, s 92 prescribes that trade, commerce and intercourse between the States “shall be absolutely free”.\n\nTherefore, no law of any Parliament may impede that freedom\n\n\nJudges will only strike down statutes in Australia if there is constitutional authority for such disallowance, either by express words or necessary implication.\n\nLeave the ethics to the parliament\nUnion Steamship v King (1988) 166 CLR\n\nargument that the power of the New South Wales legislature under the New South Wales Constitution to make laws “for the peace, order and good government of New South Wales” was restricted to laws which facilitated the general welfare of people in New South Wales.\n\nBecames s 51(xxvi) of the constitution\nBecame race power\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rule of Law\n\nAccording to Dicey, the rule of law had three main facets.\n\nFirst, the rule of law meant “the absolute supremacy of regular law as opposed to the influence of arbitrary power,\n\nthe law should be clear, easily accessible, comprehensible, prospective rather than retrospective and relatively stable.\nand excludes the existence of arbitrariness,\nof prerogative or even of wide discretionary authority on the part of the government”.\n\nThe law’s application should also be predictable, consistent and non-discriminatory, thus there is a need to minimise the discretion available to administrative decision-makers.\n\n\n\n\nThe second aspect of Dicey’s definition of the rule of law is that\n\nthere should be “equality before the law” as between the governors and the governed to be subjected to the same law in the same courts as private citizens.\n\n\nDicey outlined his third and final aspect of the rule of law thus:\n\nwith [Englishmen] the law of the constitution, the rules which in foreign countries naturally form part of a constitutional code, are not the source, but the consequence of the rights of individuals, as defined and enforced by the courts.\n\n\n\n\nLord Bingham’s eight key principles or sub-rules\n\nFirst, law must be “accessible and so far as possible intelligible, clear and predictable”;32 with this comes a caution against adventurous judicial activism\nSecond is the caution against arbitrariness: “questions of legal right and liability should ordinarily be resolved by application of the law and not the exercise of discretion”.\nThird, equality before the law is fundamental.\nFourth, “ministers and public officers at all levels must exercise the powers conferred on them in good faith, fairly, for the purpose for which the powers were conferred, without exceeding the limits of such powers and not unreasonably” AKA Administrative Law\nFifth, “the law must afford adequate protection of fundamental human rights”.\nSixth, the state must provide a way of “resolving, without prohibitive cost or inordinate delay, bona fide civil disputes which the parties themselves are unable to resolve”\nSeventh, “adjudicative procedures provided by the state should be fair”\nEighth, Bingham proposed that “compliance by the state with its obligations in international law as in national law\n\n\n\n\nConstitutional conventions\n\nConstitutional conventions def\n\nConstitutional conventions are customs or practices that are habitually followed by governments, who are under a moral or political obligation to continue following them.\nTheir breach does not, however, attract any legal sanction.\nExample: Governor-General and Whitlam government\n\n\nBicameralism def\n\nTwo houses of Parliament\n\nThe lower house is the popularly elected house, and generally has the most power.\nThe upper house is the Senate.\n\nElected as well\nCan veto bills\n\nEven money bills\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepresentative government def\n\nthe make-up of the lower house of Parliament, and basically means that the lower house is democratically elected,48 though the method of actual election is variable\nall lower houses in the Australian States and at the federal level are democratically elected.\n\n\nResponsible government def\n\nthe executive is responsible to the legislature.\nMinisters, in turn, including the Prime Minister, may only remain in government while they have the confidence of the House.\n\nIn practice, this means that the government will only stay in power while their party or coalition commands a majority in the House of Representatives.\n\n\nThe executive government is responsible to the lower house, which is itself responsible to the electorate via the doctrine of representative government.\n\nHowever, given strict party discipline, it is rare for lower house majorities to truly hold the executive to account\n\n\n\n\nParliamentary control of supply\n\nsupply def\n\nthe budget for the ordinary annual services of the government\n\n\nmust be authorised by Parliament.\n\nss 81 and 83 Commonwealth Const.\n\n\nThe only constitutional restriction on Senate power regarding money bills arises from s 53 of the Constitution, which requires that such bills originate in the House of Representatives, and denies the Senate powers to amend such bills.\n\nWhitlam 1975\n\n\n\n\nFederalism\n\nAustralia is a federal state so constitutional power is shared between two levels of government.\nThere are seven autonomous governments:\n\nthe federal government operating from Canberra, and the six regional State governments\n\n\nDecentralisation allows for more local participation in decision- making.\n\nFederalism is also a means of preserving the rights and preferences of local communities as well as minorities who are confined to certain territories.\n\n\ns 109, which dictates that Commonwealth laws prevail over State laws in cases of inconsistency, arguably renders it too easy, via the “cover the field” test,\n\n\n\n\nFROM COLONISATION TO FEDERATION\n\nIn any case, any question of the legal validity in English law was treated as settled by the passage in 1828 by the Imperial Parliament of the Australian Courts Act 1828 (UK)\n\nBy establishing a formal legal system through the Australian Courts Act 1828, the British Parliament was effectively reinforcing the claim over Australia as part of the British Empire.\nThis act, along with other legislative and administrative measures, signified to other nations that Britain was asserting sovereignty over Australia.\n\n\nFrom dictatorship to responsible government\n\nBefore 1823, New South Wales (then the only Australian colony) was essentially ruled by the Governor as a form of military dictatorship.\nAfter that date, the powers of the Governor were slowly diminished, or delegated, until eventually each colony developed a system of responsible government with a bicameral Parliament including a popularly elected lower house.\n\nNew South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania adopted a system of responsible government in 1855,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW OF THE CONSTITUTION\n\n\nThe Commonwealth Constitution is arranged in eight chapters\n\n\nThe Parliament\n\nChapter I deals with the Commonwealth legislature, and is divided into five parts.\n\nPart I deals with general matters relating to the Parliament.\n\nSection 1 vests legislative power in the Commonwealth Parliament, and defines the Parliament as constituting the Queen, the Senate (upper house) and the House of Representatives (lower house).\nThe Queen’s representative is deemed to be the Governor-General in s 2.\nThe Governor-General’s main parliamentary role is to assent to legislation.\nBy convention, he or she always does.\ns 5 permits the Governor-General to dissolve the lower house “as he thinks fit”.\n\nAgain, this power is conventionally exercised on the advice of the Prime Minister.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe House of Representatives\n\nPart III deals with the House of Representatives.\n\ns 24 provides the method of election of the House\n\n\nAs the lower house of Parliament, the House of Representatives follows the tradition of the House of Commons by being the representative “people’s house”.\n\nEach Member of the House of Representatives represents a certain constituency or electorate, with all electorates containing roughly the same population to ensure the equality of each elector’s vote.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Senate\n\nPart II deals with the Senate. Most of its sections mirror those in Pt III by providing for matters such as the method of electing the Senate, duration of the Senate, qualifications of voters, Senate vacancies, Senate qualifications, resignations and quorums.\nSame as US Senate\nthe eligibility of people to run for or even nominate to run for Parliament in an election is governed by s 44 of the Constitution.\n\n\n\nRelative powers of each House of Parliament\n\nPart V deals with the powers of Parliament, including the relative powers of each House of Parliament\nThus, each valid law must be passed by a simple majority in both the House and the Senate and then receive the assent of the Governor-General under s 58.\n\nThe Senate legally has a power of veto over all laws, including money bills\n\n\nThe Senate is also currently elected by proportional representation, which yields a different distribution of Senate positions to that produced by the constituency-based voting system for the House of Representatives.\nSenate is often different politically from HoR\n\ns 57 provides a process for resolving deadlocks.\n\nIt provides for an alternative legislative procedure, which allows laws to be passed without formal Senate approval\n\n\nCan trigger double dissolution def\n\nthe submission of the House of Representatives and the entire Senate to an election\n\n\nDouble dissolution is Non-justiciable def\n\nthe decision to dissolve parliament, including the conditions leading to such a decision, is typically not subject to judicial review.\nThis is because such decisions are considered to be within the exclusive domain of the executive and legislative branches, reflecting the principle of the separation of powers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPowers of the Commonwealth Parliament\n\nPart V of Chapter I also deals with the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament as an entity.\n\ns 51 spells out 39 separate legislative powers that may be exercised by the Parliament.\n\nThe s 51 powers are largely held concurrently with the State Parliaments.\n\n\ns 52 spells out three powers exclusively held by the Commonwealth.\n\n\nAn exercise of Commonwealth legislative power must be specifically authorised by the Commonwealth Constitution or the legislation will be invalid.\n\n\n\nChapter II: The Executive\n\nChapter II of the Constitution deals with the executive power of the Commonwealth.\n\ns 61 prescribes that executive power is vested in the Governor-General.\ns 64 provides for the appointment of Ministers of the Crown to head administrative departments.\nIt is in the arena of executive power where conventions are probably most prevalent and most important.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter III: The judiciary\n\nChapter III deals with the federal judicature.\ns 71 provides for the exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth in the High Court, other federal courts and State courts.\nThe judicial power of the Commonwealth is defined in ss 75 and 76, and coincides with the original jurisdiction of the High Court.\ns 73 describes the appellate jurisdiction of the High Court.\ns 72 deals with the tenure of federal Judges.\nThe chapter also contains a limited guarantee of trial by jury in s 80\n\n\n\nChapter IV: Finance and trade\n\nCommercial considerations provided some of the main impetus for federation\n\ns 81 and 83 provide for Parliamentary control over executive money-raising and expenditure.\nss 88-92 are designed to harmonise customs and excise policies throughout the nation, and create a free trade area within Australia.\ns 96 provides for the provision of financial aid by the Commonwealth to any State.\nss 105 and 105A provide that commonwealth may make arrangements to take over State debts and raise loans.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter V: The transformation of the colonies into States\n\nChapter V formally transforms the pre-existing six colonies into States of the Commonwealth.\ns 107 confirms that the States retain their colonial powers except to the extent that those powers have been removed by the Constitution.\ns 109 provides that, in the case of such inconsistency, the Commonwealth Act prevails\n\n\n\nChapter VI: New States and the Territories\n\nChapter VI deals with new States\n\n\n\nChapter VII\n\ns 125 prescribes the location of the seat of the federal government, the Australian Capital Territory.\ns 126 authorises the Governor-General to delegate some of his duties to deputies\ns 127 used to prescribe that Aborigines would not be counted in the census for “reckoning the numbers of people” in the Commonwealth or the States\n\n\n\nChapter VIII: Amendment of the Constitution\n\nChapter VIII contains only one provision, s 128, which deals with amendment to the Constitution.\nAll statutes except the Constitution may be amended or repealed, expressly or impliedly, by subsequent inconsistent legislation.\ns 128 can also be seen as a head of power.\n\nThe Constitution was passed as part of an Imperial Statute, so upon federation the Commonwealth would not have had any power of amendment without the inclusion of s 128.\n\n\ns 128 is known as a “restrictive procedure” or a “manner and form” provision in that it restricts the manner in which Parliament may amend the Constitution AKA Entrenchment\n\n\n\n\nAmendment and Appraisal/Referendum\n\nEntrenchment distinguishes the Commonwealth Constitution from the State constitutions.\n\nThe State constitutions followed more closely the British tradition of parliamentary sovereignty as none are entirely protected by a restrictive procedure like s 128\ndouble majority def:\n\na majority of voters nationwide and a majority of voters in a majority of states\n\n\n\n\nReferedum of the Constitution\n\nA referendum in 1967 amended s 51(xxvi) to give the Commonwealth power over “the aboriginal race”, and deleted s 127.\n\n\n\n\nCUTTING THE APRON STRINGS: FROM FEDERATION TO THE AUSTRALIA ACTS\n\nUpon federation, the Australian colonies (the renamed States) remained subordinated to the Westminster Parliament under s 2 of the Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865 (Imp)\nStatute of Westminster\n\nThe first major emancipating step was the passage of the Statute of Westminster 1931.\nThe Statute did not apply to Australia until it was specifically adopted by the Commonwealth Parliament (s 10).\nThis occurred with the passage of the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942, with adoption backdated to the beginning of the Second World War in 1939\n\n\n\n\nThe Australia Acts\n\nThe States remained legally subservient to the United Kingdom until Australia Acts (Request) Act 1986\nAuthorized by Section 51(xxxviii) appears to authorise the exercise of considerable legislative power by the Commonwealth if it can obtain the request and consent of the relevant States.\n\n\n\nWeek 1: Intro to the Australian Constitution

interpretation\n\nWestern Australia v Commonwealth (Territorial Senators case) (1975) 134 CLR 201.\n\nProcedural History:\n\nThe case reached a conclusion with a 4:3 majority in the High Court of Australia, affirming the validity of the Senate (Representation of Territories) Act 1973 (Cth).\n\n\nOriginal Dispute:\n\nThe dispute centered on whether the Act, allowing for the representation of Territories in the Senate, was constitutional.\n\n\nReason for Trial:\n\nThe constitutional challenge was based on the interpretation of Section 7 and Section 122 of the Australian Constitution, concerning the composition of the Senate and the representation of Territories.\n\n\nMaterial Facts:\n\nSection 7 of the Constitution states the Senate shall be composed of Senators for each State, while Section 122 allows Parliament to permit Territory representation in either House of Parliament to the extent it deems fit.\n\n\nIssue Raised:\n\nWhether the Senate (Representation of Territories) Act 1973, creating Territorial Senators, was authorized by Section 122 of the Constitution, in light of Section 7’s wording.\n\n\nLaw(s)/Statute(s) in Contention:\n\nConstitution of Australia, particularly ss 7 and 122.\n\n\nPrecedences:\n\nThe case analysis invoked previous interpretations of the Constitution, especially the Amalgamated Society of Engineers v Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd (Engineers case) (1920), which emphasized literal interpretation of the Constitution’s express provisions.\n\n\nTests:\n\nThe majority and minority applied textual and contextual interpretation methods to the Constitution’s provisions.\nConstruing methods\n\nLiteral interpretation\n\nReading down def\n\ntakes place when there is more than one possible reading of the legislative text and a

it”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWords and Phrases Considered:\n\n“Composition” in Section 7 and “Representation” in Section 122.\n\n\nArguments:\n\nThe majority argued s 122 authorized the creation of Territorial Senators and that Section 7 only provided for the Senate’s initial composition.\nThe minority viewed Section 7 as prescribing an exclusive composition of State representatives for all time.\n\nUsed the majority argument to argue that the required interpretation would change the meaning of s 121 “representation”, unreasonable\n\n\n\n\nJudicial Opinions:\n\nMason J (majority) suggested s 7 made exhaustive provision for the Senate’s composition until Parliament utilized s 122 for Territory representation.\nGibbs J (minority) proposed a broader interpretation of “representation” that could include non-voting delegates from Territories.\n\n\nLegal Reasoning:\n\nThe majority justified reading down s 7 in light of s 122, interpreting the Constitution as a coherent whole.\nThe minority emphasized the importance of maintaining the Senate as a States’ house and questioned the majority’s interpretation of transitional provisions.\n\n\nRatio Decidendi:\n\nThe Act was deemed valid as s 122 was interpreted to authorize the creation of Territorial Senators, reading down s 7 to pertain to the Senate’s initial composition.\n\n\nResult:\n\nThe Senate (Representation of Territories) Act 1973 was upheld, allowing for the representation of Territories in the Senate.\n\n\nRelevance to Modern Law:\n\nThis decision affirms the flexibility of the Australian Constitution in adapting to changing governance needs, highlighting the High Court’s role in interpreting foundational texts through both textual and contextual lenses.\nIt underscores the balance between the Constitution’s literal words and the practical necessities of modern governance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTextual vs contextual interpretation\n\nNew South Wales v Commonwealth (Work Choices case) (2006) 229 CLR\n\nProcedural History:\n\nThis case was a constitutional challenge against the Work Choices legislation enacted by the Commonwealth Government, focusing on the corporations power under section 51(xx) of the Constitution.\n\n\nOriginal Dispute:\n\nThe dispute centered on whether the Work Choices legislation, which aimed to reform industrial relations laws, was valid under the corporations power granted to the Commonwealth by the Constitution.\n\n\nReason for Trial:\n\nThe key legal question was the scope of the Commonwealth’s legislative power under section 51(xx), particularly whether it extended to enacting comprehensive industrial relations laws affecting corporations.\n\n\nMaterial Facts:\n\nThe Work Choices legislation significantly expanded the Commonwealth’s role in regulating industrial relations, applying to a broad range of corporations across Australia.\n\n\nIssue Raised:\n\nWhether section 51(xx) of the Constitution, the corporations power, authorized the Commonwealth to legislate on industrial relations as comprehensively as the Work Choices Act did.\n\n\nLaw(s)/Statute(s) in Contention:\n\nThe Australian Constitution, especially section 51(xx) concerning the corporations power, and section 51(xxxv) related to industrial relations.\n\n\nPrecedences:\n\nThe case involved an analysis of constitutional interpretation principles, notably the distinction between textual and contextual interpretation methods.\n\n\nTests:\n\nThe case did not introduce a new legal test but focused on applying established principles of constitutional interpretation to the specific provisions at issue.\n\n\nWords and Phrases Considered:\n\n“Corporations power” in section 51(xx) and its interaction with “industrial relations power” in section 51(xxxv).\n\n\nArguments:\n\nThe majority favored a broad, textual interpretation of section 51(xx), leading to extensive Commonwealth legislative power over corporations.\nThe minority, particularly Justices Kirby and Callinan, advocated for a contextual approach, arguing that section 51(xx) should be read in conjunction with section 51(xxxv), thereby limiting the scope of the corporations power in the area of industrial relations.\n\n\nJudicial Opinions:\n\nJustices Kirby and Callinan, in the minority, emphasized the importance of reading the Constitution as a coherent whole, arguing against isolating section 51(xx) from the broader constitutional framework, particularly section 51(xxxv).\n\n\nLegal Reasoning:\n\nThe majority’s reasoning reflected a preference for a literal interpretation of the Constitution’s text, granting the Commonwealth expansive legislative power.\nIn contrast, the minority’s reasoning was grounded in a holistic approach to constitutional interpretation, advocating for a balance between different powers and ensuring no single provision undermines the relevance of others.\n\n\nRatio Decidendi:\n\nThe High Court’s majority ruled that the Commonwealth’s corporations power under section 51(xx) supported the Work Choices legislation, allowing for broad legislative authority over corporations, including aspects of industrial relations.\n\n\nResult:\n\nThe Work Choices legislation was upheld as valid under the Constitution, affirming the Commonwealth’s expansive legislative power over corporations.\n\n\nRelevance to Modern Law:\n\nThis decision is a landmark in Australian constitutional law, illustrating the tension between textual and contextual interpretations of the Constitution.\nIt significantly impacted the distribution of legislative powers between the Commonwealth and the States, especially in the realm of industrial relations, and set a precedent for the scope of the corporations power.\n\n\n\n\nOriginalist arguments\n\nOriginalist interpretation def\n\nStatutes are generally to be interpreted in accordance with the meaning that they had on the day they were passed\n\n\n\n\nCommonwealth v Australian Capital Territory (2013) 250 CLR 441 concerned the validity of Australian Capital Territory legislation which provided for marriages between adults of the same sex.\n\nThat law was struck down as it was inconsistent with federal legislation (see [7.60]).\nA preliminary finding concerned the scope of federal power under its constitutional marriage power in s 51(xxi)\n\n\nSingh v Commonwealth (2004) 222 CLR 322\n\nSingh was born in Australia in 1998 to Indian parents.\nShe was an Indian citizen by virtue of the citizenship of her parents. Under Australian law, she was not an Australian citizen despite the location of her birth.\nShe and her parents were to be deported under s 198 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) as unlawful non- citizens\nA majority of 5:2 found that Singh could be classified as an alien under the aliens power, so her proposed deportation would be valid\nThe rule from Cole regarding the proper interpretational use of the Debates\n\nCole v Whitfield, to “identifying the contemporary meaning of language used”, that is, its meaning at the time of the Convention Debates, directs attention to the historical context in which language, the subject of a problem of interpretation, was\nThe Court clarified that the intention behind a piece of legislation, as might be expressed in parliamentary debates or second reading speeches, is not determinative of its constitutional validity. Instead, what matters is the actual effect of the law in question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparative arguments\n\nIn the absence of Australian precedents, and even in their presence, judges sometimes look to comparable overseas precedents for guidance\n\nIn the Territorial Senators case, both the majority and minority relied to some extent on comparisons with the jurisdiction of the United States.\n\n\n\n\nPolicy arguments\n\nTraditional interpretative techniques are designed to ensure that judges resort to “legal” rather than political reasoning in making their decisions.\n\n\nStare decisis\n\nthe principle of stare decisis is regarded as having less influence in constitutional cases, compared to non-constitutional cases, due to the fact that Parliament cannot easily rectify a judicial error.\nQueensland v Commonwealth (Second Territorial Senators case) (1977) 139 CLR 585 provides a good example of the application of stare decisis, as well as examples of its non-observance.\n\nTwo years after the Territorial Senators case, a number of States again sought a declaration that the Territorial Senators legislation was invalid.\nGibbs and Stephen JJ, of the minority in the Territorial Senators case, voted with Mason, Murphy and Jacobs JJ in favour of the legislation, yielding a 5:2 vote in favour of the constitutional validity of Territorial Senators.\nGibbs and Stephen JJ continued to disapprove of the earlier decision, but nevertheless followed its precedent.\n\n\n\n\nImplication\n\nEngineers\n\nImplied meanings could only be construed where such a meaning was necessarily or logically implied from the text of the Constitution. Otherwise judges should not overlay the Constitution with implications which they feel should be there\n\n\nFamous implications have arisen in cases such as\n\nMelbourne Corporation v Commonwealth (1947) 74 CLR 31 regarding the doctrine of implied immunities (see Chapter 8), R v Kirby;\nEx parte Boilermakers Society of Australia (1956) 94 CLR 254 regarding the doctrine of the separation of judicial power\n\n\n\n\nInternational law\n\nNewcrest Mining (WA) v The Commonwealth (1997) 190 CLR 51\n\nTo the full extent that its text permits, Australia’s Constitution, as the fundamental law of government in this country, accommodates itself to international law, including insofar as that law expresses basic rights\nAt common law, judges are required to resolve ambiguities in statutory interpretation in favour of compliance with Australia’s international law obligations.179 In Newcrest Mining, Kirby J extended that rule to apply to constitutional interpretation.\n\nrepeated this view in numerous cases, such as Kartinyeri v Commonwealth (1998) 195 CLR 337 (at 417-418) and\nThomas v Mowbray (2007) 233 CLR 307 (at 440-441)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe consequences of invalidity\n\nWhen a court pronounces governmental action, legislation or decision to be invalid, the act or decision is generally treated as void ab initio\nA finding of constitutional invalidity will mean that the relevant statutory provision is void\n\nHowever, courts will adopt various techniques to try and save as much of a law as possible. One technique is to “read down” a law.\nThe other technique is to “sever” a law\n\n\nPublic Service Association of SA v Industrial Relations Commission of SA (2012) 249 CLR 398\n\nHeydon J described the process of “reading down”\nIf the impugned statute is capable of bearing two meanings, one which would render it invalid and the other which would render it valid, the latter is to be preferred.\n\n\nIf certain provisions of a law, or applications of those provisions, are found to be unconstitutional, the remaining provisions can continue to operate if the offending provision can be “severed”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLecture Notes:\n\nConstitutionalism def\n\nA system where power is limited by a Constitution, whether written or unwritten, consisting of\n\nA foundational law setting out the chain of command and\nFundamental laws or principles that place limits on governmental power\n\n\n\n\nQuestions to start with\n\nWhat is the chain of command in our Constitution\nShould it be easy to change a Constitution\n\nNah\n\n\nWhat if it was written in the late 1800s\n\n\nConstitution Overview:\n\nLegislative Powers of the Commonwealth\n\nThe Commonwealth government can only pass laws that come within heads of power set out in s 51 of the Constitution or another provision of the constitution aka enumerated powers\ns 51 is the main section of parliament power\nMATCH EVERY LAW TO A HEAD OF POWER\nHeads of power covered in this subject\n\ns 51(i) trade and commerce within the context of characterisation\ns 51(vi) the naval and military defence of the Commonwealth and of the several States, and the control of the forces to execute and maintain the laws of the Commonwealth;\ns 51(xix) naturalization and aliens;\ns 51(xx) foreign corporations, and trading or financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth;\ns 51(xxvi) RACE: the people of any race for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws;\ns 51(xxix) external affairs;\n\n\nSections that are different from others\n\nS 51 (xxxi) the acquisition of property on just terms from any State or person for any purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws;\nS 51 (xxxix) matters incidental to the execution of any power vested by this Constitution in the Parliament or in either House thereof, or in the Government of the Commonwealth, or in the Federal Judicature, or in any department or officer of the Commonwealth.\nS 61 -

its rights in Court and enjoying rights under common law and statute.4\ns 61 expressly vests executive power in the Queen, and declares that her powers are exercisable by the Governor-General as her delegate.\n\nUnfashionable to refer to executive as just the crown\n\n\nGovernor-General in Council, defined in s 63 as:\n\n“the Governor-General acting with the advice of the Federal Executive Council”.\nThe Federal Executive Council (FEC) is in turn defined in s 62 as persons “chosen and summoned by the Governor-General”, who “hold office during his pleasure”.\n\nMinisters are members of the FEC, and “hold office during the pleasure of the Governor-General”, so they can constitutionally be sacked by the Governor-General.\n\n\ns 64 authorises the creation of administrative departments supervised by “the Queen’s Ministers of State for the Commonwealth”\n\n\nConstitutional executive members\n\nthe Governor-General, the FEC, the Ministers, Ministerial departments and the armed

public schools.\nArgument: That funding was not authorised by any statute, so it would have to be grounded in an autonomous executive power to spend if it was to be valid.\nHCA stated the power of expenditure via contract “is now a powerful tool of public administration” and rejected the Cth argument\n\na majority rejected the existence of autonomous executive power to spend, even within the bounds of the federal Parliament’s heads of power. The same limit seemed to apply to the power to conclude contracts.\n\n\n\n\nThe High Court majority imposed a similar limit on the Commonwealth’s power to conclude contracts:\n\nthe Commonwealth was not able to conclude a contract for any purpose.\n\n\n\n\nThe relationship between s 61 and common law executive powers\n\nRuddock v Vadarlis (2001) 110 FCR 491,\n\nthe constitutionality of some of

detention centre, while their asylum claims were processed under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) if they had reached Christmas Island.\nThe Australian government refused the Tampa permission to dock in Christmas Island, presumably to avoid this consequence\n\nthe vessel was not permitted to dock on Christmas Island.\nThe rescuees were forcibly removed from the MV Tampa to the HMAS Manoora, and transported to Nauru and New Zealand.\n\n\n\n\nIt was clear that the actions of the SAS were not authorised by statute, so a key question was whether the executive had non-statutory power to do what had been done\nBlack CJ indicates that the existence or non-existence of the power to exclude aliens in the prerogative is decisive of whether such a power exists within inherent executive power.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo autonomous power to detain\n\nChu Kheng Lim v Minister for Immigration (1992) 276 CLR\n\nThe Commonwealth executive has no autonomous powers to detain people within power

detained in a detention centre on Nauru which was funded by the Australian government and staffed by personnel from private entities acting pursuant to an Australian government contract.\nThe majority found that that detention did not contravene the Constitution\nKeane J found that the plaintiff was not detained by the Commonwealth, but by Nauru\nThe High Court’s decision upheld the legality of Australia’s offshore processing regime, confirming the government’s constitutional and legislative authority to detain asylum seekers in third countries as part of its border protection and immigration control measures.\nThis case has significant implications for Australia’s immigration policy and the legal framework governing the treatment of asylum seekers, reinforcing the legal basis for offshore processing and detention practices.\n\n\n\n\nThe nationhood power\n\nNationhood and expenditure\n\nNationhood power def\n\nBestowed by s 61 , and that a legislative nationhood power could

added (at 63-64) that the power to authorise short-term economic measures to combat a global economic downturn which was impacting on Australia’s economy did not equate with “a general power to manage the national economy”.\nThus, the majority in Pape indicated that the federal spending power which exists under s 51(xxxix) in conjunction with s 61 is quite broad.\nThe ratio of the decision is more limited.\nThe joint judges ultimately refused (at 87) to speculate on the outer limits of the nationhood power to spend.\n\n\n\n\nCoercive nationhood power\n\nThe AAP case concerned the nationhood power as an authorisation for government expenditure, and the existence of the machinery to administer that expenditure.\nCommonwealth v Tasmania (Tasmanian Dam case) (1983) 158 CLR\n\nThe Justices in Tasmanian Dam drew a clear distinction between the nationhood power in the field of expenditure, where it was potentially very broad, and in the field of regulatory coercive law, where it was narrow.\nSufficient connection test def\n\nif != validly characterised under the Heads of power, can invoke implied incidental power\ninvoked proportionality\n\n\n\n\nR v Hughes (2000) 202 CLR 5\nReiterated coercive laws may only rarely be authorised by the nationhood power.\nthe Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions was authorised to prosecute persons for violations of Western Australian corporations laws.\nThus, the case did not concern the creation of new offences; it concerned the conduct of prosecution of State offences\nIn the circumstances of the case, the Court was able to find alternative sources for the power of the DPP besides the nationhood power.\n\n\nCommonwealth/ State co- operation\n\nR v Duncan; Ex parte Australian Iron and Steel Pty Ltd (1983) 158 CLR 53\n\nIssue:\n\nthe authority for the establishment of a Tribunal to exercise federal and State powers in preventing and settling interstate disputes in the Coal industry.\nMason J indicated that one of the heads of power which authorised the Commonwealth’s participation in this joint co-operative venture with the States was the nationhood power.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCROWN IMMUNITY\n\nThe Crown (at both Commonwealth and State levels) has a prerogative presumptive immunity from suit.\nFor example, a Crown servant is immune if he or she is sued while acting in his or her capacity as a Crown servant, but not if the servant is sued in his or her individual capacity, or has acted outside his or her authority.\ns 57 and 58 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) remove the common law Crown immunity from the Commonwealth and from the States in respect of “federal jurisdiction”\nThe Crown can also be held to be bound by a statute if such is “necessarily implied” from the Statute.\nA strict test of necessary implication was applied in this regard by the Privy Council in Province of Bombay v Municipal Corporation of Bombay [1947] AC 58;\n\nCrown liability had to be “manifest from the very terms of the statute” or necessary in order to avoid total frustration of the legislative purpose.\nThis rigid test of necessary implication was considerably loosened in Bropho v Western Australia (1990) 171 CLR 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAppropriation and expenditure\n\nAppropriations power\n\ns 81\n\nSection 81 thus guarantees that all moneys collected by the government are stored in Consolidated Revenue to be appropriated for the purposes of the Commonwealth in the manner and subject to the charges and liabilities imposed by this Constitution.\n\n\ns 83\n\nSection 83 ensures that money cannot be drawn from Consolidated Revenue except by an appropriation, authorised “by law”, that is legislation.\n\n\n\n\nThe status quo regarding appropriations after AAP was that appropriations statutes were valid because either:\n\n(a) the Commonwealth was free to determine the purposes for which it could appropriate money; or\n(b) the appropriations Act could not be legally challenged\n\n\nWilkie v Cormann (2017) 91 ALJR 1035; 349 ALR 1\n\nconcerned a challenge to government’s power to appropriate funds to hold a national postal survey on the views of Australians on same sex marriage.\nSection 10 of the Appropriation Act (No 1) 2017-2018 (Cth) allowed advances of up to $295 million to be made to the Finance Minister where the Minister was satisfied there was an “urgent need” for expenditure that was “unforeseen”.\nThe Minister accordingly made the required statement in August 2017 that he believed the appropriation for the survey was “urgent” and “unforeseen”, in order to appropriate $122 million for the survey\nCourt concluded that a “need” is something “which ought to occur” – not something that is “critical or imperative” (at 111). “Urgency” was a “relative concept”.\n\nIf the Minister was satisfied that the expenditure should be made before the next Appropriation Act was due to be passed, “urgency” was made out (at 113).\n\n\nFinally, the interpretation of “unforeseen” was simply “expenditure [that was] unforeseen by the Executive Government” (at 1056).\nWilkie follows Combet in permitting the purposes of appropriations to be only minimally specific, despite Brown v West\n\n\nPower to spend appropriated moneys\n\nLinked legislative power to appropriate and executive power to spend\n\nMurphy and McTiernan JJ linked the power to spend moneys with the legislative power to appropriate.\nAs they found that the Commonwealth could appropriate money for such purposes as it saw fit, they consequently found that the Commonwealth had a similarly broad power to authorise expenditure of that money for those purposes.\nBarwick CJ and Gibbs J also linked the two powers\n\n\nIt appeared after AAP that the Commonwealth had a broad power to authorise the expenditure of appropriated moneys on such purposes as the legislature saw fit.\n\nHowever, as with the Pharmaceutical Benefits case, the AAP case lacked a coherent majority on the scope of the federal government’s power to spend\n\n\nThe federal power of expenditure arose again in Pape v Commissioner of Taxation (2009) 238 CLR\n\nNo member of the Court agreed that ss 81 and/or 83 conferred a power to spend appropriated moneys upon the executive.\n\nThus, the views of McTiernan and Murphy JJ from AAP were rejected\n\n\nTherefore, valid government expenditure must be preceded by a valid appropriation by the legislature\n\n\nThe full ramifications of Pape were exposed in Williams v Commonwealth (2012) 248 CLR 156, which confirmed significant and hitherto unanticipated restrictions on the federal government’s power to spend money.\n\nThe majority found that spending by the executive must generally be authorised by federal legislation under a federal head of power.\n\n\nHowever, the executive has autonomous powers to spend money under s 64 of the Constitution, as well as, possibly, the nationhood power.\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 2: Characterisation and the Implied Incidental Power\n\nThe modern Approach to Direct Characterization\n\nFairfax v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1965) 114 CLR\n\nCharacterization is determined by reference solely to the operation which the enactment has if it be valid, that is to say by reference to the nature of the rights, duties, powers and privileges which it changes, regulates, or abolishes.\nIssues over taxation vs investment and if the law was telling people how to invest\n\none could argue that the law imposed a duty to pay tax or invest in public securities.\n\n\nThe Fairfax approach to characterisation, focusing solely on the direct rather than consequential effect of laws, permits the Commonwealth to enact laws which have significant effects on areas outside its heads of power.\n\nCth has tax Head of Power, so that makes the whole law Ok under Dual Characterization\n\n\n\n\nSouth Australia v Commonwealth (First Uniform Tax case) (1942) 65 CLR 37\n\nCharacterization asks What does the law do in the way of changing or creating or destroying duties or rights or powers?” The consequential effects are irrelevant for this purpose.\n\n\nMurphyores Incorporated Pty Ltd v Commonwealth (1976) 136 CLR\n\na leading case which again demonstrates that the policy behind a law, and the indirect consequences of a law, are generally irrelevant for the purposes of characterising that law.\nThe case concerned characterisation under s 51(i), which gives the Commonwealth power with regard to, inter alia, international trade.\n\nIt anticipated that such an inquiry would find that the proposed mining would be detrimental to the ecology of Fraser Island, and would therefore prompt the Minister to deny export approval to Murphyores.\nMurphyores also sought a declaration that the Minister could not take into account “non-Commonwealth” considerations, such as environmental impact, when exercising his power of exports approval.\nIt was plainly a law about export, a type of international trade and commerce, and thus clearly at the heart of s 51(i).\nIt did not matter that reg 9 was being manipulated so as to impact on the environmental arena\n\n\nThe High Court unanimously found that the Minister could indeed exercise an unfettered discretion in deciding whether or not to permit mineral exports\n\n\n\n\nIncidental Characterization\n\nEven if a law is not directly a head of power, it can be characterized as an incidental exercise of that head if reasonably connected to a head of power.\n\nIncidental exercises of power may be described as laws which lie outside the core or heart of a head of power, and extend out to the “periphery” of a head of power.\nIncidental Characterization Test\n\nDoes the provision deals with a matter that “directly affects” the subject [matter of a head of power] or is “conducive” to it or whether it is “an appropriate means” or “reasonably necessary” to the effectuation of a purpose within power\n\n\nGrannall v Marrickville Margarine Pty Ltd (1955) 93 CLR 55\n\nThe High Court has also confirmed that each head of power in s 51 authorises the exercise of implied incidental power.\n\n\nSubject Matter Power def\n\nThe scope of these powers is determined by the nature of the subject matter itself, rather than by an overarching purpose.\npowers that are defined by the subject matter they cover, rather than by a specific purpose.\n\nexternal affairs\nRace power\nNationhood power\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 51(i) and incidental power\n\nThe “direct” subject matter of s 51(i) is trade and commerce between two or more States, or between Australia and at least one other nation.\n\n“Trade and commerce” has been interpreted in a common sense lay fashion\n\n\nW &amp; A McArthur Ltd v Queensland (1920) 28 CLR 530,\n\nthe High Court confirmed that it includes all commercial dealings with goods and services, such as commercial arrangements, mutual communings, negotiations, bargaining, transport and delivery.\n\n\nO’Sullivan v Noarlunga Meats (1954) 92 CLR 565\n\nconcerned the validity of the Commerce (Meat Export) Regulations (Cth).\n\nNoarlunga was required to register its premises under both the Commonwealth regulations and a State statute.\nNoarlunga argued that the State Act was inconsistent with the Commonwealth regulations, so it did not have to obtain the State licence.\n\n\nRegulation 5 of the Commonwealth regulations provided for the registration of premises used for the “slaughtering of meat for export”.\n\nThe slaughtering of meat is a step in the production of meat, and is therefore outside the ambit of interstate or international trade in that meat.\nTherefore, reg 5 could only be valid under s 51(i) as an exercise of incidental power.\nA High Court majority found that reg 5 could be so characterised.\n\nThe clear connection between the regulation of “slaughter for export” and “export” itself sufficed to render reg 5 within incidental power under s 51(i)\n\n\n\n\nNoarlunga Meats provides an example of “vertical integration” between international trade and intrastate activities.\nWhere intrastate activities are steps in a process which leads in virtually all circumstances towards international (or interstate) trade, it is likely that the Commonwealth can control those activities under its incidental power in s 51(i)\nHorizontal integration refers to the idea that the intrastate and interstate/international elements of a certain type of trade might be so intermingled that it is necessary for the Commonwealth to regulate all trading activities in order to meaningfully regulate interstate and international trade.\n\n\n\n\nSection 51(i) reads:\n\nThe Parliament shall … have power … with respect to … trade and commerce with other countries, and among the States.\nSwift Australian Co Pty Ltd v Boyd-Parkinson (1962) 108 CLR 189, Swift ran a poultry farm, and had failed to obtain a licence for the slaughter of poultry for human consumption as required under a Queensland Act.\n\nthis time the slaughter of “poultry for export” was not an objectively different process from the slaughter of poultry for home consumption.\nThe High Court majority disagreed, and found that reg 5 was only intended to regulate the slaughter of poultry for export.\n\n\nAirlines of New South Wales Pty Ltd v New South Wales (No 2) (1965) 113 CLR 5\n\nthe High Court majority determined an instance where the Commonwealth could regulate intrastate trade due to the commingling of all types of trade.\nThe High Court majority held both regs 198 and 199 to be valid exercises of incidental power under s 51(i)\n\nKitto J (at 115) stated that intrastate trade, such as intrastate flights, could be regulated under s 51(i) where “the law, by what it does in relation to intrastate activities, protects against danger of physical interference the very activity itself which is within Federal power”.\n\n\nThe ultimate result of the case was that airline operators within New South Wales had to obtain both a State and a Commonwealth licence if they wished to engage in intrastate flights operations.\n\nAs in Swift v Boyd- Parkinson, the Court’s refusal to allow regulation of intrastate activities under s 51(i) caused great inconvenience\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 51(ii) and incidental power\n\nSection 51(ii) states:\n\nThe Parliament shall … have power … with respect to … taxation; but so as not to discriminate between States or parts of States.\n\n\nGriffin v Constantine (1954) 91 CLR 13\n\na tax was imposed on potable spirits, such as gin and whisky\nConstantine was charged under s 16 of the Spirits Act 1906-1952, which prohibited the sale of industrial spirits for human consumption;\nSection 16 was clearly not enacted directly under the tax power, as it imposed no duties with regard to taxation at all.\n\nThe High Court found s 16 to be a valid exercise of incidental power under s 51(ii\n\n\nThe Court found that the potable spirits tax would be thwarted if industrial spirits could be sold for human consumption.\n\n\nVictoria v Commonwealth (Second Uniform Tax case) (1957) 99 CLR 575\n\n\n\n\nRelevance of Proportionality; Purposive Powers\n\nProportionality def refers to the idea that “there should be a reasonable relationship or balance between an end and the means used to achieve that end”\n\nTest of proportionality test - Defence Power Test\n\nlaw must fall within the incidental aspect of a legislative power, asking whether the law constituted a reasonably appropriate method of furthering the subject matter contained in the core of the power.\nThe effect of the laws will be valid as long as they bear some rational connection to the power\n\n\nBurton v Honan (1952) 86 CLR 169 at 179, denied the relevance of issues of “justice, fairness, morality, or propriety” in questions of characterisation, direct or incidental:\n\n“those are not matters for the judiciary to decide upon”.\n\n\nIn Burton, the Court unanimously found that s 262 of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth), which provided for the automatic forfeiture of goods imported in breach of customs law, to be valid.\n\nSection 262 was incidental to the appropriate enforcement of customs laws, which were themselves clearly laws regarding international trade and commerce under s 51(i).\nIt did not matter that the law in this case deprived an innocent person, Burton, of a car that he had purchased in good faith; “fairness” was not a relevant issue\n\n\n\n\nPurposive power\n\n\nLeask v Commonwealth (1996) 187 CLR 579\n\n\nIssue with law requiring reporting of transactions of over 10k AUD\n\n\nThe Court stated that proportionality was an irrelevant issue with regard to direct characterisation under most heads of power.\n\n\nIn Leask, the High Court majority agreed that proportionality was relevant when considering direct or incidental exercises of power under purposive powers.\n\nTest\n\nDetermining the validity of a law under a purposive power it’s necessary to investigate whether the law is appropriate and adapted to the power’s purpose.\n\n\nconceded that proportionality could be a relevant factor in deciding whether a law had a sufficient connection to a Commonwealth power so as to constitute an incidental exercise of power.\n\n\n\nPurposive power def\n\nSome Commonwealth heads of power have been found to be “purposive” in that they describe a specific purpose, such as s 51(vi), the defence power\nEvery grant of power conferred by the Constitution, s 51 extends to the making of laws in relation to matters necessary to achieve the main purpose or purposes of that power:\n\nNationwide News Pty Ltd v Wills (1992) 177 CLR 1, McHugh J at 100.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian Communist Party v Commonwealth (Communist Party case) (1951) 83 CLR 1,\n\nthe Court examined the validity of the Communist Party Dissolution Act 1950 (Cth)\nThe Act dissolved the Communist party under security concerns\nThe majority found that the Act could not be characterised as being for the defence of the nation.\n\nThere was insufficient available evidence, beyond the opinion of the legislature and the executive, to classify the need to combat communism as a subject matter capable of coming within s 51(vi).\nIn other words, it was disproportionate to the purpose of defending the nation to dissolve the ACP and confer discretion upon the Governor-General to dissolve affiliated organisations, and prejudice the civil rights of individuals against whom he made declarations under s\nThe Court conceded that the exercise of power in the Communist Party Dissolution Act may have been permissible if Australia had been “on a war footing”\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas v Mowbray (2007) 233 CLR 30\n\nConcerned the constitutional validity of legislation which provided for the issuance of “control orders”.\nControl orders def mandate a number of restrictions on the activities of a person\n\nUsed to prevent terrorists or people who have received terrorist training\n\n\nHouse arrest and police parol for Jack Thomas.\nThe majority found that it could be characterised under the defence power.\n\nThe majority found that that power was not limited to wars against foreign nations and external threats, or to “waging war in a conventional sense”, or to protection of the body politic compared to the general public:\nthe power could be used to authorise measures to combat terrorism\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProportionality and incidental power\n\nIn McCloy v New South Wales (2015) 257 CLR 178 the majority (French CJ, Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ) stated (at 195) that proportionality analysis applies to “incidental powers, which must serve the purposes of the substantive powers to which they are incidental\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 3: First Nations People and the Constitution and the Race Power\n\nIndigenous people and the Constitution\n\nSovereignty Issues\n\nThe Indigenous peoples of Australia never ceded sovereignty to the British.\nAt the time of colonisation (and indeed at and since Federation), no treaties or negotiated agreements were made between the Indigenous peoples and the\nCooper v Stuart (1889) 14 App Cas 286 at 29\n\nHistorical case

193\n\nthe plaintiff sought to argue, on behalf of the Wiradjuri people, that the Wiradjuri were a sovereign nation of people, and alternatively that they were a “domestic dependent nation”4 entitled to self-government and full rights to their traditional lands.\n\n\nIn Walker v New South Wales (1994) 182 CLR 45 the Chief Justice again reiterated his view of the sovereignty argument\nThe Chief Justice’s judgments in these post-Mabo cases suggested that any recognition of independent or concurrent sovereignty of Indigenous Australians is not likely to be successfully argued before the Australian High Court.\n\n\nConstitutional provisions regarding Indigenous people at Federation\n\nSection 51(xxvi) provided that the Commonwealth had power to make laws with respect to:\n\nthe people of any race, other than the aboriginal race in any State, for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws. [emphasis added\n\n\nThe second provision was s 127, which stated:\n\nIn reckoning the numbers of people of the Commonwealth, or of a State or other part of the Commonwealth, aboriginal natives shall not be counted.\nFunding purpose due to Indigenous people being held to be so inferior that they were not to expect the same level of government expenditure or political participatory rights as non- Indigenous Australians.\n\n\n\n\nThe 1967 referendum\n\nIn 1958, the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders (FCAATSI) was formed with the aim of campaigning for repeal of discriminatory legislation, and to “amend the federal Constitution to give the Commonwealth Government power to legislate for aborigines as for other citizens”\nThe amendment simply empowered the Commonwealth to enact “special laws” for Indigenous people, but it did not require the Commonwealth to pass those laws\n\nRemoved “other than the aboriginal race in any state” clause of race power to make laws about aboriginal people\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Race power\n\nthe race power def\n\nPower derived from s 51(xxvi)\nThe contemporary issue regarding the race power is whether the Commonwealth has plenary power over the people of any race\nIn Commonwealth v Tasmania (Tasmanian Dam case) (1983) 158 CLR\n\nObiter\n\nMurphy, Brennan and Deane JJ indicated that the power could only support the enactment of laws which benefited a particular race, while\nGibbs CJ indicated that the race power was plenary, and could therefore support beneficial and detrimental laws\nElements elaborated\n\nThe meaning of race\n\nBrennan J:\n\nCommon history, religion spiritual beliefs, culture, bio origins, and physical similarities\n\n\nDeane J:\n\nAll that majes up personality and identity of people of a race\n\n\n\n\nThe meaning of special laws\n\nInvolved s 8(1) of the World Heritage Porperties Conservation At which specifically stated it was a section enacted as a special law for the people of the Aboriginal race\nThe law preserved archaeological relics\nMason, Murphy, Brennan, and Deane JJ would only support the enactment of laws whcih benefited a particular race - originates from this case\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWestern Australia v Commonwealth (Native Title Act case) (1995) 183 CLR 373\n\nall of the Justices agreed that the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) had been validly enacted under s 51(xxvi)\nThey also found that the Act was for the benefit of Indigenous Australians\n\n\n\n\nThe scope of the race power was considered again in Kartinyeri v Commonwealth (Hindmarsh Island case) (1998) 195 CLR 33\n\nBackground\n\nThe South Australian Government approved a proposal for a tourist facility and a bridge from the South Australian mainland to Hindmarsh Island in 1994.\nA group of local Indigenous women sought a declaration under s 9 or s 10 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 (Cth) (the Heritage Protection Act) to halt the bridge construction, claiming that it would desecrate sacred sites.\nUnder ss 9 and 10, the responsible Minister was empowered to make emergency and other declarations containing “provisions for and in relation to the protection and preservation” of areas which are “significant Aboriginal area[s]”\nMinister made a declaration protecting the site, and preventing the bridge from being built.\n\nA number of legal challenges were brought against the declaration, and the Federal Court found that the reporting process was defective.\n\n\nThe Kartinyeri case itself concerned a challenge to the validity of the Bridge Act.\n\nThe only substantive provision of the Bridge Act is s 4\n\n\nThe effect of the Act was thus to remove the bridge construction site from the potential protection of the Heritage Protection Act, thus ensuring the construction of the bridge despite any consequent harm to Indigenous heritage within the area\nThe question before the High Court was whether the Bridge Act was validly enacted pursuant to s 51(xxvi) of the Constitution.\n\nThe plaintiffs were Indigenous women belonging to the Ngarrindjeri people, whose heritage they claimed was threatened by the bridge construction.\n\n\n\n\nCounsel for Plaintiffs argument\n\nThe Act here did distinguish within a racial group as the Act’s detriment was felt by only one Indigenous group, the Ngarrindjeri.\nSecond, it was argued that any law enacted under the race power had to be for the benefit or advancement of people of any race, or at least not detrimental to these people.\n\ndeprived the plaintiffs of rights they might otherwise have been able to enjoy under the Heritage Protection Act.\n\n\n\n\nNo majority, however, emerged with regard to the scope of the race power.\n\nGaudron, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ all delivered statements on the scope of s 51(xxvi)\n\n\nGaudron, Gummow, Hayne and Kirby JJ rejected the first argument, that s 51(xxvi) does not authorise laws which distinguish or discriminate between members of a racial group, finding that s 51(xxvi) can support a law with respect to a sub-group of a particular race\n\nsplit on the issue of whether s 51(xxvi) only authorises laws for the benefit of the people of a race or, in the alternative, for the benefit of the people of the Indigenous race.\nGummow and Hayne JJ therefore found that s 51(xxvi) permits all laws which single out a specific race, apart, perhaps, from laws which are so prejudicial and irrational as to amount to a “manifest abuse” of public trust.\nGaudron J agreed that the 1967 referendum did not alter the character of s 51(xxvi) so as to restrict Parliament’s power\n\n\nS 51(xxvi) race power conditions\n\nThe criterion for the exercise of power under s 51(xxvi) is that it be deemed necessary –not expedient or appropriate\n\nGaudron J\n\n\nFor whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws\n\nthere must be some difference pertaining to the people of the race involved or their circumstances or, at least, some material upon which the Parliament might reasonably form a political judgment that there is a difference of that kind\nConditions\n\ns 51(xxvi) does not authorise special laws affecting rights and obligations in areas in which there is no relevant differences between those affected by the law and people of other races\nthe law must be reasonably capable of being viewed as appropriate and adapted to the difference asserted.\n\n\n\n\nGaudron J found that only laws directed towards remedying disadvantage were likely to be authorised by s 51(xxvi)\n\n\nNo express Consitutitonal guarantee of equality before the law\n\nKatinyeri v The Commonwealth (1998) 195 CLR 337\nThe CW has the power to pass laws which discriminate against classes

snap back at the end of a period of international conflict to its limited peacetime scope.\n\n\nAndrews v Howell (1941) 65 CLR 255\n\nCourt upheld the validity of the National Security (Apple and Pear Acquisition) Regulations (Cth).\n\nThe object of the regulations was ‘to minimize the disorganization in the marketing of apples and pears likely to result from the impracticability of exporting sufficient quantities … because of the effects upon shipping of the present war’\n\n\n\n\nStenhouse v Coleman (1944) 69 CLR 457\n\nthe Court upheld regulations conferring on the Minister a wide discretionary power to make orders controlling the sale or distribution of ‘essential articles’, provided that his actual orders had ‘[464] a real connection’ with defence.\n\n\nThemes\n\nThe Defence Power’s scope depends on Australia’s defence needs at any given time and, as these needs fluctuate, so does the scope of the power.\nThis is a purposive power, and can be legislated around a specific

essential materials, in particular kerosene and thanite’\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCold War: The Communist Party Case\n\nThe major decisions of the decade after World War II were Australian Communist Party v Commonwealth (Communist Party Case) (1951) 83 CLR 1 and Marcus Clark &amp; Co Ltd v Commonwealth (Capital Issues Case) (1952) 87 CLR 177.\nCold War led to Communist Party Dissolution Act 1950 (Cth)\n\nSection 4 of the Act declared the Communist Party to be an unlawful association, provided for its dissolution and enabled the appointment of a receiver to manage its property.\nSection 5 empowered the Governor-General to declare other organisations unlawful\nOnce unlawful, an association would be dissolved under s 6 and a receiver appointed under s 8.\nUnder s 9(2), the Governor-General could declare any person to be a ‘Communist’ or member of the Party by exercising a similar discretion to that given by s 5(2)\n\nBy 6:1 (Latham CJ dissenting), the High Court held that the Act was invalid\n\n\n\n\nAustralian Communist Party v Commonwealth (Communist Party Case) (1951) 83 CLR 1\n\nThe Commonwealth maintained that the Act was valid on two alternative grounds:\n\nthe defence power, and\n‘the other power’.\n\nAKA Nationhood power\n\n\n\n\nMaterial Facts:\n\nThe Act sought to dissolve the Australian Communist Party and associated entities, declaring them unlawful and enabling the executive to prohibit organizations and individuals deemed prejudicial to Australia’s defense.\n\n\nIssues Raised:\n\nWhether the Act was constitutional\nThe extent of Parliament’s power to legislate based on defense and national security\n\n\nLaws/Statutes in Contention:\n\nthe defense power (s 51(vi)) and the implied nationhood power\n\n\nPrecedences:\n\nReference to prior cases concerning the defense power and executive discretion, including Farey v Burvett (1916) and others highlighting the limits and applications of defense-related legislation.\n\n\nDefence Power Analysis:\n\nThe court’s analysis revolved around whether the Act’s provisions could be justified as a necessary and appropriate exercise of the Commonwealth’s defence power, especially given the Act’s broad and unreviewable executive discretion to proscribe organizations and individuals deemed prejudicial to Australia’s defence.\n\n\nWords and Phrases Considered:\n\n“Defence power”, “nationhood power”, “unreviewable discretion”, “privilegium”\n\n\nJudicial Opinions and Interpretation:\n\nThe High Court ultimately found the Act invalid, emphasizing the importance of judicial review over facts stated in legislative recitals and the limits of Parliament’s power to legislate based on defense and national security without adequate judicial oversight.\nThe justices critiqued the Act for granting the executive unreviewable discretion to ban organizations and individuals and for directly targeting the Australian Communist Party without a clear and permissible connection to the enumerated defense power.\n\n\nTests Applied:\n\nThe Court implicitly applied a proportionality and necessity test to determine whether the Act’s measures were appropriate and adapted to achieving a defence-related purpose within the bounds of the Constitution.\n\n\nRatio Decidendi:\n\nThe decision underscored that legislative actions taken under the defence power must have a clear, direct, and constitutionally permissible purpose related to the defence of the Commonwealth.\nLegislation that broadly targets individuals or organizations without a direct and necessary link to defence purposes exceeds the scope of the defence power.\n\n\nConclusion and Relevance to Modern Law:\n\nThis case is a landmark decision reinforcing the principles of judicial review, the separation of powers, and the limits of legislative and executive authority under the Australian Constitution.\nIt underscores the necessity for legislative and executive actions to have a clear and permissible basis within the scope of constitutional powers, particularly in matters of national security and defense.\nThe decision continues to influence Australian constitutional law, serving as a critical reference point for evaluating the balance between national security and the protection of individual rights and freedoms\n\n\n\n\nMarcus Clark &amp; Co Ltd v Commonwealth (Capital Issues Case) (1952) 87 CLR 177\n\nConcerned the Defence Preparations Act 1951 (Cth).\nLike the Communist Party Dissolution Act, it was prefaced with a series of recitals – for example, that ‘a state of international emergency’ existed ‘in which it is essential that preparations for defence should be immediately made’. Section 4 authorised the\nGovernor-General to ‘make regulations for or in relation to defence preparations’\n\nCommunist Party Dissolution Act compared to Capital Issues Regulations\n\nUnlike the Communist Party Dissolution Act, the Capital Issues Regulations had made elaborate provision for judicial review of the Treasurer’s decision\n\nTreasurer must justify decision\nevaluated by courts\nOnly affected economic rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe case acknowledges that situations falling short of actual war can expand the scope of the defence power, allowing legislation on matters not explicitly related to naval and military defence.\n\n\n\n\nTerrorism and National Security\nBefore the terrorist attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001, Australia had no national laws specifically directed at the prevention of terrorism.\nStenhouse v Coleman (1944) 69 CLR 45\n\nDixon J\n\nin ascertaining the factual circumstances relevant to the validity of legislation under s 51(vi), ‘[469] the court must depend upon matters of general public knowledge’, since ‘ordinarily the court does not go beyond matters of which it may take judicial notice’.\n\n\n\n\nCommunist Party Case,\n\nwhen Fullagar J drew his famous contrast between the ‘primary’ aspect of the defence power\n\n(covering things that can be undertaken in peace and war, such as ‘[254] the provision of ships and munitions’)\n\n\nand its ‘secondary’ aspect\n\n(covering things that can be undertaken only in time of war, such as ‘[254] the rationing of goods’),\n\n\nhe maintained that it was only in relation to ‘[255] this secondary or extended aspect of the power’ that Dixon J had said in Andrews v Howell (1941) 65 CLR 225 that ‘[278] its application depends upon facts’\nFullagar J explained that what were at stake in the ‘primary’ or ‘central’ aspect of the defence power were laws ‘[253] which have, as their direct and immediate object, the naval and military defence of the Commonwealth’\n\n\nThomas v Mowbray (2007) 233 CLR 307\n\nContrasted precedant (Such as Communist Party Case)\nHeld that the legislative power given by s 51(vi) is not confined to the defence of Australia against external aggression, but extends to defence against terrorist acts committed inside Australia, regardless of the perpetrators’ origin.\nBackground\n\nThe case involved an ‘interim control order’ imposed on Joseph (Jack) Thomas by a Federal Magistrate under Pt 5.3, Div 104, Subdiv B of the Criminal Code (Cth).\nThe order required Thomas to remain in his home between midnight and 5am each day and report to police three times a week\n\n\nIssue Raised:\n\nWhether the defence power in section 51(vi) of the Constitution extends to the enactment of laws for the imposition of control orders to protect against internal terrorist threats.\n\n\nLegislation\n\nAccording to s 104.4(1) of the Code, the order could be made only if ‘the court is satisfied on the balance of probabilities’ of two criteria.\n\nThe first criterion was either ‘that making the order would substantially assist in preventing a terrorist act’ or ‘that the person has provided training to, or received training from, a listed terrorist organisation’.\nThe second criterion was ‘that each of the obligations, prohibitions and restrictions to be imposed on the person by the order is reasonably necessary, and reasonably appropriate and adapted, for the purpose of protecting the public from a terrorist act’.\n\n‘Terrorist act’ is defined in s 100.1 of the Code to mean any of a wide range of actual or threatened actions (including, but not limited to, those causing death or physical harm to a person or serious damage to property) undertaken with ‘the intention of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause’, and also with the further intention of ‘coercing, or influencing by intimidation’, an Australian or foreign government, or of ‘intimidating the public’ or a section thereof.\n\n\nMajority held 6:1 (kirby J dissent)\n\nthe purpose ascribed to ‘control orders’ was itself the very kind of purpose envisaged by the grant of legislative power in s 51(vi).\n\n\n\n\nRatio Decidendi:\n\nThe High Court’s decision established that the defence power includes legislative actions to prevent and respond to terrorism within Australia, expanding the interpretation of section 51(vi) of the Constitution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 4: External Affairs Power\n\nExtraterritorial Power\n\nExtraterritorial Power location\n\nSection 51(xxix) of the Constitution confers power on the Commonwealth Parliament with respect to “external affairs”\nJurisdiction\n\nextraterritorial power,\nlegislative power regarding relations with other nations and,\nmost controversially, power to implement treaty provisions.\nArguably, it also includes a separate power regarding matters of “international concern”\n\n\narises when a Parliament legislates with respect to acts or matters beyond its borders\nPresumption that there was no colonial extraterritorial power was overturned\n\nCroft v Dunphy [1933] AC 156\n\n(concerning the powers of the Canadian federal Parliament),\n\n\nMillar v Commissioner of Stamp Duties (1932) 48 CLR 618 and\n\nconcerning the legislative power of New South Wales\n\n\nBroken Hill South Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1937) 56 CLR 337\n\nconcerning the legislative power of New South Wales.\n\n\n\n\nCurrent HCA Nexus between legislation and matter being regulated\n\nUnion Steamship Co of Australia Pty Ltd v King (1988) 166 CLR 1 at 14\n\nthe requirement for a relevant connection between the circumstances on which the legislation operates and the State should be liberally applied and that even a remote and general connection between the subject- matter of the legislation and the State will suffice\nthe Court indicated that the extraterritorial power of States may be limited where the exercise of such powers interferes unduly with zthe legislative powers of another State\n\nAka Federal Limit\n\n\n\n\nFederal Limit on State power\n\nMobil Oil v Victoria (2002) 211 CLR 1\nclass action against Mobil regarding its manufacture and sale of allegedly defective aeroplane fuel\nclass action provisions in Victoria extended beyond the State’s territorial competence, as it provided for causes of action within Victorian Courts by non-Victorians concerning transactions outside Victoria.\n\nGleeson CJ expressed the limit as one which prevented one State from exercising legislative power “which destroys or weakens the legislative authority of another State or its capacity to function as a government” (at 26).\n\n\n\n\n\n\ns 3 of the Statute of Westminster 1931 (UK) confirmed that all Commonwealth dominions, including the Commonwealth of Australia, had extraterritorial power.\nNew South Wales v Commonwealth (Seas and Submerged Lands case) (1975) 135 CLR 337,\n\nthe High Court had to consider the validity of legislation vesting sovereignty in respect of the territorial sea, and sovereign rights in respect of the natural resources in Australia’s continental shelf, in the Commonwealth\nThe whole Court found that s 51(xxix) permitted the Commonwealth to exercise power with respect to “matters or things geographically situated outside Australia”\n\n\nPolyukhovich v Commonwealth (1991) 172 CLR 501.\n\nwhether s 51(xxix) conferred plenary extraterritorial power (matters outside australia)\nMason CJ, Deane, Dawson and McHugh JJ confirmed that s 51(xxix) gave the Commonwealth plenary extraterritorial power, so there was no nexus requirement\n\nGaudron J decided that a nexus was necessary, but the very decision of the Commonwealth to legislate upon a matter was conclusive evidence of such a nexus.\nThe practical effect of her judgment is essentially no different from that of the majority, as she renders the issue of nexus virtually non-justiciable\nBrennan and Toohey JJ interpreted s 51(xxix) more narrowly, so as to only give the Commonwealth power over matters with a genuine connection to Australia.\n\n\n\n\nXYZ v Commonwealth (2006) 227 CLR 532\nthe validity of ss 50BA and 50BC of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) was tested.\nThese provisions enable the prosecution in Australia of Australian citizens, or residents, if they commit certain sexual offences against children under 16 years of age in other countries.\nThe plaintiff had been charged under the Act for alleged sexual relations with a person under 16 in Thailand.\nThe majority (Gleeson CJ, Gummow Hayne and Crennan JJ) in XYZ endorsed the Polyukhovich principle that s 51(xxix) granted plenary extraterritorial power, thus enabling the Commonwealth to legislate for any offence overseas\n\n\n\n\nRelations with other Countries\n\nUnder s 51(xxix), the Commonwealth may legislate with respect to relations with foreign nations\n\nR v Sharkey (1949) 79 CLR 121,\n\nthe creation of the offence of “sedition”, which prohibited the excitement of disaffection against the governments of the United Kingdom or any of the King’s Dominions, was a valid exercise of power under s 51(xxix\n\n\nIn Koowarta v Bjelke- Petersen (1982) 153 CLR 168, Brennan J (at 258) endorsed the extension of the Sharkey principle to cover laws regarding relations with other “international persons”, such as the United Nations and other intergovernmental organisations\nThomas v Mowbray (2007) 233 CLR 307 partially concerned the definition of “terrorist acts” for the purposes of federal law,\n\nThree judges found that the application of anti-terrorism laws, in particular provisions regarding control orders,20 to terrorist threats in other countries fell within the part of s 51(xxix) that concerns Australia’s relations with other countries\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplementation of treaties\n\nRatification of Treaties\n\nThe Commonwealth executive has inherent prerogative power to ratify international treaties\n\nAn agreement between an Australian State and another country has the status of an international contract, rather than an international treaty.\n\n\nConsequences of Ratifiying Treaties\n\nFirst, it signals that Australia is bound in international law to follow that treaty’s provisions\nSecond, ratification may render administrative decision-makers liable to take those treaty provisions into account when making decisions.\nThird, it gives the Commonwealth Parliament power to legislate to implement that treaty\n\n\n\n\nThe effect of international treaties on Australian Law\n\nWhen Australia ratifies a treaty and becomes a party to it, Australia is bound in international law to obey the terms of that treaty.\nA ratified treaty does not, however, become enforceable in Australian domestic law unless it is specifically incorporated into Australian law by an Act of Parliament.\nPlaintiff S195/2016 v Minister of Immigration and Border Protection (2017) 261 CLR 622\n\nthe unanimous Court said neither “the legislative nor the executive power of the Commonwealth is constitutionally limited by any need to conform to international law” (at 186)\n\n\nJudges must attempt to interpret statutes in a way that conforms to Australia’s international law obligations\n\nChu Kheng Lim (1992) 176 CLR 1\ntreaties can be used as an aid to interpret Commonwealth legislation?\n\n\nMinister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh (1995) 183 CLR 273,\n\nfurther expanded the utility of unincorporated treaties in Australian law.\nTeoh was a convicted drug dealer who was denied permanent residence by the Minister for Immigration\nHis imminent deportation would have breached the rights of his children under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), which has not been specifically incorporated into Australian law.\n\nThe High Court set aside the order on the basis that the Minister’s decision had not taken into account Teoh’s legitimate expectation that his residency application would be treated in a manner consistent with Australia’s CRC obligations.\nThe Teoh decision therefore indicated that unincorporated treaties have a procedural effect in Australian law; their existence impacted on the procedures to be followed in the case of administrative decisions which did not comply with their provisions\n\n\n\n\nRe Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Lam (2003) 214 CLR 1\n\na case which did not require consideration of Teoh on its facts, three members of the five- man High Court (McHugh, Gummow and Callinan JJ) expressed dissatisfaction with the Teoh precedent, indicating that it is vulnerable to being overturned if it should be challenged before the Court.\nEx parte def\n\nex parte decision or order is a legal action taken by a court at the request of and for the benefit of one party only, without requiring the presence or participation of any opposing party.\nEx parte proceedings are typically reserved for urgent situations where giving notice to the other party is not possible or could result in irreparable harm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncorporation of treaties into domestic law\n\nTreaties therefore have only limited effect on Australian domestic law unless they are incorporated into that law by the passage of a statute.\nIn the early 1980s, it was finally established that the Commonwealth Parliament has the power to incorporate Australia’s treaty obligations under s 51(xxix)\n\nR v Burgess; Ex parte Henry (1936) 55 CLR 608\nHCA split over this issue\nLatham CJ, McTiernan and Evatt JJ supported the view in obiter that the Commonwealth had power to incorporate all of its treaty obligations under s 51(xxix).\nIn contrast, Dixon and Starke JJ adopted a narrow view, suggesting that such power only existed where the subject matter of the treaty was one of “sufficient international significance” (Starke J at 658)\nS51(xxix) not limited to Commonwealth enumerated\npowers (matters covered by s51)\nMcTiernan and Evatt - the right to enter treaties was unlimited.\n\nParliament may also legislate to carry out recommendations and draft conventions agreed upon by international organisations\n\n\nKoowarta v Bjelke-Petersen (1982) 153 CLR 168\n\nThe decisive judgment in Koowarta was that of Stephen J, who found that the Commonwealth, under s 51(xxix), could implement a treaty when it related to a matter of “international concern”\n\n\nCommonwealth v Tasmania (Tasmanian Dam case) (1983) 158 CLR 1\n\na clear majority of Mason, Murphy, Deane and Brennan JJ confirmed that s 51(xxix) granted the Commonwealth the legislative power to incorporate all of its treaty obligations into Australian law.\nThe minority in Tasmanian Dam adopted Stephen J’s approach from Koowarta, that is that the relevant treaty could only be incorporated into domestic law under s 51(xxix) if it concerned a matter of international concern.\n\n\nThe thin majority in Tasmanian Dam in favour of the Koowarta broad interpretation of the scope of s 51(xxix) was converted into unanimous acceptance in Richardson v Forestry Commission (1988) 164 CLR 26\n\nnow accepted that the Commonwealth can implement all of its treaty obligations regardless of their subject matter under s 51(xxix)\n\n\n\n\nTreaty ratification must be bona fide\n\nA number of High Court Justices have indicated that the Commonwealth can only implement treaties which have been entered into in good faith\nGibbs CJ correctly suggests in Koowarta (at 200) that the “doctrine of bona fides would at best be a frail shield available in rare cases”\n\n\nThe need for a treaty “obligation”\n\nTasmanian Dam, Gibbs CJ (at 106)\n\nGibbs CJ was indicating that the Commonwealth cannot use s 51(xxix) to implement treaty provisions which impose no actual obligation on States’ parties.\n\n\nRichardson v Forestry Commission (1988) 164 CLR 261\n\nwhich once more concerned the validity of Commonwealth legislation designed to protect heritage sites in accordance with the World Heritage Convention.\nThe Court unanimously found that the Convention imposed an obligation to identify such areas, so the establishment of the Inquiry to undertake the task of such identification was a valid exercise of the power under s 51(xxix) to implement treaty obligations\nWilson J in Richardson commented (at 300) that the concept of obligation appeared to be relaxed, indicating that the Justices will not read the words of a treaty pedantically in order to establish the existence of an obligation\n\n\n\n\nSpecificity Principle def\n\nVictoria v Commonwealth (ILO case) (1996) 187 CLR 416\n\nconcerned Commonwealth legislation which, in part, incorporated various Conventions and Recommendations of the International Labour Organization\nThe ILO majority indicated that a treaty must be reasonably specific as to what States are expected to do.\nThe cited example of an obligation to “promote full employment” can arguably be achieved in a large number of ways, as there is no consensus (domestic or international) as to how full employment is best achieved.\n\nA large amount of discretion is conferred if the treaty does not provide a sufficiently specific regime to guide the State party in its treaty implementation, and the goals of the treaty are such that there is no real consensus over how to achieve them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConformity Principle def\n\nThe “conformity principle” arises with regard to the nature of the implementing legislation.\n\nThe implementing legislation must conform to the requirements of the treaty.\nVictoria v Commonwealth (ILO case) (1996) 187 CLR 416\n\nDeficiency in implementation of a supporting Convention is not necessarily fatal to the validity of a law; but a law will be held invalid if the deficiency is so substantial as to deny the law the character of a measure implementing the Convention or it is a deficiency which, when coupled with other provisions of the law, make it substantially inconsistent with the Convention.\nRecommendations can be supported only if appropriate and adapted to giving effect to the terms of the Conventions to which they relate\n\n\n\n\nAlqudsi v Commonwealth (2015) 91 NSWLR 92,\n\nLeeming JA, with whom McCallum JA agreed, spent some time reconciling the inconsistent passages in the ILO case and came to the conclusion that the Commonwealth is not authorised under s 51(xxix) to implement the recommendations of international agencies, unless those instruments give effect to treaties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatters of International Concern Minority Justices\n\nadopted Stephen J’s view from Koowarta, and found that only treaties that related to matters of international concern could be implemented under s 51(xxix)\nIn Tasmanian Dam, all Justices agreed that the Commonwealth has power to implement legislation with regard to “matters of international concern”.\nHowever, the Justices differed greatly as to the meaning they gave to “matters of international concern”.\n\nthe majority endorsed the view that the Commonwealth could implement any treaty obligation, regardless of subject matter.\nminority Justices adopted Stephen J’s view from Koowarta, and found that only treaties that related to matters of international concern could be implemented under s 51(xxix)\n\nThe majority agreed that the Commonwealth could implement s 51(xxix) laws regarding matters of “international concern”, but adopted a broader definition thereof.\n\n\nPape v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (2009) 238 CLR 1,\n\nHeydon J again expressed scepticism over the existence of a separate “international concern” component to s 51(xxix).\n\n\n\n\nIn Alqudsi v Commonwealth (2015) 91 NSWLR 92, Leeming JA, with whom McCallum JA agreed, reviewed High Court dicta on the matter and concluded (at 122):\n\nThe absence of a principled basis for the doctrine, the weight of High Court authority against it … lead me to conclude, respectfully, that there is no separate aspect of the external affairs power based on “international concern”.\nno recognised federal legislative power within s 51(xxix) based simply on the notion of international concern.\n\n\n\n\nCustomary International Law\n\nCustomary international laws def\n\nare binding international norms arising from the “general and consistent practice of states [state practice] followed by them from a sense of legal obligation [‘opinio juris’]\nAustralia’s obligations under customary law do not automatically become part of Australian law unless they are specifically incorporated by legislation.\n\n\nNulyarimma v Thompson (1999) 96 FCR 15\n\nclaimants contended that certain acts by government Ministers, such as the implementation of policies which extinguished native title, constituted genocide.\nThe Federal Court had to consider whether genocide, an international crime prohibited by customary international law, was a crime in Australia in the absence of specific legislation.\n\nIn Nulyarimma, only Merkel J found that norms of customary international law automatically became part of Australian common law.\nThe majority (Whitlam and Wilcox Polyukhovich JJ) found that customary international criminal laws had to be incorporated by legislation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 5: Corporations Power\n\nSection 51(xx) states:\nThe Parliament shall, subject to this constitution, have power to make laws with respect to … Foreign Corporations, and trading or financial Corporations, formed within the limits of the Commonwealth\nFrom Huddart Parker to Concrete Pipes\n\nHistory\n\nThe corporations power lay virtually dormant for 60 years, by way of the High Court’s initially limited interpretation in Huddart, Parker and Co Pty Ltd v Moorehead (1909) 8 CLR 330\nrevived in Strickland v Rocla Concrete Pipes (Concrete Pipes case) (1971) 124 CLR 46\nThe High Court finally confirmed the enormous scope of the corporations power in the case that challenged that legislation, New South Wales v Commonwealth (Work Choices case) (2006) 229 CLR 1\n\n\nThe power\n\na class of legal persons, particular types of corporate entities, rather than a certain type of activity, such as “taxation” or “trade and commerce”, or a purpose, such as “defence”.\n\n\nHuddart, Parker and Co Pty Ltd v Moorehead (1909) 8 CLR 33\n\nHuddart Parker was a company formed under Victorian law.\n\nfined five pounds for refusing to answer certain questions in relation to suspected offences under ss 5 and 8 of the Australian Industries Preservation Act 1906 (Cth)\n\n\nThe sections of the Act which imposed the fines prohibited foreign, trading or financial corporations from engaging in agreements in restraint of trade, or from forming trade monopolies, in relation to all trade and commerce within the Commonwealth.\n\nThe majority felt that s 51(xx) should not be interpreted so as to invade the field of State law over domestic trade.\nIsaacs J wrote a forceful dissent, finding that s 51(xx) permitted the Commonwealth to regulate the conduct of corporations in their “transactions that affected the public”, a far wider view than the majority adopted.\n\n\nThe Huddart Parker interpretation of s 51(xx) left the Commonwealth with little power to regulate corporate activities.\n\n\nStrickland v Rocla Concrete Pipes Ltd (1971) 124 CLR 468\n\ninvolved a challenge to certain provisions in the Trade Practices Act 1965 (Cth).\n\nThose provisions made certain anti-competitive agreements subject to examination (s 35) by requiring corporations to provide the particulars of all such restrictive trade agreements to the Commonwealth Commissioner of Trade Practices (ss 41-43).\nRocla was a party to an agreement which sought to reduce competition between concrete pipe manufacturers.\n\n\nThe High Court unanimously overturned Huddart Parker. Barwick CJ explained (at 488) that the Court’s reliance on the old reserved powers doctrine had “emasculate[d] the legislative power given by s 51(xx)”\n\nReserved powers enacted by the Engineers case\nThe Commonwealth could not be prevented from regulating constitutional corporations on the basis that “their trading activities in intrastate trade was a matter for the State legislation exclusively” (at 488).\n\n\nIn short, the Court gave a wider reading to the scope of the corporations power, but the Trade Practices Act in its 1965 version reached out to corporations beyond those listed in s 51(xx)\n\nThe Commonwealth gained significant regulatory power over economic activity if such activity was carried out by a trading, financial or foreign corporation.\nFurthermore, the case confirmed that the corporations power could be used to regulate intrastate trade and commerce insofar as it was carried out by a constitutional corporation\n\n\nthe Court expressly declined to define the scope or the limits of the corporations power, saying (at 490) that the “law develops case by case”\n\n\n\n\nConstitutional corporations\n\nThe Constitution identifies three types of corporations:\n\nforeign,\ntrading\nfinancial.\n\n\nThe last two must be “formed within the limits of the Commonwealth”.\n\nCorporations that are not within these three categories are beyond the direct scope of s 51(xx\n\n\nForeign corporations\n\nForegin corporation def\n\nany entity formed under the law of a foreign country and accorded a corporate legal personality either by the foreign law, or by Australian law, will be a foreign corporation\nif a corporation is incorporated in another country, then it can be regulated under the corporations power, even if the corporation is not a trading corporation or a financial corporation\nGoverned by Work Choices case\n\n\n\n\nTrading corporations\n\nR v Trade Practices Tribunal; Ex parte St George County Council (1974) 130 CLR 53\n\na majority of 3:2 in the High Court decided that a local government entity, which sold electricity and electrical appliances, was not a trading corporation.\nMenzies and Gibbs JJ determined this by examining the “purposes” for which the company was established\n\nlocal government corporation rather than trading corp\nA trading corporation def was therefore, for these two Justices, identifiable by the purposes for which it was established\n\n\nBarwick CJ stated (at 543) that the test of identifying a trading corporation was to inquire as to whether its predominant and characteristic activity was that of trading in goods or services\nCASE WAS REPUDIATED IN R v Judges of Federal Court and Adamson\n\n\nR v Judges of Federal Court and Adamson; Ex parte Western Australian National Football League and West Perth Football Club (1979) 143 CLR 19\n\na majority of four Justices found that the St George County Council case was wrongly decided\nwhether the South Australian and Western Australian football leagues and the West Perth football club were trading corporations, for the purposes of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth)\nThe High Court held by a majority of 4:3 that the leagues and the club were trading corporations within the meaning in s 51(xx), and so within the reach of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).\nBarwick CJ, with Mason and Jacobs JJ, said that when determining if a corporation was a “trading corporation”, the prime consideration was the activities or functions of that corporation, rather than the purposes of incorporation.\n\nAka current activities test\n\n\nSports head of power justification\n\ncorporations power\n\nfrom this case - sports are a trading corporation\n\n\ntrade and commerce\nNationhood power\nNot studied - communications power\n\n\n\n\nCommonwealth v Tasmania (Tasmanian Dam case) (1983) 158 CLR\n\nA number of issues regarding the corporations power were raised in the Tasmanian Dam case, one of which was the identification of the HEC as a trading corporation.\nThe HEC was responsible for the generation and distribution of electricity in Tasmania.\nIts functions included supply of electricity, and the construction, operation and maintenance of the generating plants and dams.\nThe majority, made up of Mason, Murphy, Brennan and Deane JJ, held that the HEC was a trading corporation, because its trade in electricity made up “a sufficiently significant proportion” of its overall activities.\nprevailing interpretation is that the Court now applies the current activities test.\n\n\n\n\nFinancial corporations\n\nIn Re Ku-ring- gai Co-operative Building Society (No 12) Ltd (1978) 36 FLR 13\nDeane J described “financial activities def” (at 642)\n\n“financial activities” are distinguished from trading activities in that the former transactions involve only money and the generation (or loss) of money, whereas the latter concern dealings in goods and services.\nOBLIGATION ON EACH SIDE IS MONEY\n\n\nState Superannuation Board v Trade Practices Commission (1982) 150 CLR 282,\n\nthe High Court examined whether the State Superannuation Board of Victoria (SSB) was a financial corporation within the ambit of the corporations power, and thus susceptible to the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).\napplied the current activities test as expressed in Adamson’s case, and found that the Board’s “financial activities” were substantial enough to warrant its classification as a “financial corporation”.\nendorsed Deane J’s definition of “financial transactions” in the Ku- ring- gai Co- operative case.\n\nmost “financial corporations”, under the prevailing High Court definition, are also “trading corporations\n\n\n\n\nFencott v Muller (1983) 152 CLR 570,\n\nthe High Court had to decide whether a “shelf company” could be regulated as a “trading or financial corporation”.\nThe Adamson “activities” test is clearly inappropriate for a company that does not engage in much, if any, activity at all\n\nThe majority of the High Court (Mason, Murphy, Brennan and Deane JJ) found that Oakland Nominees Pty Ltd, a “shelf company”, could nevertheless be a trading or financial company absent any current activities (at 601-602)\n\ntrading and financial activities were specified as objects within the corporation’s capacities, and therefore as “purposes” for which it had been set up\n\n\n\n\nPurpose test for shelf company, activities test for others\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScope of Corporations Power\n\nContext of Corporations Power (s 51(xx)):\n\nThe scope of the Commonwealth’s power to legislate with respect to corporations under Section 51(xx) of the Constitution has been a subject of judicial interpretation, particularly in determining the extent to which this power can regulate the actions of natural persons and entities other than corporations themselves.\n\n\nActors Equity v Fontana Films [No citation provided]\n\nIncidental Aspect of Corporations Power:\nBrennan J’s interpretation suggests a law falls outside the incidental scope of s 51(xx) if it holds an organisation accountable for actions it hasn’t directly engaged in or supported.\nConversely, Gibbs CJ and Wilson J found the incidental aspect could support laws requiring unions to prevent member conduct harmful to a corporation, showcasing a wide interpretation of incidental powers but a narrow view on the core corporations power.\nNarrow view of Corporations power:\n\nSufficient connection test\nView in this case\n\n\nBroad view\n\nAfter workchoices - broad plenary power\n\n\n\n\nFencott v Muller (1983) 152 CLR 570\n\nImposition of Duties on Natural Persons:\n\nUpheld the validity of imposing duties on natural persons under s 82(1) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 as incidental to regulating corporate activities.\nThe Court’s rationale was corporations act through individuals, and effective regulation necessitates duties on those individuals participating in corporate activities.\n\n\n\n\nRe Dingjan; Ex parte Wagner (1995) 183 CLR 323\n\nSufficiency of Connection to Corporations Power:\n\nChallenged sections of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 were found outside the corporations power, emphasizing a law must have a significant effect on a constitutional corporation to be valid under s 51(xx).\n\n\n\n\nNew South Wales v Commonwealth (Work Choices Case) (2006) 229 CLR 1\n\nProcedural History:\n\nThe case tested the validity of amendments to the Workplace Relations Act 1996 made by the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005.\n\n\nOriginal Dispute:\n\nDispute over the Commonwealth’s power to introduce a national industrial relations system, previously a shared competency with states, without relying on s 51(xxxv) (industrial disputes power).\n\n\nCurrent Reason for Trial:\n\nTo determine if the Work Choices amendments, underpinned by the corporations power (s 51(xx)), were constitutionally valid.\n\n\nMaterial Facts:\n\nThe Work Choices amendments extended Commonwealth industrial relations laws to cover a broader range of employment relations, specifically targeting constitutional corporations and their employees.\n\n\nIssue:\n\nWhether the Work Choices amendments were validly supported by the corporations power (s 51(xx)) of the Constitution.\n\n\nLaws/Statutes in Contention:\n\nWorkplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth), as amended by the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005.\n\n\nPrecedences:\n\nReference to previous interpretations of s 51(xx) regarding the corporations power’s scope.\n\n\nTest\n\nThe ‘object of command’ test – if a law is directed at a constitutional corporation,the law will be valid, no matter what activities the law is directed towards\n\ni.e. it can regulate any activities of that corporation\n\n\n\n\nJudicial Opinions and Interpretation:\n\nMajority Opinion: Endorsed the broad “object of command” interpretation of the corporations power, allowing for extensive regulation of constitutional corporations and their activities, including employment relations.\nMinority (Dissenting) Opinion: Preferred a narrower interpretation, with Kirby J and Callinan J arguing for restrictions on the Commonwealth’s power based on the historical context and the specific provisions of s 51(xxxv).\n\n\nLegal Reasoning:\n\nThe majority rejected the “distinctive character test” and instead applied the “object of command” test, affirming the broad scope of the corporations power.\nDismissed concerns about the federal balance of powers and the reserved powers doctrine, emphasizing the constitutional legitimacy of the Work Choices amendments.\n\n\nRatio Decidendi:\n\nThe corporations power (s 51(xx)) supports the validity of laws regulating the employment relationships between constitutional corporations and their employees, even beyond trading or financial activities, under the “object of command” test.\n\n\nResult:\n\nThe Work Choices legislation was upheld in its entirety, confirming a broad interpretation of the corporations power and its application to industrial relations.\n\n\nRelevance to Modern Law:\n\nThe decision significantly expanded the Commonwealth’s legislative power over industrial relations, emphasizing the capacity to regulate employment conditions and relations through the corporations power, independent of s 51(xxxv).\nThis case has profound implications for federal-state relations and the scope of Commonwealth legislative authority in areas traditionally managed by the states.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe broad interpretation of the corporations power confirmed in the Work Choices case represents a significant shift, potentially allowing the Commonwealth to legislate in areas traditionally reserved for the States.\nThe decisions in these cases illustrate the evolving understanding of the corporations power and its implications for the balance of power between the Commonwealth and the States.\n\n\nImplications for Modern Law:\n\nThese cases collectively contribute to a broadened understanding of the Commonwealth’s legislative capabilities under the corporations power, with significant implications for federalism in Australia.\nThe Work Choices decision, in particular, has paved the way for expansive Commonwealth intervention in areas affecting corporations, prompting debates on the appropriate balance of legislative authority in Australia’s federal system.\nCorporations power is held in broad view as a plenary power\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 6: Separation of Judicial Power\n\nThe separation of the judiciary from the legislature and the executive, the political arms of government, is designed to ensure that the judiciary is independent of political pressure, and therefore that cases can be decided in a fair and impartial manner.\n\nJudicial power def\n\nderived from the judgment of Griffith CJ in Huddart Parker and Co v Moorehead (1909) 8 CLR 330 (at 357):\nthe power which every sovereign must of necessity have to decide controversies between its subjects, or between itself and its subjects, whether the rights relate to life, liberty or property.\n\n\nFive functions which are quintessentially judicial in nature;\n\ndeclaring the common law,\n\nThe High Court plays a key role in this system because the precedents it sets bind every other court in the Australian judicial system.\nFarah Constructions v Say-Dee (2007) 230 CLR 8\n\nlower courts are bound by “seriously considered dicta” of the High Court\n\n\n\n\nadjudicating and punishing criminal guilt\n\nAustralian Communications and Media Authority v Today FM (2015) 255 CLR 35\nDuncan v NSW (2015) 255 CLR 388\n\nconcerned a challenge to New South Wales legislation which cancelled three mining licences, and which included a legislative declaration that Parliament was satisfied that the original award of the licences had been “tainted by serious corruption”.\n\n\n\n\ndeciding constitutional validity\n\njudicial review of executive action def\n\nthe courts’ role to decide whether an executive decision-maker has exceeded the legal limits of its authority.\n\n\n\n\nreviewing the lawfulness of administrative action\nascertaining the meaning of statutes\n\n\nEnforceability\n\nThe strongest indicator of judicial power is that judicial findings are binding and enforceable.\nBrandy v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (1995) 183 CLR 245,\n\nthe Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) (now renamed the Australian Human Rights Commission) was given the power to register its decisions under anti-discrimination legislation with the Federal Court\n\n\nAttorney General (Cth) v Alinta (2008) 233 CLR 542, the argument was put that the power of the Takeovers Panel to make a declaration of unacceptable circumstances in relation to breaches of the takeovers provisions of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) was a judicial power.\n\n\nBinding and conclusive decisions\n\nRola Company (Australia) Pty Ltd v Commonwealth (1944) 69 CLR 185,\n\nthe majority denied that the determination of facts was an attribute exclusive to judicial power.\n\n\nOn the other hand, denial of a right of court review regarding questions of fact from a Taxation Board of Appeal in British Imperial Oil Co v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1925) 35 CLR 422 was held to effectively vest judicial power in that Board.\n\nSince Rola, it is uncertain whether an administrative finding of fact can be final and conclusive.\nIf so, it paves the way for conceptual confusion due to the consequent need to draw a sharp divide between questions of fact and law\n\n\n\n\nBreadth or nature of discretion to be exercised\n\nR v Spicer; Ex parte Australian Builders’ Labourers’ Federation (1957) 100 CLR 277\n\nthe High Court found that the jurisdiction conferred under s 140 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 (Cth) on the Commonwealth Industrial Court was a non- judicial function\nUnder s 140, the Court could disallow any industrial organisation’s rule upon its own motion if it considered the rule to be “tyrannical or oppressive” or “unreasonable”.\n\n\nDespite the Spicer cases, numerous subsequent decisions have upheld the conferral of broad discretionary jurisdiction upon courts\n\nThe Spicer doctrine has been more successfully argued in the reverse situation:\n\nthat the conferral of seemingly judicial power upon a non-judicial body is in fact permitted due to the breadth of discretion granted.\n\n\nthe breadth of discretion conferred upon the Trade Practices Tribunal (TPT) in R v Trade Practices Tribunal; Ex parte Tasmanian Breweries Pty Ltd (1970) 123 CLR 361 (that is, the power to declare agreements “contrary to the public interest”) helped identify its powers as non- judicial.\n\nTakeovers Panel took account of a broad range of economic issues in regulating takeovers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecisions regarding existing rights and duties\n\nThe nature of the “right” at issue is important in identifying an exercise of judicial or non-judicial power.\n\nIn R v Quinn; Ex parte Consolidated Foods (1977) 138 CLR 1,\n\nthe Court held that the power vested in the Registrar for Trademarks (a non-judicial body) to cancel trademarks on the basis of existing statutory rights was not necessarily judicial.\ndismissed the argument that the deregistration of trademarks was historically a judicial function\n\n\nThe “rights” concerned were not traditional legal rights, but special statutory rights created by the Parliament.\n\nThe Parliament, as the creator of those rights, was found to be free to confer the power to remove those rights on any body, either judicial or non-judicial.\nThe legislation at hand was thus found to concern the investiture of “innominate” statutory powers, which could be classified as either judicial or non- judicial\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeparation of judicial powers – Commonwealth\n\nThe doctrine of separation of judicial powers at the Commonwealth level\n\nCth may only confer judicial power on so-called Chapter III courts, those courts described in s 71 of the Constitutio\nThe Commonwealth may not confer non-judicial power on Chapter III courts.\n\n\nPrinciple 1: Judicial power may only be exercised by Chapter III courts\n\nNSW v Commonwealth (Wheat case) (1915) 20 CLR 54\n\nconcerned the powers of the federal Interstate Commission, created under s 101 of the Constitution\nThe Commonwealth Parliament vested the Interstate Commission with a mixture of non-judicial and judicial powers, the latter including the power to hear and determine complaints, to grant injunctions, to grant declarations, and to penalise people for disobedience of its orders.\nInterstate Commission ruled against NSW, but NSW appealed to HCA\n\nA High Court majority agreed that the Commission had no power to issue such an order., and set aside the order.\n\n\n\n\nupheld in Waterside Workers’ Federation v J W Alexander (1918) 25 CLR 434,\n\nwhere the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, despite its nomenclature, was held not to be a Chapter III court as its President did not have life tenure.\n\n\n\n\nPrinciple 2: Federal courts may not exercise non-judicial power\n\nR v Kirby; Ex parte Boilermakers Society of Australia (Boilermakers case) (1956) 94 CLR 254,\n\nthe powers of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration were again at issue\nIn Boilermakers, the High Court was asked to consider whether the simultaneous vesting of judicial and non-judicial power in the one body was a breach of Ch III.\n\nThe majority found that the investiture of such a mixture of powers was indeed a breach of the constitutional doctrine of the separation of powers\n\n\nThe High Court and Privy Council ultimately found that the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration was essentially an arbitral tribunal, and thus a non-judicial body.\n\nThus, its judicial powers were invalidly conferred.\n\n\n\n\nRe Wakim; Ex parte McNally (1999) 198 CLR 51\n\nthe validity of the cross-vesting scheme, under which State jurisdiction was conferred on the Federal and Family Courts, was challenged.\nIn Wakim, a majority of 5:1 found that State jurisdiction could not be vested in federal courts.\n\nThus, the States are not permitted to vest State judicial power in federal courts, nor can the Commonwealth authorise the reception of such judicial power by federal courts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExceptions TO THE TWO PRINCIPLES\n\nExceptions to principle 1\n\nDelegation of judicial power\n\njudicial power may, within limits, be delegated to non-judicial bodies by Chapter III courts.\nIn Harris v Caladine (1991) 172 CLR 84, the Court found s 37A of the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth) valid.\n\ndelegation of discrete judicial functions by the Family Court to Family Court registrars\nSection 37A did not confer fundamentally important judicial powers upon the registrars.\nConsent orders are made without argument, and require no real adjudication on the part of the registrar.\n\n\n\n\nDiscrete exceptions\n\nSection 49 of the Constitution, which deals with “the powers, privileges and immunities” of the Parliament, authorises the Commonwealth Houses of Parliament to punish for contempt of Parliament, as was confirmed in R v Richards; Ex parte Fitzpatrick and Browne (1955) 92 CLR 157\nR v White; Ex parte Byrnes (1963) 109 CLR 665\n\nthe Court held that public service disciplinary tribunals were permitted to impose punishments for disciplinary offences by Commonwealth public servants.\n\n\nR v Bevan; Ex parte Elias and Gordon (1942) 66 CLR 453, the High Court held that courts martial and other military tribunals could validly exercise judicial power\n\nWhite v Director of Military Prosecutions (2007) 231 CLR 57\n\ncourts martial did not exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth but were, rather, institutions that were essential to maintaining military discipline in a just manner within military structures under the defence power, s 51(vi)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExceptions to principle 2\n\nIncidental powers\n\nIn Boilermakers, the Court outlined one exception to the second limb of the doctrine of separation of judicial power\n\nSection 51(xxxix) extends to furnishing courts with authorities incidental to the performance of the functions derived under or from Chapter III and no doubt to dealing in other ways with matters incidental to the execution of the powers given by the Constitution to the federal judicature.\n\n\nIn R v Joske; Ex parte Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association (1976) 135 CLR 194,\n\ncertain sections of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 (Cth), which conferred broad discretionary powers upon the Industrial Court to rectify or validate the actions of, or to approve schemes to reorganise, trade unions after the Industrial Court had made a judicial decision to invalidate pre-existing rules, were challenged as a breach of the Boilermakers principle\nnon-judicial powers which are incidental to the exercise of judicial power are likely to be at the cusp of the divide between non- judicial and judicial power, which is, as we have seen, itself uncertain\n\n\nIn Wakim, McHugh J noted (at 562-563) that federal courts could exercise “accrued jurisdiction” over State law when the exercise of such jurisdiction was incidental to the determination of federal issues in a case.\n\nThus, federal courts may make determinations under State laws if such determinations are part and parcel of a single justiciable issue involving, in the main, federal jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\nPersona designata exception\n\nThe existence of the “persona designata” exception was confirmed by a slim majority in Hilton v Wells (1985) 157 CLR 5\n\nIn Hilton, the admissibility of certain evidence obtained by phone tapping, as well as the validity of s 20, was challenged on the basis that s 20 authorised the exercise of non-judicial power (the power to issue search warrants) by federal judicial bodies.\nIn essence, the argument was that to confer power on a federal Judge was tantamount to conferring power on a federal court. A majority of 3:2 found that the section was valid.\n\nThe majority, of Gibbs CJ, Wilson and Dawson JJ, found s 20 was valid as the power was conferred upon a Judge in his/her personal capacity, as a “designated person” or “persona designata”, rather than upon a Judge in her or his judicial capacity as a member of the Federal Court.\n\n\n\n\nThe persona designata exception therefore allows the Commonwealth Parliament to confer powers upon single Judges in their personal capacity.\nGrollo v Palmer (1995) 184 CLR 348\n\nagain concerned the validity of telephone interception legislation, which was upheld by a majority of 4:1.\nthe majority outlined a doctrine of incompatibility which limits the persona designata exception\ncannot be vested with powers or functions which undermine or are perceived to undermine their ability to perform their judicial functions.\nIncompatibility principle def\n\njudges should not carry out tasks that conflict with their fundamental responsibilities of adjudicating disputes, interpreting the law, and administering justice.\nThe incompatibility principle was revisited in Wilson v Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Hindmarsh Island case) (1996) 189 CLR 1.\n\nThe federal Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs appointed Mathews J, a Federal Court Judge, to prepare a report under s 10(1)(c) of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 (Cth) on the potential detrimental impact on Indigenous heritage entailed in the construction of a bridge from the mainland to Hindmarsh Island (Kumarangk) which was being planned by the South Australian government, and of the measures the federal Minister should take to preserve any such heritage value (including orders to prevent the building of the bridge).\nA 6:1 majority in the High Court found that her appointment was incompatible with her role as a judge, and was therefore invalid\n\n\nBrennan CJ, Dawson, Toohey, McHugh, and Gummow JJ test for determining whether a non-judicial function was incompatible with a judge’s judicial role\n\nAsk if the non-judicial function is closely connected with the functions of the legislature or the executive.\n\nIf no such close connection is evident, there is no constitutional incompatibility.\n\n\n(2) Must the function be performed independently of the instruction, advice or wishes of the Executive and/or Legislature?\n\nIf the function is not necessarily performed independently, incompatibility arises.\n\n\n(3) Does the function involve a discretion to be exercised on political grounds?\n\nAn alternative way of phrasing the third step is to ask whether a judicial manner of performance is required in the performance of the function.\nIf the answer to the first question on discretion is yes, or the answer to the second question on judicial manner is no, the function is incompatible with a judge’s judicial role, and cannot therefore be conferred upon a judge, even in his/her personal capacity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeparation of judicial powers – State (the Kable principle)\nKable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) (1996) 189 CLR 5\n\nJurisdiction:\n\nHigh Court of Australia - Binding authority in Australia, pivotal for understanding the separation of powers and the independence of the judiciary within the constitutional framework of Australia.\n\n\nProcedural History:\n\nGregory Wayne Kable challenged the Community Protection Act 1994 (NSW), which was enacted to detain him preventively after the completion of his sentence, on the grounds that it was unconstitutional.\n\n\nOriginal Dispute:\n\nConcerned the NSW government’s legislative response to Kable’s impending release from prison, specifically enacted to authorize his continued detention based on assessments of future dangerousness.\n\n\nCurrent Reason for Trial:\n\nAssessment of whether a state law enabling the preventive detention of a named individual infringes upon the principle of separation of powers under the Australian Constitution.\n\n\nMaterial Facts:\n\nKable had been sentenced to imprisonment, and prior to his release, the NSW Parliament passed the Community Protection Act 1994 (NSW), which permitted the Supreme Court of NSW to order his preventive detention beyond his original sentence based on predictions of future harmful behavior.\n\n\nIssue Raised:\n\nWhether the Community Protection Act 1994 (NSW), applying specifically to Kable and allowing for his detention without a new conviction, violated the doctrine of separation of powers by vesting judicial powers in a manner incompatible with the role of the judiciary.\n\n\nLaws/Statutes in Contention:\n\nCommunity Protection Act 1994 (NSW)\nsections of the Australian Constitution relating to the separation of powers and judicial independence.\n\n\nPrecedence:\n\nThis case set a significant precedent regarding the limits of state legislative power, particularly concerning the imposition of detention on individuals beyond their sentence without a new trial or conviction.\n\n\nTests Outlined:\n\nthe court considered the compatibility of the state law with the principles inherent in the Australian Constitution’s structure, particularly the separation of judicial power.\n\n\nWords and Phrases Considered:\n\n“Separation of powers,”\n“judicial independence,”\n“preventive detention.”\n\n\nJudicial Opinions and Interpretation:\n\nThe High Court, by a majority, found the Act unconstitutional because it conferred non-judicial power on the NSW Supreme Court, compromising the court’s institutional integrity and independence.\nThe majority opinion highlighted that the legislation was directed at a specific individual and entrusted the judiciary with an executive function, thereby blurring the lines between the branches of government in a manner incompatible with the Constitution.\n\n\nObiter Dicta:\n\nEmphasis on the importance of maintaining the judiciary’s independence from the legislative and executive branches to uphold the rule of law and protect individual rights.\n\n\nRatio Decidendi:\n\nThe principle that emerged from the decision is that state laws cannot confer powers upon the judiciary that are incompatible with the principles of judicial independence and the separation of powers as established in the Constitution.\n\n\nConclusion and Relevance to Modern Law:\n\nThe Kable decision has had a profound impact on Australian constitutional law, establishing a principle (often referred to as the “Kable principle”) that prevents state legislatures from enacting laws that significantly impair the institutional integrity of courts. This principle has been invoked in various subsequent cases to scrutinize state laws that appear to undermine the separation of powers.\n\n\n\n\nThe Kable Doctrine and Its Implications\n\nOrigin:\n\nThe Kable doctrine originates from Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) (1996), establishing a principle against State laws that confer non-judicial powers on courts in a way that undermines their institutional integrity.\n\n\nKey Principle:\n\nStates cannot confer powers on courts that are incompatible with the judicial role, ensuring the separation of powers and maintaining public confidence in the judiciary’s independence.\n\n\n\n\nJudicial Power and Non-Judicial Bodies\n\nStates have broad powers to legislate but cannot infringe upon the core characteristics of courts, such as independence and impartiality, as these are essential under the Australian Constitution.\nThe case of Fardon and comments by McHugh J highlighted that the Constitution doesn’t explicitly forbid States from empowering non-judicial tribunals with certain judicial capabilities.\n\n\nConstitutional Constraints and Individual Rights\n\nBurns v Corbett (2018) reinforced a limitation on State powers, illustrating that States cannot vest jurisdiction over matters listed in ss 75 and 76 of the Constitution in non-judicial bodies.\nThe Kable case demonstrates Chapter III’s potential to protect individual human rights, emphasizing the doctrine’s role in preventing arbitrary detention and safeguarding liberty.\n\n\nDistinction Between Federal and State Judicial Power\n\nThe separation of powers doctrine at the State level differs from the federal level, with State laws subject to constraints ensuring they do not undermine the defining characteristics of courts.\nWainohu v NSW and subsequent cases have tested and expanded the Kable doctrine, reflecting on the balance between legislative power and judicial integrity.\n\n\nImplications for Legislative Design and Political Accountability\n\nLegislation affecting the judiciary’s role must consider the constitutional implications, especially regarding the judiciary’s independence and the potential for laws to sidestep judicial scrutiny.\nThe discussions in cases like North Australian Aboriginal Justice Agency Ltd v Northern Territory illustrate concerns over legislative schemes that might bypass judicial oversight, emphasizing the need for a balance that respects both legislative intent and judicial integrity.\n\n\nKey Cases Highlighting the Doctrine’s Evolution and Application\n\nInternational Finance Trust, Totani, and Wainohu further explore the boundaries of the Kable doctrine, addressing issues like property rights and freedom of association.\n\nIn International Finance Trust Co v NSW Crime Commission ([2009] HCA 49)\n\nthe High Court found the legislation in question allowed for the making of orders that effectively determined rights without judicial determination, thereby impermissibly undermining the institutional integrity of the courts, consistent with the Kable doctrine.\n\n\nCommissioner of the Australian Federal Police v Pompano Pty Ltd ([2013] HCA 7)\n\nthe legislation provided for a more procedural role for the courts within a framework that respected the court’s function to adjudicate, including safeguards like the requirement for a fair hearing\n\n\nWainohu v New South Wales ([2011] HCA 24),\n\nthe High Court extended the persona designata principle to state judges by holding that the legislation empowering judges to make orders in a non-judicial capacity was invalid, as it compromised the institutional integrity of the judiciary, demonstrating that even when acting as persona designata, state judges cannot be vested with powers that undermine their ability to function independently and impartially within their judicial roles.\n\n\nSouth Australia v Totani ([2010] HCA 39)\n\nthe majority held that the law regarding control orders impaired the institutional integrity of the court by subjecting judicial power to executive direction, essentially compelling courts to act on the basis of executive determinations without sufficient judicial discretion, thereby undermining the courts’ capacity to function as independent and impartial arbiters.\n\n\n\n\nThomas v Mowbray underscores the debate on what constitutes a judicial function and when a legislative grant of power to the judiciary might conflict with constitutional principles.\n\n\nBroader Constitutional Implications\n\nThe ongoing interpretation and application of the Kable doctrine reflect the dynamic nature of constitutional law, responding to evolving legal and societal contexts.\nThe High Court’s role in delineating the boundaries of State and federal powers underlines the significance of judicial review in maintaining the constitutional balance between different branches of government.\n\n\n\nWeek 7: Alien Power\n\nDefining an Alien for the purposes of s51 (xix)\n\nLove v Commonwealth;

Chu Kheng Lim v Minister for Immigration, Local Government &amp; Ethnic Affairs.\n\n\nJudicial Opinions and Interpretation:\n\nMajority: Finds the indefinite detention of the plaintiff unconstitutional as it contravenes Chapter III of the Constitution, overruling the constitutional holding in Al-Kateb.\nMinority: Disagreement on not publishing reasons immediately and requiring further time to consider.\n\n\nLegal Reasoning and Ratio Decidendi:\n\nThe court revisited and overruled Al-Kateb’s constitutional holding, emphasizing that detention must be limited to what is necessary for deportation or visa processing.\nIndefinite detention without a real prospect of removal is punitive and unconstitutional.\n\n\nResult and Relevance to Modern Law:\n\nThe court declared the plaintiff’s detention unlawful since there was no real prospect of his removal from Australia, granting a writ of habeas corpus for his immediate release.\nThis landmark decision highlights the constitutional limits on the power of immigration detention, particularly in cases without a foreseeable prospect of deportation, signaling a significant shift towards protecting individual liberties against indefinite detention.\n\n\nNotes for Examination:\n\nThis case illustrates the High Court’s willingness to revisit and overrule previous constitutional holdings, affirming the principle that detention must be for a legitimate, non-punitive purpose and closely monitored for its necessity and duration. It underscores the judiciary’s role in safeguarding human rights against legislative overreach in the context of immigration law.\n\n\n\n\nAl-Kateb v Godwin [2004] HCA 37, 6 August 2004, A253/2003.\n\nJurisdiction:\n\nHigh Court of Australia\n\n\nProcedural History:\n\nThe appellant, a stateless person, sought a visa to remain in Australia but was denied.\nAfter his request for removal from Australia was not practicable due to the lack of a country willing to accept him, he challenged the legality of his continued mandatory detention under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).\n\n\nOriginal Dispute:\n\nThe appellant, Ahmad Al-Kateb, a stateless individual, was detained under Australian immigration laws after his visa application was denied and subsequent legal challenges failed.\n\n\nReason for Trial:\n\nAl-Kateb challenged the lawfulness of his continued detention given the impossibility of his removal from Australia in the foreseeable future.\n\n\nMaterial Facts:\n\nAl-Kateb, unable to be returned to any country, remained in detention without a clear prospect of release, raising questions about the legality of indefinite detention under the Migration Act.\n\n\nIssue:\n\nWhether the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) authorizes the indefinite detention of a stateless person when there is no reasonable prospect of removal from Australia.\n\n\nLaw/Statute in Contention:\n\nMigration Act 1958 (Cth), particularly sections related to the detention and removal of unlawful non-citizens.\n\n\nPrecedents:\n\nThe case references Chu Kheng Lim v Minister for Immigration, which outlined the constitutional basis for the detention of non-citizens under immigration laws.\n\n\nTests and Their Elements:\n\nExamined the principles surrounding lawful detention under Australian immigration law, focusing on the balance between executive powers and the individual’s rights under common law and the constitution.\n\n\nJudicial Opinions and Interpretation:\n\nThe High Court, in a landmark decision, held that the Migration Act does permit indefinite detention in circumstances where removal is not reasonably practicable, underlining the Act’s interpretation within the bounds of Australia’s constitution.\n\n\nRatio Decidendi:\n\nThe majority opinion established that the Migration Act’s provisions for detention do not require a temporal limit where removal is not feasible, thereby upholding the legality of Al-Kateb’s detention.\n\n\nConclusion and Relevance to Modern Law:\n\nAl-Kateb v Godwin clarified the scope of the Australian government’s authority to detain non-citizens indefinitely under certain conditions, reinforcing the legislative power over immigration matters.\nThis decision has significant implications for immigration policy and the treatment of stateless individuals and asylum seekers in Australia.\nOVERTURNED - see NZYQ v Minister for Immigration\n\n\n\n\nChu Kheng Lim and Others v The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and Another (1992) 176 CLR 1 (Chu Kheng Lim v Minister for Immigration (1992) 176 CLR 1)\n\nJurisdiction:\n\nHigh Court of Australia (Binding)\n\n\nProcedural History:\n\nThis case arises from a challenge to the validity of certain provisions of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), specifically Division 4B, which related to the detention of “designated persons” — primarily asylum seekers arriving by boat without a visa.\n\n\nOriginal Dispute:\n\nThe dispute centered around the legality of detaining asylum seekers, termed “designated persons” under the Act, without the possibility of judicial review of their detention status.\n\n\nReason for Trial:\n\nThe plaintiffs, Cambodian nationals detained as “designated persons” after arriving by boat, sought declarations and injunctions against their detention, arguing that it usurped judicial power and was inconsistent with international obligations under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth).\n\n\nMaterial Facts:\n\nThe plaintiffs were detained under new provisions introduced by the Migration Amendment Act 1992 (Cth), which prevented their release from custody pending determination of their refugee status.\n“Designated Persons def” were defined in s 54K as persons arriving unlawfully in Australia by boat between 19 November 1989 and 1 December 1992\nSection 54R prohibited a court from ordering the release from custody of a designated person.\n\n\n\nIssue:\n\nWhether sections 54L, 54N, and 54R of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), as amended, were invalid on the grounds that they constituted an exercise of judicial power by the legislature and/or violated Australia’s international obligations.\n\n\nLaws/Statutes in Contention:\n\nMigration Act 1958 (Cth), Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth), International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\n\nPrecedents:\n\nThe Court considered previous decisions relating to the judicial power of the Commonwealth and the detention of individuals, including decisions from the United States on similar issues.\n\n\nTests Applied:\n\nThe Court considered whether the legislative scheme for detaining “designated persons” was punitive in nature and whether it improperly usurped judicial functions.\n\n\nJudicial Opinions:\n\nThe High Court was divided, with some justices finding that the scheme was an acceptable non-punitive measure related to immigration control, while others expressed concerns about the separation of powers and the potential for the legislative scheme to be punitive.\n\n\nObiter Dicta:\n\nDiscussions on the nature of judicial power, the rights of non-citizens, and the appropriate limits of executive detention were prominent.\n\n\nLegal Reasoning:\n\nThe majority reasoned that the detention was part of the executive power to control immigration and was not punitive.\nIt was therefore not an exercise of judicial power.\n\n\nRatio Decidendi:\n\nThe Court held that sections 54L and 54N were valid exercises of the legislative power regarding aliens.\nHowever, section 54R, which prevented courts from ordering the release of detainees, was invalid as it was inconsistent with the judicial review inherent in the judicial power of the Commonwealth.\n\n\nResult:\n\nThe Court found most of the challenged provisions valid, with the exception of section 54R, emphasizing the non-punitive intent of immigration detention.\n\n\nRelevance to Modern Law:\n\nThis case remains a key authority on the constitutional limits of immigration detention and the separation of powers in Australia, balancing national security and immigration control against individual rights and judicial oversight.\n\n\n\n\nRe Woolley; Ex parte Applicants M276/2003 by their next friend GS (2004) 225 CLR 1,\n\nwhere the High Court unanimously decided that the mandatory detention of children in immigration detention, if they were unlawful arrivals in Australia, was constitutional.\n\n\nKruger v Commonwealth (Stolen Generation case) (1997) 190 CLR 1\n\nFacts\n\nthe validity of several provisions of the Aboriginals Ordinance 1918 (NT) was challenged\nSection 16 of that Ordinance provided that the Chief Protector (the legal guardian of all Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory) could order the compulsory detention of any Aborigine “or half-caste” on an Aboriginal reserve or within an Aboriginal institution\n\n\nHeld\n\nIt was argued, inter alia, that s 16 invalidly bestowed judicial power on the Chief Protector, plainly a non-judicial body.\nThree of the six sitting Justices found that the doctrine of separation of powers did not apply in the Territories (see [6.175]).\nThe other three Justices, Toohey, Gaudron and Gummow JJ, denied that s 16 conferred judicial power.\n\n\n\n\nPlaintiff M76-2013 v Minister for Immigration, Multicultural Affairs and Citizenship (2013) 251 CLR 32\n\nDetainment elements (lim principle def)\n\nconferring limited legal authority to detain a non-citizen in custody as an incident of the statutory conferral on the executive of powers to consider and grant permission to remain in Australia, and to deport or remove if permission is not granted, is consistent with Ch III if, but only if,\n\nthe detention in custody is limited to such period of time as is reasonably capable of being seen as necessary for the completion of administrative processes directed to those purposes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorthern Australian Aboriginal Justice Agency Ltd v Northern Territory (2015) 256 CLR 569\n\na police officer was empowered to arrest a person without a warrant where the officer believed, on reasonable grounds, that the person had committed, was committing or was about to commit an “infringement notice offence”, which were largely minor public order offences.\nThe joint judges conceded that a punitive purpose might be discerned if the maximum period of detention was “significantly greater” than the four hours specified (at 593).\nGageler J found that non-punitive detention could not extend longer in duration than was necessary to effectuate a statutory purpose capable of fulfilment, and that the duration was capable of objective determination by a court from time to time (at 612)\n\n\nPlaintiff M68/2015 v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection (2016) 257 CLR 42\n\nFacts\n\nconcerned the detention of the plaintiff, a person claiming refugee status, on Nauru pursuant to intergovernmental arrangements between the Australian and Nauruan governments.\nUnder this arrangement, unauthorised maritime arrivals to Australia were transferred to Nauru where they were detained for the purpose of processing their protection claims, unless they returned to their home countries voluntarily.\nThe plaintiff was detained in a detention centre funded by the Australian Government run by a company contracted by the Australian Government and its sub-contractors.\n\n\nHeld\n\nThe joint judges found the requisite authority within s 198AHA of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), which authorised the executive to participate in the detention regime on Nauru for the purposes of facilitating the offshore processing of the claims of alien asylum seeker\nGordon J in dissent found that the law impermissibly authorised punitive detention.\nAs the Commonwealth had funded, caused, procured and effectively controlled the circumstances of the detention. She accordingly found that the “Commonwealth detained the Plaintiff on Nauru” (at 152 and 154)\n\n\n\n\nAlien def\n\nAn “alien” for the purposes of the Australian Constitution refers to a person who is not an Australian citizen, encompassing those who owe allegiance to a foreign sovereign.\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 8: Inconsistency of Laws\n\nWhat is a ‘Law’?\n\nS 109 of constitution\n\nEx parte McLean (1930) 43 CLR 472\n\nDixon J explained (at 484) that inconsistency arises between the Commonwealth statute which empowers the arbitration of an award, and the relevant State provisions, rather than between the award itself and the State law\n\n\nAdministrative orders made under the authority of Commonwealth legislation are not treated as laws for s 109 purposes, and will not override State laws.\nSection 109 prescribes that an inconsistent State law will be “invalid to the extent of the inconsistency”.\nThe inconsistent provisions in a State Act can occasionally be severed for inconsistency (see [1.235]).\n\nHowever, if the provisions are not severable, the whole Act is deemed inoperative ab initio, or from the date that the inconsistency arose.\n\n\nWenn v Attorney-General for Victoria (1948) 77 CLR 84,\n\nwhere the High Court found inconsistency between State and federal legislation regulating employment for returned military personnel.\n\n\nState laws struck down for inconsistency under s 109 may “revive” if the relevant Commonwealth law is repealed.\n\nThe State Parliament is not required to re-enact the dormant law in order to restore its application if the source of the inconsistency is removed or modified.\n\nCarter v Egg and Egg Pulp Marketing Board (Vic) (1942) 66 CLR 557\nButler v Attorney-General (Vic) (1961) 106 CLR 268\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTests for inconsistency\n\nAs a starting point to any inquiry into the matter of inconsistency, it must be established that valid laws are in fact operative on the subject matter in question\nThree principal tests or approaches to inconsistency have evolved over the past century:\n\nthe “simultaneous obedience” test,\nthe “conferral of rights” test\nthe “cover the field” test.\n\n\nthe “simultaneous obedience” test,\n\nThe earliest interpretations of s 109 restricted findings of inconsistency to situations where it was impossible to obey both the State law and the Commonwealth law, which arises when one law commands what the other forbids, or when one law compels disobedience of the other.\n\nR v Licensing Court of Brisbane; Ex parte Daniell (1920) 28 CLR\n\n\nThe simultaneous obedience test arose in McBain v Victoria (2000) 99 FCR 116\n\nThe Victorian Act compelled discrimination on the basis of marital status in relation to access to a service, while such discrimination was prohibited by the Commonwealth Act.\nIt was accordingly impossible for a provider of IVF services to obey both Acts\nREMOVED VIA ENGINEERS V ADELAIDE CASE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConferral of rights\n\nIn Clyde Engineering v Cowburn (1926) 37 CLR 466, Knox CJ and Gavan Duffy J stated (at 478) that two laws will be inconsistent with each other under s 109 when a State law “takes away a right conferred” by the Commonwealth.\n\nThus, a State law will be invalid if it alters, impairs or detracts from the operation of a federal law.\n\n\nColvin v Bradley Bros Pty Ltd (1943) 68 CLR 15\n\nrelevant employers could employ females to work in the industries covered by the award, which included milling machines.\nThe State Factories and Shops Act 1912 (NSW) made it an offence to employ females on such machinery.\nIt was possible to obey both laws, by not employing women on the specified machines. However, the rights conferred on the employers and the prospective female workers were diminished by the State law, so an inconsistency was found\n\n\nMabo and Native title Act case\n\nTraditional usage vs native title\n\n\nAnsett Transport Industries v Wardley (1980) 142 CLR 237 the High Court had to consider the rights conferred by the State and Commonwealth Acts at issue.\n\nFacts\n\nMs Wardley sought employment with Ansett as a trainee pilot but was refused, on the grounds of her gender. Ansett was in clear breach of the Victorian Act, so the Equal Opportunity Board (Vic) ordered the company to employ Wardley.\nAnsett sought a declaration from the High Court to the effect that the State Act was not applicable with regard to the employment or dismissal of the defendant, by reason of inconsistency with the Commonwealth Agreement.\nIt argued that the Victorian law was directly inconsistent with the rights conferred upon it by the federal Agreement as, in Ansett’s view, the Agreement granted it an absolute right to sack employees before they had worked 12 months\n\n\nThe crucial question regarding direct inconsistency in this case was:\n\nwhat right or immunity did the Commonwealth intend to confer? Did the Commonwealth intend to confer upon the airlines an absolute right to dismiss, so long as any relevant procedure in the agreement was followed?\n\n\nThe majority, however, found there was no Commonwealth intention to confer an absolute right to dismiss.\n\nThree Justices in the majority found that the federal Agreement was intended to regulate only the process of dismissing pilots, and conferred no rights on employers regarding the grounds for the dismissal of airline pilots\n\n\n\n\nDirect inconsistency can be eliminated by attributing to the Commonwealth an intention that the rights in the relevant law be read narrowly, or that the law be read so as not to limit the operation of the relevant State law.\nAlternatively, direct inconsistency can be contrived by attributing an intention that the rights conferred by the relevant law be read expansively so as to eject the application of any State law\n\n\nIndirect inconsistency/covering the field\n\nCovering the field test def\n\ninconsistency where the text or the factual operation of the laws does not generate actual conflict\nWhere the Commonwealth has legislated in an area or “field” and intends to “cover” that field, any State legislation in that “field” will be deemed to be inconsistent.\nCovering the field test elements by Isaacs J in Clyde Engineering (at 489- 490):\n\n(a) Identify or characterise the field, or subject matter, that the Common-wealth law deals with and regulates.\n(b) Ascertain whether the State law attempts to regulate a field which the Commonwealth intends to cover.\n\nIf there is no overlap of the fields, then no indirect inconsistency will be found.\n\n\n(c) If the two laws do overlap, ascertain if the Commonwealth intended to cover the field – did the Commonwealth Parliament intend its law to be the only law on the subject matter in question?\n\n\n\n\nIdentification of the “field”\n\nO’Sullivan v Noarlunga Meat (1954) 92 CLR 565 the Commonwealth and State laws at issue dealt with the use of premises for “slaughtering stock for export”\n\nThe High Court in a statutory majority found that both laws concerned the same field, being the regulation of slaughtering stock for export.\nBy considering the wider subject matter of the legislation, the regulation of abattoirs, the Court cast the “fields” as overlapping.\n\n\nFields can be more narrow or less per case which can alter results\n\n\nOverlapping fields: The subject matter approach\n\nAnsett Transport Industries v Wardley (1980) 142 CLR 237 at 251.\n\nOn the indirect inconsistency submission Ansett had argued that the Federal Pilots’ Agreement was intended to “cover the field” regarding the employment conditions of pilots or at the very least the field of the dismissal of pilots.\n\n\nCommercial Radio Coffs Harbour v Fuller (1986) 161 CLR 47\n\nthe Court examined whether there was “cover the field” inconsistency between the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942 (Cth) and the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW)\nThe Commonwealth found that the laws at issue were directed towards quite different purposes, and thus no encroachment into the “fields” could be found.\n\n\nCommonwealth and State laws are less likely to overlap when they concern objectively different subject matters\nAMP Society v Goulden (1986) 160 CLR 330 is a case where the subject matter approach was not taken.\n\n\n\n\nInconsistent criminal laws\n\nSee lecture notes\n\n\nReassessing the tests\n\nsome of the Justices expressly stated there was only one true test of inconsistency – the ascertainment of the Commonwealth’s intention\nOnce direct inconsistency is found, the State law cannot be saved by seeking to demonstrate that the Commonwealth did not intend to cover the field.\n\nOnce s 109 is activated through a direct inconsistency, the lack of an indirect inconsistency is irrelevant.\n\n\nApplication of the first two tests of “direct inconsistency” is normally applied predictably, though Ansett uncovered uncertainties within the “conferral of rights” test. We must doubt, however, whether the cover the field test ultimately is a true “test” with stable indicia producing reliable and consistent outcomes.\n\n\n\nWeek 9: Intergovernmental Immunities\n\nThe doctrine of implied immunities and the Engineers Case\n\nImplied immunities def\n\nIn the early years of Australian federation, the High Court adopted a simple solution: both governments were immune from each other’s legislation.\nRejected by Amalgamated Society of Engineers v Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd (Engineers case) (1920) 28 CLR 129\n\n\nIn cases where the legislation of one government is purporting to bind a member of the executive of the other government, a preliminary issue is whether the legislation at issue has rebutted the common law presumption of Crown (or executive) immunity\n\nEarly Law\n\nD’emden v Pedder (1904) 1 CLR 91, the early High Court found that a Commonwealth officer could not be obliged, under a Tasmanian statute, to pay a tax on his salary.\n\nestablished the principle that the Commonwealth and its officers were impliedly immune from State legislation\n\n\nFederated Amalgamated Government Railway &amp; Tramway Service Association v New South Wales Railway Traffic Employees Association (Railway Servants’ case) (1906) 4 CLR 48\n\nCommonwealth award established under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 (Cth) was held not to bind a New South Wales government instrumentality in its relations with its employees.\n\n\n\n\nAmalgamated Society of Engineers v Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd (Engineers case) (1920) 28 CLR 129\n\nFacts\n\nconcerned industrial proceedings by a trade union, the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, in the Commonwealth Arbitration Court against 843 employers, including three Western Australian government employers.\nUnder the implied doctrine of intergovernmental immunities, those State government employers would have been immune from the jurisdiction of the Court, which had been established under a federal statute, the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 (Cth)\n\n\nHeld\n\nthe Commonwealth heads of power were to be interpreted in accordance with the natural meaning of the words therein.\nLimitations on the scope of those heads of power would not be implied unless such implication followed necessarily or logically from the text.\nThe ratio of the Engineers case clearly authorised the Commonwealth to pass legislation which bound State government instrumentalities.\nObiter statements authorised the exercise of reciprocal power by the States\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommonwealth legislative power of the states (State Banking Case and discriminatory laws)\n\nThe State Banking Case ( Melbourne Corporations Case)\n\nFacts\n\nIn the State Banking case, the impugned law was s 48 of the Banking Act 1945 (Cth), which provided that a bank could not engage in business with a State government, or government authority, without the consent of the federal Treasurer.\nMelbourne Corporation was a local government authority which sought to bank with a private bank, the National Bank of Australasia.\nThe Treasurer would not grant such permission, and urged Melbourne Corporation to switch its banking business to the federally-owned Commonwealth Bank of Australia.\nMelbourne Corporation sought a declaration that s 48 was invalid.\n\n\nHeld\n\nThe High Court agreed\nLatham CJ\n\nfound that s 48 lacked a head of power.\n\nIn particular, he stated that the law was not valid under the banking power, s 51(xiii), as it was essentially a law “with respect to State functions as such” (at 61).\n\n\nHowever, Latham CJ’s arguments seem flawed as, while the law certainly was about the States’ banking activities, it is difficult to deny the law’s character as a law “with respect to banking” under s 51(xiii\n\n\nDixon, Rich, Starke and Williams JJ made up the rest of the majority.\n\nAll of these Justices found that the law could be characterised under s 51(xiii).\nHowever, they found that Commonwealth laws with an intergovernmental impact could be impliedly limited in two instances.\n\n\n\n\nThus, the two specific limits identified in the State Banking case on the Commonwealth’s ability to bind States are that\n\n(a) the Commonwealth may not discriminate against the States, and\n(b) it may not pass laws of general application which fundamentally impede the States from carrying out essential governmental functions.\nlimited rather than blanket immunity would suffice to preserve State autonomy.\n\n\nThis became known as the Melbourne Corporation anti-discrimintion principle def\n\n\nDiscriminatory laws\n\nThe majority in State Banking Case found that s 48 breached the restriction on discriminatory laws, as it clearly singled out the States for special disadvantage by restricting their banking activities.\n\nIn contrast, the law had no effect on the banking activities of any other entity (for example, individuals, corporations) at all.\n\n\nQueensland Electricity Commission v Commonwealth (1985) 159 CLR 19\n\nThe Queensland Electricity Commission (QEC) was established in 1976 by a statute which declared that it represented the Crown in right of Queensland.\nThe Commonwealth government passed the Conciliation and Arbitration (Electricity Industry) Act 1985 (Cth) after major labor disputes, particularly after turbulent issues in Queensland\nHowever, the special rules only applied insofar as they affected the dispute with the Queensland authorities.\n\nHence, the special procedures did not have to be applied to that part of the ongoing s 6(1) dispute involving the electrical authorities of other States.\n\n\nThe QEC and the Electricity Boards challenged the validity of the Act.\n\nThe High Court majority found the Act wholly invalid, on the basis that it discriminated against a State government instrumentality.\n\n\n\n\nIndirect discrimination\n\nIt had been argued on behalf of the Commonwealth that the law impacted on some private electricity suppliers (who generated the remaining 3 per cent of Queensland electricity) in Queensland, so it did not single out the QEC for special treatment.\n\nMason J rejected the argumenT\n\n\n\n\nDiscriminatrion differences\n\nDirect discrimination def arises when one (or in this context a State government entity) is treated differently than other persons (or entities). discrimination can be described as “discrimination in application” or “form”.\nIndirect discrimination def arises when a rule or law is applied neutrally, but impacts disproportionately and detrimentally on a certain group (or State government).\n\nIndirect discrimination is discrimination in substance or effect, rather than form.+\n\n\n\n\n“Rational” discrimination\n\nIn certain circumstances, the Commonwealth is constitutionally authorised to pass legislation which in form and/or effect discriminates against the States or a State.\nDeane and Brennan JJ went on to find in Queensland Electricity Commission in dissent, that s 51(xxxv), the conciliation and arbitration power, did in fact authorise the Commonwealth to impose special dispute resolution provisions on particular existing disputes, such as the one identified in s 6(1), whether the dispute concerned a State government entity or not\n\noutlined an exception to the discrimination prohibition\nBrennan J outlined a simple test:\n\na law may discriminate against a State when it is justified, as in when it is reasonable, to do so.\n\n\n\n\nRichardson v Forestry Commission (1988) 164 CLR 261\n\nthe challenged Commonwealth law prohibited certain activities, such as the felling of trees and excavations, in two forests in Tasmania.\nIt was argued that this law discriminated against the Tasmanian Government, in freezing its use of 4.5 per cent of Tasmania’s land (most of which was Crown land).\nHeld\n\nthe law did not have the anti-federal, impermissible purpose of singling out Tasmania, but instead had the purpose of protecting potential heritage sites which happened to be within Tasmania.\n\n\n\n\nRe Australian Education Union; Ex parte Victoria (1995) 184 CLR 188, the impugned Commonwealth law prescribed a special regime for the resolution of certain types of industrial disputes\n\nFacts\n\nUnder s 111(1)(g) of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 (Cth), the Commonwealth Industrial Relations Commission could refrain from hearing or dismiss a matter on the basis that further proceedings were unnecessary or undesirable in the public interest.\nHowever, s 111(1A) prohibited the Australian Industrial Relations Commission from exercising its power under s 111(1)(g) when dealing with disputes from States where the dispute could not be dealt with by a State arbitrator.\nAt the time, Victoria was the only State where there were disputes that could not be dealt with by a State arbitrator, as the Kennett Government had overseen the abolition of the State conciliation and arbitration system.\n\n\nArgument\n\nCounsel for Victoria argued that s 111(1A) discriminated against Victoria.\n\n\nHeld\n\nMason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ disagreed (at 239-240)\n\nThe discrimination did not seem to be against the Victorian government per se, but against parties to an industrial dispute in Victoria.\nThe legislation in its ongoing operation could not be said to have had a disproportionate impact on the Victorian public sector as opposed to the Victorian private sector, unlike the legislation in Queensland Electricity Commission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTEST: Impairment or curtailment of State’s capacity to function\n\nDiffernet views on implied prohibition\n\nGibbs CJ (at 206) spoke of an implied prohibition on Commonwealth laws that “would prevent a State from continuing to function and exist as such”.\nMason J (at 217) spoke of a prohibition on laws which operated “to destroy or curtail the continued existence of the States or their capacity to function as governments”.\nWilson J (at 226) described the prohibition as one which preserved the structural integrity of the States.\nDeane J (at 247) aptly described the prohibition’s purpose as preserving the continued capacity of the States to function as independent entities\nCompiled in Re Australian Education Union; Ex parte Victoria (1995) 184 CLR 188, the six-Justice majority described the prohibition (at 228) as one which prohibits “an impairment or curtailment of the capacity of a State to function as a government”.\n\n\nThe prohibition was endorsed by the majority in Victoria v Commonwealth (Payroll Tax case) (1971) 122 CLR 353.\n\nIt was argued that the imposition by the Commonwealth of a 2.5 per cent payroll tax on all employers breached this prohibition insofar as it bound State governments.\nThe Court disagreed.\n\n\nWestern Australia v Commonwealth (Native Title Act case) (1995) 183 CLR 373, the State of Western Australia challenged the validity of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth)\n\nOne argument was that the statute impermissibly hampered the capacity of States to govern, as it interfered with the States’ capacity to control the use of land by requiring the States to pay compensation for future diminutions or extinguishments of Aboriginal native title rights.\nThe Court rejected the argument, and gave some clues to the sorts of laws that would breach this prohibition (481)\n\n\nFortescue Metals Group v Commonwealth (2013) 250 CLR 548\n\nthe plaintiff alleged that the federal mining profits tax interfered impermissibly with the States’ control over their natural resources.\nThe States are deemed to own the raw minerals buried in the ground within their borders.\nimposed a tax on mining profits after those profits reached a certain level.\nMining companies could claim allowances, which reduced the assessable amount of profit, against State royalties paid.\nThis “immunities” argument was rejected.\n\n\nThe prohibition was not applied to invalidate a Commonwealth law until 1995 in Re Australian Education Union; Ex parte Victoria.\n\nFirst, counsel attempted to distinguish between a State’s “governmental” functions, which were said to be immune from any interference, and trading functions, which were not immune.\nSecond, an attempt was made to draw a distinction between a State’s administrative staff and its other staff, with the former being immune from Commonwealth legislation.\n\nCourt found the distinction too obscure to support, and that any such distinction was not sustainable on the basis of preserving a State’s capacity to function as a government.\n\n\nHeld\n\n2 major areas of immunity\n\n\n\nthat the Commonwealth cannot interfere with a State’s right to choose who to hire, and a State’s right to fire someone on the grounds of redundancy.\n\n\n\n\nthe employment conditions of people in the higher echelons of State Government (senior state public servants)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAustin v Commonwealth (2003) 215 CLR

the\nSuperannuation Contributions Tax (Members of Constitutionally Protected Superannuation Funds) Assessment and Collection Act 1997 (Cth),\n\n\nwhich had the effect of imposing a special superannuation regime on State judges, particularly New South Wales judges.\nReformatted the test, these Judges indicated that there was only one true test of State immunity:\n\ndoes the law impair the capacity of the States or a State to function as a government?\nHowever, they both indicate that a law which invidiously discriminates against the States or a State is an example of such a law.\n\n\nendorsed by the High Court in Clarke v Commissioner of Taxation [2009] HCA 33, which was essentially a sequel to Austin\n\n\nClarke v Commissioner of Taxation [2009] HCA 33\n\nFrench CJ, in a concurring judgment, outlined six factors which he believed were relevant to the application of implied limitation (at [34]) indicia of Melbourne corp interference:\n\n\n\nWhether the law in question singles out one or more of the States and imposes a special burden or disability on them which is not imposed on persons generally.\n\n\n\n\nWhether the operation of a law of general application imposes a particular burden or disability on the States.\n\n\n\n\nThe effect of the law upon the capacity of the States to exercise their constitutional powers.\n\n\n\n\nThe effect of the law upon the exercise of their functions by the States.\n\n\n\n\nThe nature of the capacity or functions affected.\n\n\n\n\nThe subject matter of the law affecting the State or States and in particular the extent to which the constitutional head of power under which the law is made authorises its discriminatory application.\n\n\n\n\nHCA struck down on same basis as Austin\n\n\n\n\nState

Commonwealth.\nSections 282 and 297 of the Companies Act 1936 (NSW) dictated the order in which creditors would be paid off\n\nThe Commonwealth was entitled to priority only in respect of unpaid income tax.\nAt common law, the Commonwealth would have been entitled to priority in respect of all of Cigamatic’s debts to the Commonwealth.\n\n\nThe Commonwealth sought to have its common law prerogative priority respected, and claimed it was exempt from ss 282 and 297.\n\n\nHeld\n\nDixon J expressed the opinion that the States had no power to regulate the rights and duties of the

lodging.\nAffected by doctrine def\n\nState law will “affect” the Commonwealth executive when it chooses to enter into transactions governed by the “general law” of the State.\nThe “affected by”

this ordinary law includes federal law, common law and of course State law.\n\nMaguire v Simpson (1977) 139 CLR 362.\n\nIn that case, the Commonwealth Trading Bank, which represented the Crown in right of the Commonwealth, commenced proceedings to recover a debt.\nOther creditors argued that the Commonwealth’s claim was barred under the Limitations Act 1969 (NSW).\nThe Court accepted that the application of s 64 meant that the Bank’s procedural and substantive rights were governed by the same laws which governed a private litigant in the same situation.\n\nThus, the Bank’s right to recover the debt had been extinguished by the New South Wales Act.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommonwealth v Evans Deakin Industries (1986) 161 CLR 254\n\nConfirmed Maguire Interpretation\nThe Court confirmed that s 64

LECT NOTES\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Commonwealth Constitution contains a few express guarantees of individual rights:\n\na right to just compensation if one’s property is compulsorily acquired (s 51(xxxi));\na limited right to trial by jury (s 80);\nfreedom of religion (s 116); and\nfreedom from discrimination on the basis of State residence (s 117)\n\ninterpreted very narrowly until the

as compensation for that acquisition.\n\n\none is not constitutionally entitled to just terms if one agrees to sell one’s property for a poor price.\n\nJohn Cooke v Commonwealth (1924) 34 CLR 269 at 282\n\n\nOnly binds the CTH\n\n\nMinister for the Army v Dalziel (1944) 68 CLR 26\n\nStarke J stated (at 290) that property included “every species of valuable right and interest including real and personal property, incorporeal hereditaments def, such as rents and services, rights of way, rights of profit or use in land of another, and choses in action”.\n\n\n“acquisition” does not have to be by the Commonwealth directly, though it must be effected by a law of the Commonwealth.\n\nPJ Magennis v Commonwealth (1949) 80 CLR 382, where the relevant acquisition was made by the State of New South Wales under a Commonwealth law (a grants Act enacted under s 96) (see [10.35]\nconfirmed in Smith v ANL Ltd (2000) 204 CLR 493 where argument had been devoted to whether the beneficiary of the alleged acquisition, ANL Ltd, was “the Commonwealth or an emanation of it”:\n\nthe Court did not decide this issue as s 51(xxxi) “is not confined in its operation to acquisitions by the Commonwealth itself” (Callinan J at 556-557)\n\n\n\n\nAcquisition vs deprivation: What needs to be acquired?\n\nBank Nationalisation case (1948) 76 CLR\nThe objective of the Act was to facilitate the transfer of the entire private banking business to the Commonwealth Bank and “nationalise” the industry.\nThe validity of Div 3 was challenged.\nThe High Court unanimously found that Div 3 breached s 51(xxxi) as it amounted to the compulsory transfer of “effective” if not legal control over property.\nDivision 3 permitted the nominated directors to sell the businesses at a below-market price, so it contravened s 51(xxxi)\nCommonwealth v Tasmania (Tasmanian Dam case) (1983) 158 CLR\n\nThe Commonwealth legislation restricted the State’s use of its own land without the Commonwealth consent to such an extent that it effected an acquisition of that land by the Commonwealth.\n\nOnly four Justices considered this argument in Tasmanian Dam, of which three found no breach of s 51(xxxi)\nDeane J

purpose of protecting businesses and business assets from certain activities by protesters.\n\nOn compatibility, they found that the purpose of the law, which was to protect businesses from damage and disruption, was compatible with the freedom (at 363).\nOn suitability, the joint judges found that certain provisions failed the test, namely the four- day exclusion of persons under s 8(1)(b) from a business access zone upon being given a s 11 direction by a police officer, as well as the powers of police to direct whole groups to leave a relevant area under s 11(7) and (8).

Co (SA) Pty Ltd (1991) 174 CLR 1\nDescribed as “adjectival” law\nis governed by the lex fori which means that the applicable laws of procedure and evidence will be the laws of the forum, that is, the laws of the court which is hearing the claim.\nprocedural law regulates the way in which substantive rights and obligations are claimed and enforced, without impacting on the definition of those particular substantive rights.\n\nSubstantive law is the law that defines legal rights, duties, powers and liabilities\n\nThe distinction between substantive and procedural law was stated by the majority in John Pfeiffer Pty Ltd v Rogerson [2000] HCA 36\n\n\n\n\nJudging Civil Justice\n\nDame Hazel Genn, “Introduction: What Is Civil Justice for?” in Hazel Genn (ed), Judging Civil Justice, 2008 Hamlyn Lecture\n\nThe significance of procedure\n\nCivil Justice system comprises\n\nSubstantive law\nCivil procedure rules\nCourts\nJudiciary\n\n\nthe critical elements that contribute to perceptions of fairness are\n\nthe opportunity to be heard,\nthe opportunity to influence the decision maker,\neven-handedness of the decision maker,\nand being treated with courtesy and respect.\n\n\n\n\nSources of procedural law\n\nPowers provided by statute\n\nThe sources of procedural law in the NSW Supreme, District and Local Courts are mainly found in the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) (CPA) and the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (UCPR)\n\n\nInherent and implied jurisdiction\n\nThere is also inherent jurisdiction (or inherent power) in superior courts of record (such as the Supreme Court) to regulate their processes and prevent an abuse of process: Jago v District Court of New South Wales (1989) 168 CLR 23;\nThe District Court and Local Court have a limited jurisdiction which arises expressly under statute or is derived by implication from statutory provisions conferring particular jurisdiction:\n\nGrassby v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 1 at 16–17\n\n\nGrassby v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 1\n\nJurisdiction &amp; Citation: High Court of Australia, binding authority.\nProcedural History:\n\nAppeal to the High Court of Australia.\n\n\nCurrent Reason for Trial:\n\nExamination of the inherent powers of superior courts and the implied powers of inferior courts.\n\n\nMaterial Facts:\n\nThe case discusses the nature of the inherent jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of New South Wales and contrasts it with the limited, implied jurisdiction of inferior courts like magistrates’ courts.\n\n\nIssue:\n\nDistinction between inherent jurisdiction of superior courts and implied jurisdiction of inferior courts.\n\n\nLaw(s)/Statute(s) in Contention:\n\nInherent powers of the courts, Justices Act (specific to contempt powers of magistrate’s courts).\n\n\nTests &amp; Elements:\n\nDiscussion on the inherent power of superior courts stemming from their general responsibility for the administration of justice, and the principle that a grant of power carries everything necessary for its exercise.\nThe term “necessary” is defined not as “essential” but as what is reasonable.\n\n\nJudicial Opinions and Interpretation:\n\nThe High Court, led by Dawson J with Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, and Toohey JJ agreeing, outlined the inherent jurisdiction of superior courts and the limited, implied jurisdiction of inferior courts.\nEmphasized the fundamental distinction between these jurisdictions and the scope of powers derived therefrom.\n\n\nLegal Reasoning &amp; Ratio Decidendi:\n\nSuperior courts possess inherent powers due to their broad responsibility for justice administration, which includes powers not explicitly granted but necessary for the exercise of justice.\nInferior courts have limited, statutory-based implied powers necessary for their jurisdiction’s effective exercise.\n\nThe distinction between inherent and implied powers is crucial for understanding the scope and source of judicial powers.\n\n\n\n\nResult &amp; Relevance to Modern Law:\n\nAffirms the broad, inherent jurisdiction of superior courts like the Supreme Court of NSW, and clarifies the limited nature of implied powers for inferior courts.\nHighlights the judiciary’s structured hierarchy and the nuanced allocation of powers, underscoring the principle of necessary implication in statutory interpretation and the administration of justice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPelechowski v Registrar, Court of Appeal (1999) 198 CLR 435\n\nJurisdiction &amp; Citation:\n\nHigh Court of Australia, binding authority.\n\n\nProcedural History:\n\nKarl Pelechowski appealed against his conviction and sentence for contempt by the NSW Court of Appeal, originating from an order in the District Court.\n\n\nOriginal Dispute:\n\nThe dispute involves a loan agreement between Michael Rahme and Karl Pelechowski &amp; Penelope Jane Stephens (Penny Pelechowski), with Mr. Rahme seeking repayment through the District Court.\n\n\nCurrent Reason for Trial:\n\nAppeal against conviction and sentence for contempt relating to non-compliance with a court order.\n\n\nMaterial Facts:\n\nIn 1983, Rahme lent $50,000 to Pelechowski and Stephens, with agreement terms for repayment.\nA legal dispute over repayment led to a District Court order restraining Pelechowski and Stephens from dealing with their property until payment of the judgment.\n\n\nIssue:\n\nWhether the District Court had the implied power to make an asset preservation order restraining the appellants from dealing with their property, beyond the express provisions of legislation.\n\n\nLaw(s)/Statute(s) in Contention:\n\nReal Property Act 1900 (NSW),\nDistrict Court Act.\n\n\nPrecedences:\n\nThe decision references the principle established in Grassby v The Queen regarding the limits of implied powers in the context of judicial proceedings.\n\n\nTests &amp; Elements:\n\nThe decision discusses the concept of “necessary” powers as those reasonably required or legally ancillary to enforce specific remedies distinct from “essential” powers.\nIt emphasizes reasonableness as the criterion for determining such necessity.\n\n\nJudicial Opinions and Interpretation:\n\nGaudron, Gummow, and Callinan JJ. held that the District Court’s order granting asset preservation was beyond what was reasonably required or ancillary to the enforcement remedies provided in the District Court Act, effectively giving Rahme additional security not contemplated by the judgment itself.\n\n\nLegal Reasoning &amp; Ratio Decidendi:\n\nThe High Court concluded that the District Court exceeded its implied powers by imposing an asset preservation order without a clear basis for such authority in legislation, emphasizing the importance of undertakings to proceed expeditiously in such contexts and the limitation of implied powers to those that are reasonable and necessary.\n\n\nResult &amp; Relevance to Modern Law:\n\nThis case clarifies the scope of implied powers of courts, particularly concerning orders that affect the property rights of individuals post-judgment.\nIt underscores the principle that courts’ powers to make ancillary orders are limited to what is reasonably necessary for the effective exercise of expressly conferred jurisdiction, highlighting the balance between judicial discretion and statutory limits.\n\n\n\n\nGUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR PROCEDURE\n\nThe CPA sets out that the “overriding purpose of this Act and of the rules of court, in their application to civil proceedings, is to facilitate the just, quick and cheap resolution of the real issues in the proceedings”: s 56.\nThe court is to act in accordance with the dictates of justice in deciding whether to make any order or direction for the management of proceedings, including orders for amendment or adjournment: s 58.\nWhen determining the overriding purpose and the objects of case management (ss 56 and 57)\n\n\n\nthe degree of difficulty or complexity to which the issues in the proceedings give rise;\n\n\n\n\nthe degree of expedition with which the respective parties have approached the proceedings, including the degree to which they have been timely in their interlocutory activities; and\n\n\n\n\nthe degree of injustice that would be suffered by the respective parties as a consequence of any order or direction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADVERSARIAL SYSTEM OF CIVIL LITIGATION\n\nAdversarial model features\n\na party-controlled dispute (ie, the parties define the dispute and present evidence and argument);\nthe use of precedent, procedural rules and laws of evidence;\na reactive, impartial judge who acts as an umpire;\nreliance on oral testimony, which is adduced by witnesses and is subject to cross-examination.\n\nIn addition, advocates use oral argument in the presentation of their case;\n\n\nthe trial is the climactic end of the litigation process (and is distinct from the pre-trial stages of proceedings); and\nuse of the trial transcript for an appeal.\n\n\n\n\n“Cards on the table” approach to litigation\n\nConducting litigation as if it were a card game is now discouraged in the adversarial system.\nIn Nowlan v Marson Transport Pty Ltd (2001) 53 NSWLR 116, Heydon JA said at [26]:\n\nThe conduct of litigation as if it were a card game in which opponents never see some of each other’s cards until the last moment is out of line with modern trends.\n\n\nBaulderstone Hornibrook Engineering Pty Ltd v Gordian Runoff Ltd [2008] NSWCA 243\n\nJurisdiction &amp; Citation:\n\nNew South Wales Court of Appeal, persuasive authority outside NSW but binding within.\n\n\nProcedural History:\n\nAppeal in the NSW Court of Appeal regarding issues in civil litigation conduct.\n\n\nCurrent Reason for Trial:\n\nFocus on the necessity of cooperation, clarity, precision, and openness in the conduct of litigation, specifically in complex commercial cases.\n\n\nMaterial Facts:\n\nThe case emphasizes the importance of parties and their legal representatives working together to clearly express trial issues, referencing statutory duties and procedural laws.\n\n\nIssue:\n\nThe responsibilities of parties and their legal representatives in ensuring the just, quick, and cheap resolution of disputes by clearly and precisely identifying issues for trial.\n\n\nLaw(s)/Statute(s) in Contention:\n\nCivil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW), specifically the duty to assist the court in furthering the overriding purpose of dispute resolution.\n\n\nPrecedences:\n\nCites several cases that underline the importance of avoiding surprise and the duty of clear disclosure, including White v Overland, Nowlan v Marson Transport Pty Ltd, Glover v Australian Ultra Concrete Floors Pty Ltd, Sutton v Erect Safe Scaffolding (Aust) Pty Ltd, and Hooker v Gilling.\n\n\nTests &amp; Elements:\n\nThe decision illustrates the modern requirement for litigation to be conducted with full disclosure and clarity, reflecting a “cards on the table” approach to ensure all parties are aware of the issues and arguments to be addressed.\n\n\nJudicial Opinions and Interpretation:\n\nAllsop P, with Beazley and Campbell JJAs agreeing, underscored the evolution of civil procedure towards greater openness and cooperation among parties, mandated by statutory duties and procedural rules.\n\n\nLegal Reasoning &amp; Ratio Decidendi:\n\nThe court highlighted the statutory foundation for the duty of parties and their legal representatives to assist in the resolution of disputes by clearly delineating issues, which is essential for the efficient and fair conduct of trials.\nThe emphasis is on the necessity for parties to actively participate and cooperate in the litigation process to facilitate a just, quick, and inexpensive resolution.\n\n\nResult &amp; Relevance to Modern Law:\n\nThe judgment reinforces the principle that modern civil litigation, especially in commercial disputes, demands high levels of cooperation and disclosure from all parties.\nIt places a clear statutory duty on parties to assist the court, extending beyond traditional pleading requirements to encompass all aspects of litigation conduct, thereby ensuring that the real issues in dispute are promptly and efficiently addressed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 2 Ch 2: Case Management in New South Wales\n\nIntro\n\nTraditional Adversarial preparation\n\nAon Risk Services Australia Ltd v Australian National University (2009) 239 CLR 175 at [113], the High Court stated,\n\n“In the past it has been left largely to the parties to prepare for trial and to seek the court’s assistance as required. Those times are long gone”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJUSTICE DELAYED IS JUSTICE DENIED\n\nJackamara v Krakouer (1998) 195 CLR 516 at 526–527\nDelays are not beneficial and increase burden on the judicial system\nDelays increase costs due to memory fading and less/lost evidence\nBACKLOG REDUCTION\n\nBi v Mourad [2010] NSWCA 1\nDelay is a feature of litigation intended to be eliminated as far as possible by the statutory enactment of the regime in the Civil Procedure Act.\nEncourages Civil Procedure Act\n\n\nCOSTS\n\nCosts prevent access to justice and may be leveraged to torpedo cases or accept lower settlements\nthe average cost of litigation in New South Wales was somewhere in the range of approximately 60,000 to 90,000\n\n\nThe Complexities of Case Management\n\nCase management emerged under caseflow management in the United States in the early\n\n\nPerils of case management\n\nFront-loading and unnecessary running-up of costs\n\nFirst, costs may be front-loaded, with the result that parties who would in any event have settled their disputes are nonetheless forced to pay significant amounts for work done by lawyers in complying with case management requirements.\nThe second way in which judicial case management has the potential to drive up expenses is simply by being excessive\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCASELOAD MANAGEMENT AND MANAGERIAL JUDGING\n\nCase Management in New South Wales\n\nThe New South Wales Courts do not have what the Americans call a “docket system” under which cases are assigned to the judge who will conduct the trial for management\n\n\nThe Act and Rules\n\nThe Civil Procedure Act 2005 and the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules confirm and re-enact the powers of courts to confine a case to issues genuinely in dispute and to ensure compliance with court orders, directions, rules and practices.\nWhen exercising any power a court is required to give effect to the overriding purpose expressed in the Act, namely:\n\nto facilitate the “just, quick and cheap” resolution of the real issues in the proceedings.\n\nS 56\n\n\n\n\nObjects of case management – s 57 CPA\n\nThe just determination of proceedings.\nThe efficient disposal of the business of the court.\nThe efficient use of available judicial and administrative resources.\nThe timely disposal of the proceedings, and all other proceedings in the court, at a cost affordable by the parties.\n\n\nIn Australia, the second largest cost after legal fees is expert evidence.\n\n\nCourt Organisation of Management\n\nDistrict Court\n\nrequires litigants not to commence an action unless they are ready to proceed with it, save in the case of a time limitation problem.\n\n\nSupreme court\n\nCourt of Appeal, the Court of Criminal Appeal, the Common Law Division and the Equity Division have their own registrars responsible to judges for case management.\n\n\n\n\nManagerial Judging\n\nManagerial judging\n\nfocuses on the role of the judge in an individual case.\nThe judge tailors the procedures to be employed to the needs of the individual case.\nManagerial judging requires the judge to take an active part in directing the proceedings through its interlocutory stages\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE CIVIL PROCEDURE ACT 2005 AND THE UNIFORM CIVIL PROCEDURE RULES\n\nThe CPA and the UCPR consolidated the existing provisions about civil procedure into a single Act and a set of rules that apply uniformly to all three NSW courts\nSome major sections of CPA\n\nS 56\n\nJust, Quick, and cheap\n\n\nS 57\n\nObjects of case management,\nPart of the Just category\n\n\ns 58\n\nCourt

defective tiling work.\nHans Pet Constructions Pty Ltd sought damages for the cost of remediation against the Cassars, who provided the tiling services.\n\n\nProcedural Milestones\n\nClaim Lodgment: November 2007, highlighting the procedural commencement under the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules.\n\n\nDefence Filing:\n\nJanuary 2008, where the Cassars challenged the existence of a contractual agreement and the quality of workmanship, introducing counterclaims like contributory negligence and estoppel.\n\n\nPre-trial Management:\n\nDirections for evidence submission and trial scheduling were set, reflecting the Rules’ emphasis on timely and orderly case progression.\n\n\nKey Case Management Issues\n\nCompliance with Timelines:\n\nChallenges in adhering to the court’s directives for evidence exchange underscored the procedural rigors of case management.\n\n\n\n\nApplication of Case Management Principles:\n\nThe case elucidates the judiciary’s role in enforcing procedural discipline while balancing fairness and judicial economy, pivotal in the context of the Civil Procedure Act and Uniform Civil Procedure Rules.\n\n\nJudicial Observations\n\nThe trial and appellate levels provided insights into:\n\nThe necessity of strict compliance with procedural directives.\nThe balance between expedient case resolution and ensuring parties’ rights to a fair hearing.\nThe judicial discretion in managing litigation to conserve resources without compromising justice.\n\n\n\n\nOutcome and Implications\n\nThe appellate review critiqued the initial handling for potentially undermining procedural fairness, illustrating the tension between case management efficiency and substantive justice.\nEmphasized the importance of procedural compliance, timely litigation management, and the courts’ discretion in applying the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules.\n\n\nSignificance for Case Management and Civil Procedure\n\nPractical Application:\n\nThis case serves as a practical case

318\n\nThe court can depart from the principle of open justice in various ways.\nThe court can close the court to the public (ie, the proceedings are held in camera), or it can prohibit publication of all or part of the proceedings\nThe court can also make orders permitting a witness to give evidence behind a screen or via encrypted video-link or closed circuit television from a remote point; such orders can prevent the public and also the litigant/s from identifying a witness by sight and/or sound.\nThe court also has the power to make pseudonym orders to protect the true identity of a witness\n\n\nLegislation\n\nThe power to make orders to “close” justice can be the subject of specific legislation,\ns 71 of the CPA permits a judge to close the court to the public (see [1.250]), and the Court Suppression and Non- publication Orders Act 2010 provides for the making of suppression and non-publication orders\n\n\n\n\nCommon law power to depart from the open justice principle\n\nScott v Scott [1913] AC 417 at 437\nChief object of the courts of justice must be to secure that justice is done” and that “it may well be that justice could not be done at all if it had to be done in public”\nJohn Fairfax Group Pty Ltd v Local Court of NSW (1991) 26 NSWLR 131 at 16\n\nThe power to make orders to “close” justice is an inherent power of a superior court, and in statutory courts, the power to make orders that depart from the principle of open justice can be implied as necessary to the proper function of the court\nThe power of the court to depart from the principle of open justice and make the orders described in [1.160] is on the basis that such orders are “really necessary to secure the proper administration of justice” in the proceedings\nonly in “wholly exceptional” circumstances, not merely where such measures would be useful or desirable\nAttorney- General (NSW) v Mayas Pty Ltd (1988) 14 NSWLR 342 at 347 per Mahoney JA\n\nand would save

for contravening suppression orders under the Serious Sex Offenders Monitoring Act 2005 (Vic).\nThese orders prohibited publishing information that could identify certain sex offenders under supervision.\nHinch named these persons on his website and at a public rally, challenging the constitutionality of section 42 of the Act as a defense.\n\n\nOriginal Dispute:\n\nThe dispute centered on whether section 42, which enabled suppression orders, violated the constitutional mandates regarding the institutional integrity of Victoria’s courts or the implied requirement of court openness.\n\n\nReason for Trial:\n\nConstitutional challenge to the validity of section 42 of the Act.\n\n\nMaterial Facts:\n\nHinch publicly disclosed identities of sex offenders subject to suppression orders, aiming to contest the orders’ validity based on constitutional grounds.\n\n\nIssue:\n\nWhether section 42 undermines the institutional integrity of Victoria’s courts or contravenes the implied constitutional principle of court openness.\n\n\nLaw(s)/Statute(s) in Contention:\n\nSerious Sex Offenders Monitoring Act 2005 (Vic), particularly section 42, and its compatibility with Chapter III of the Constitution.\n\n\nPrecedences:\n\nCited precedents include Daubney v Cooper, Scott v Scott, Russell v Russell, and Forge v Australian Securities and Investments Commission, among others, to discuss the open-court principle and its exceptions.\n\n\nTests:\n\nThe Court examined whether the application of section 42 detrimentally affects the institutional integrity of the courts or contravenes the implied principle of open justice under the Constitution.\n\n\nJudicial Opinions and Interpretation:\n\nThe majority acknowledged the fundamental principle of courts operating publicly to maintain confidence and ensure accountability.\nYet, it recognized that the principle is not absolute, allowing for exceptions where necessary to administer justice properly.\nIt was determined that section 42, while imposing restrictions, does not infringe upon the institutional integrity of courts nor the essential characteristics required for the exercise of judicial power.\n\n\nRatio Decidendi:\n\nThe High Court found section 42 valid, ruling that it does not impermissibly diminish the courts’ integrity nor contravene the constitutional implication of open justice.\n\n\nConclusion and Relevance to Modern Law:\n\nThe decision reaffirms the balance between the principle of open justice and the necessity of certain restrictions to protect the administration of justice.\nIt highlights the courts’ capacity to limit the open justice principle under specific circumstances without undermining their constitutional role.\nThis case is pivotal in understanding the scope of legislative power in imposing constraints on court proceedings and the dissemination of related information, emphasizing the careful consideration required to uphold both transparency and justice.\n\n\n\n\nCommon law categories of cases that are exceptions to the open justice principle\n\nExceptions to the principle of open justice are valid in few categories of cases

proceedings.\ns 71 was applied by Barrett J in Re HIH Insurance Ltd [2007] NSWSC 498 to close the court on the application of the liquidators of insolvent HIH companies\nRe HIH Insurance Ltd [2007] NSWSC 498\n\nApplication under section 71 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 for an in-camera hearing regarding directions to liquidators and other litigation-related relief concerning companies in liquidation.\nTwo other public interests competing with the public interest in open justice.\n\nThe first is the public interest in the due and beneficial administration of the estates of insolvent companies by liquidators appointed by and answerable to the court, that administration being for the benefit of creditors.\nThe second competing or countervailing public interest arises from the fact that applications before me relate to the pursuit of litigation.\n\nThere is a clear public interest in the due administration of justice, in that in litigation in the normal course an ordinary litigant would keep close to the chest, as it were, the matters that the liquidators, because of their position, see fit to bring to court.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatutory power to make suppression and non-publication orders\n\nThe Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW) commenced on 1 July 2011 and provides for the making of suppression and non-publication orders by courts.\nSections 7 and 8 set out the power and grounds for making such orders.\nRinehart v Welker [2011] NSWCA 403\nJurisdiction:\n\nNew South Wales Court of Appeal\n\n\nProcedural History:\n\nThe case involved summonses seeking leave to appeal from an order dismissing motions for a stay.\nNotices of motion sought further orders prohibiting disclosure of information related to the appeals, building upon a suppression order previously granted by Brereton J.\n\n\nOriginal Dispute:\n\nThe dispute centred around family disagreements over the governance of a family trust, involving allegations of misconduct by a trustee.\n\n\nReason for Trial:\n\nThe appeals and related motions sought to address whether the proceedings should be held confidentially, in line with the confidentiality provisions of a Deed, and whether information related to the appeals should be suppressed.\n\n\nMaterial Facts:\n\nThe trustees and beneficiaries sought to keep the appeal proceedings confidential to adhere to the Deed’s confidentiality provisions and argued that public disclosure would undermine the intended confidential dispute resolution process.\n\n\nIssue:\n\nWhether a suppression order should be granted under the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 (CSPO Act) to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice by keeping the appeal proceedings confidential.\n\n\nLaw(s)/Statute(s) in Contention:\n\nCourt Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW), specifically sections related to the grounds for making suppression orders.\n\n\nPrecedences:\n\nCited cases and principles include the importance of the open justice principle, the conditions under which confidentiality can override this principle, and the statutory framework provided by the CSPO Act.\n\n\nTest\n\nNecessity\nProportionality and Specificity\nBalancing Interests\nTemporary vs Permanent\n\n\nJudicial Opinions and Interpretation:\n\nThe Court of Appeal discussed the balancing act between the principle of open justice and the confidentiality provisions of the Deed, emphasizing that the administration of justice includes encouraging parties to adhere to their agreements for alternative dispute resolution.\nThe Court scrutinized whether the suppression order was necessary to prevent prejudice to the administration of justice, considering the public interest in the conduct of trustees.\n\n\nRatio Decidendi:\n\nThe Court concluded that the suppression order was not necessary for the proper administration of justice and that the open justice principle should not be overridden by the confidentiality agreement between the parties, emphasizing that public confidence in the administration of justice is paramount.\n\n\nConclusion and Relevance to Modern Law:\n\nThis case underscores the significance of the open justice principle in the judicial process, illustrating the careful consideration courts must give to requests for confidentiality and suppression orders.\n\nIt highlights the judiciary’s role in ensuring that justice is administered openly and transparently, except in exceptional circumstances where confidentiality is deemed necessary to prevent prejudice to the administration of justice.\n\n\nThe decision reinforces the notion that agreements between parties to resolve disputes confidentially do not automatically warrant suppression of court proceedings.\n\n\n\n\nX” v Sydney Children’s Hospitals Specialty Network [2011] NSWSC 1272\n\nJurisdiction:\n\nNew South Wales Supreme Court\n\n\nProcedural History:\n\nThe Plaintiff sought an order under the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW) to prohibit the publication of her name and other identifying information, including that of her family members, to protect her privacy and psychological well-being in litigation against the Sydney Children’s Hospitals Specialty Network.\n\n\nOriginal Dispute:\n\nThe dispute involves a legal action against the Sydney Children’s Hospitals Specialty Network, with the specific details of the claim not provided in the extracted summary.\n\n\nReason for Trial:\n\nApplication for a pseudonym order to protect the Plaintiff’s identity due to her vulnerability and psychiatric condition.\n\n\nMaterial Facts:\n\nThe Plaintiff, represented by Ms. Sant, Junior Counsel, argued for the necessity of a pseudonym order based on the potential psychological harm and prejudice to the administration of justice that could arise from public disclosure of her identity.\nThe application was supported by the Plaintiff’s psychiatric condition and the potential for exacerbation of her symptoms if identified publicly.\n\n\nIssue:\n\nWhether a suppression order to prevent the publication of the Plaintiff’s identifying information is necessary to protect her psychological safety and ensure the proper administration of justice.\n\n\nLaw(s)/Statute(s) in Contention:\n\nCourt Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW), especially sections 7 and 8 regarding the grounds for making suppression orders.\n\n\nPrecedences:\n\nCited cases include litigation involving HIV-infected individuals and fertility cases, highlighting the court’s willingness to grant pseudonym orders in cases of particular sensitivity to protect plaintiffs from stigma or embarrassment.\n\n\nJudicial Opinions and Interpretation:\n\nAdamson J accepted the necessity of a pseudonym order to minimize harm to the Plaintiff and avoid prejudicing the administration of justice.\nThe judgment emphasized the minimal interference such orders have on the principle of open justice, balanced against the need to protect vulnerable individuals’ rights to pursue legal remedies without undue harm.\n\n\nRatio Decidendi:\n\nThe Court determined that a pseudonym order was necessary to protect the Plaintiff’s psychological safety and prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice, considering the potential harm that could arise from public disclosure of her identity.\n\n\nConclusion and Relevance to Modern Law:\n\nThis case underscores the court’s discretion to issue suppression orders under the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW) to protect individuals’ privacy and psychological well-being in sensitive cases.\nIt highlights the balance between the public interest in open justice and the need to protect vulnerable parties from the potential negative impacts of litigation on their mental health and personal life.\nThe decision sets a precedent for the consideration of pseudonym orders in similar cases where disclosure of a plaintiff’s identity could cause significant distress or harm.\n\n\n\n\nA v Bird; C v Bird [2015] NSWSC 570\n\nProcedural History:\n\nThe proceedings involve two sets of claims against the alleged offender for sexual assault on children, with additional claims against the conduct of a child care center.\nThe plaintiffs, including the mothers of the children, seek damages for psychological injuries resulting from the alleged assaults.\n\n\nOriginal Dispute:\n\nThe core dispute centers around allegations of sexual assault committed by the defendant against children in a childcare setting, with subsequent negligence claims against the childcare center and psychological injury claims by the mothers.\n\n\nReason for Trial:\n\nApplication for suppression orders to protect the identities of the alleged child victims and their mothers in litigation related to sexual assault claims.\n\n\nMaterial Facts:\n\nThe case involves sensitive allegations of sexual assault against children, with the plaintiffs seeking suppression orders under the Court Suppression and Non-Publication Orders Act to prevent the publication of their identities to protect their safety and well-being.\n\n\nIssue:\n\nWhether suppression orders should be granted to protect the identities of the plaintiffs and the children involved in the proceedings, considering the sensitive nature of the allegations and the potential impact on the victims.\n\n\nLaw(s)/Statute(s) in Contention:\n\nCourt Suppression and Non-Publication Orders Act, particularly sections related to the grounds for making suppression orders, and the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act, regarding the protection of child victims’ identities.\n\n\nPrecedences:\n\nThe judgment references principles established in prior cases, including the importance of protecting individuals, especially children, involved in litigation from unnecessary harm and distress.\nThe Court also considers legislative intentions to safeguard child victims’ identities in sexual assault cases.\n\n\nJudicial Opinions and Interpretation:\n\nMcCallum J emphasizes the need to balance open justice with the protection of vulnerable individuals involved in litigation.\nThe Court acknowledges the legislative framework designed to protect child victims’ identities and extends these considerations to the circumstances of the case at hand.\n\n\nRatio Decidendi:\n\nThe Court decides that it is appropriate to grant suppression orders to protect the identities of the plaintiffs and the involved child in the second proceedings, aligning with legislative intentions and judicial principles aimed at safeguarding vulnerable parties in sensitive cases.\n\n\nConclusion and Relevance to Modern Law:\n\nThis case highlights the judiciary’s role in protecting vulnerable individuals, especially children, in legal proceedings involving sensitive allegations.\nIt illustrates the application of suppression orders to balance the principle of open justice with the need to prevent harm to individuals whose identities might be exposed in the course of litigation.\nThe decision reinforces the importance of considering the welfare of child victims and their families in judicial decision-making.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 4: Alternative Dispute Resolution

when:\n\n(a) an important principle is involved, eg, the credibility of one’s product;\n(b) there is a need for legal precedent;\n(c) there is a need to send a message to the marketplace;\n(d) settlement would open the floodgates to frivolous litigation;\n(e) the claim is so large that the “discipline of litigation” is called for;\n(f) the claim is bogus, eg, the business organization is in the case solely because of its deep pockets, or perhaps because it made a product in the chain of distribution even though the product had nothing to do with the alleged harm;\n(g) the law is heavily

number of circumstances;\n\n\nr 20.5:\n\n‘The parties and the mediator must conduct the mediation with the object, so far as practicable, of completing the mediation within 28 days’;\n\n\ns 28:\n\nthe costs of mediation are borne by the parties themselves.\n\n\n\n\nArbitration under the CPA\n\nEmbedded in Part 5 of the CPA.\nFeatures of court-referred arbitration:\n\ns 37 of the CPA gives the jurisdiction of the arbitrator.\n\nSub-section 2): ‘without limiting the specific powers and authorities of an arbitrator under this Part, an arbitrator has and may exercise, in relation to referred proceedings, all of the functions of the court by which the proceedings were referred’;\n\n\ns 39(4): ‘An arbitrator may not make a determination that could not have been made had the proceedings been heard and determined by the referring court. ’\n\n\n\n\nFeatures of arbitration under the CPA\n\ns 48:\n\na party has the same right to representation by a solicitor and/or barrister and the same right to examine and cross-examine witnesses as would be the case in the referring court;\n\n\ns 49:\n\n‘(1) Subject to this Act and any directions given by the referring court, the procedure at an arbitratio is to be determined by the arbitrator.\n(2) Subject to the rules o evidence, an arbitrator must act according to equity, good conscience and the substantial merits of the case without regard for technicalities or legal forms’;\n\n\ns 40:\n\nthe judgement of the arbitrator is taken to be a judgment of the court, and can be enforced as such;\n\n\ns 54,\n\nan arbitrator can make costs orders for the arbitration proceedings.\n\n\nNote option of rehearing: CPA ss 42-47\n\n\n\n\nNegotiation\n\nNegotiation keywords\n\nPosition: what a person says they want – a demand e.g. ‘I want $1,000,000 in damages for a breach of contract’ is a position.\nInterest: why the person has that position – the need, desire, fears or concerns behind the demand e.g. ‘I want the $1,000,000 because I need to shore up my business and be in a position to take future orders.’\n\n\nNegotiation styles\n\nPositional negotiation:\n\nbased on parties’ respective positions or claims;\nlinear and reciprocal concession-making moving towards a compromise;\nadversarial and potentially damages relationships.\n\n\nInterest-based negotiation:\n\nexploring and satisfying interests of each party;\ncan be hard work;\ntest assumptions;\ninclusion, participation, being heard and valued.\n\n\nConstructive/reflexive negotiation:\n\nBlending and balancing P and I-B approaches;\nZero sum game vs mutual gain and producing additional value and gain;\nClosed and fixed versus open, flexible and reflective. 15\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJurisdiction – an introduction\n\nIn simplest terms, jurisdiction is the authority to decide.\n\nJurisdiction is inextricably linked to the rise of the modern nation-state in the aftermath of the Peace of Westphalia.\n\n\nThe nation state is characterised by sovereignty, of which jurisdiction is a legal consequence.\nTwo species of jurisdiction\n\n\n\nSubject matter jurisdiction:\n\n\nthe nature of the disputes which may be adjudicated by a particular court e.g. the Local Court is not going to possess subject matter jurisdiction to deal with murder.\n\n\n\n\nTerritorial jurisdiction:\n\n\nthis specifies the person or bodies over whom the court may exercise jurisdiction i.e. people or subjects within it territory.\n\n\nA court must possess both in order to exercise judicial power over a person/entity.\n\n\nSubject matter jurisdiction\n\ns 23 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW):\n\n‘The Court shall have all jurisdiction which may be necessary for the administration of justice in New South Wales.’\n\n\nSupreme Court divided into two main divisions:\n\nthe Common Law Division, which deals with civil, criminal and administrative law matters; and\nthe Equity Division hears cases involving commercial law, corporations law, equity, trusts, probate and matters pursuant to family provisions legislation.\n\n\nSubject matter jurisdiction capable of being altered by statute.\nSuperior courts inherent jurisdiction is also an aspect of its subject matter jurisdiction.\n\n\nTerritorial jurisdiction\n\nThere are three ways in which territorial jurisdiction can be satisfied:\n\n\n\nPhysical presence in the territory of jurisdiction e.g. the defendant is in NSW. See Laurie v Carroll (1958) 98 CLR 310;\n\n\n\n\nVoluntary submission to jurisdiction – a particular person or entity has voluntarily agreed to submit to the jurisdiction of the NSW Supreme Court; and\n\n\n\n\nStatutory extension of territorial jurisdiction e.g. with the agreement of other nation states through treaties, the inclusion of extra-territorial clauses in Acts etc\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross-vesting scheme\n\nJurisdiction in federal states like Australia can often be confused, overlapping and duplicate.\nTwo essential features of the cross-vesting scheme:\n\n\n\nIt invests or confers the original and appellate jurisdiction of each of the participating courts in or on each of the other participating courts (with some exclusions);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt provides a mechanism for the transfer of specific proceedings to the best suited court.\n\n\nNB – Re Wakim; Ex Parte McNally (1999) 198 CLR 511 rendered the conferral of state jurisdiction on federal courts under the original scheme invalid.\nRelevant legislation:\n\nJurisdiction of Courts (Cross-Vesting) Act 1987 (Cth) and\nthe Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-Vesting) Act 1987 (NSW).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransferring proceedings between courts\n\nDiscussing s 5 of the Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-Vesting) Act 1987 (NSW):\n\n‘Section 5(1) provides for the transfer of proceedings from the Supreme Court to the Federal Court or Family Court;\ns 5(2) provides for the transfer of proceedings from the Supreme Court to the Supreme Court of another State or Territory;\ns 5(3) for the transfer of proceedings in the Supreme Court of another State or Territory to the NSW Supreme Court;\ns 5(4) for the transfer of proceedings from the Federal or Family Court to the Supreme Court\n\n\n\n\nThree considerations in transferring proceedings – s 5 Cross-Vesting Act\n\n\n\nWhether, apart from the cross-vesting scheme ‘the relevant proceeding or a substantial part of it’ would have been incapable of being instituted in the court in question\n\n\ni.e. would the chosen Court have had the capacity to hear the dispute in the absence of the cross-vesting legislation;\n\n\n\n\nThe extent to which the case involved an issue of ‘the application, interpretation or validity of a law’ of the receiving court; and\n\n\n\n\nThe interests of justice.\n\n\n\n\nThe interests of justice\n\nBHP Billiton Ltd v Schultz (2004) 221 CLR 400 establishes that the interests of justice are broader than the interests of one party – rather, it involves weighing the interests of all the parties.\nSome relevant considerations include:\n\nthe place/places where the parties and/or witnesses reside or carry on business;\nthe location of the subject matter of the dispute;\nthe importance of local knowledge to the resolution of the issues;\nthe law governing the relevant transaction;\nthe procedures available in the different courts;\nthe likely hearing dates in the different courts;\nwhether it is sought to transfer the proceedings to a specialised court, for example, the Family Court; and\nis there an exclusive jurisdiction clause nominating the courts of a particular State for the resolution of disputes?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLimitation periods\n\nLimitation statutes impose a time limit within which you must commence proceedings for a cause of action.\n\nSome reasons for limitation periods:\n\nThe ability to administer justice can degrade over time e.g. memories fade, witnesses move away/die etc;\nWe value certainty and timeliness in proceedings.\n\nSee Brisbane South Regional Health Authority v Taylor (1996) 186 CLR 541\n\n\nBut, note critiques of limitation periods in relation to historical injustices.\n\n\nKey piece of legislation in NSW: Limitation Act 1969 (NSW).\n\n\nSome common limitation periods\n\nFrom the Limitation Act 1969 (NSW):\n\ns 14(1)(a): for most breaches of contract, six year limitation period.\ns 14(1)(b): six year limitation period for most species of tort.\ns 27(2): twelve year limitation period in cases involving the recovery of land for people other than the Crown..\ns 50C(1): in cases of personal injury, three years post discovering the cause of action, or twelve years in the event you don’t discover it, whichever expires first\n\n\n\n\n[l]awyers may use ADR not for the accomplishment of a ‘better’ result, but as another weapon in the adversarial arsenal to manipulate time, methods of discovery, and rules of procedure for perceived client advantage”\nTYPES OF ADR PROCESSES\n\nFacilitative dispute resolution processes\n\nare processes in which a dispute resolution practitioner assists the parties to a dispute to identify the disputed issues, develop options, consider alternatives and endeavour to reach an agreement about some issues or the whole dispute.\nExamples of facilitative processes are mediation, facilitation and facilitated negotiation.\n\n\nAdvisory dispute resolution processes\n\nare processes in which a dispute resolution practitioner considers and appraises the dispute and provides advice as to the facts of the dispute, the law and, in some cases, possible or desirable outcomes, and how these may be achieved.\nAdvisory processes include expert appraisal, case appraisal, case presentation, mini-trial and early neutral evaluation.\n\n\nDeterminative dispute resolution processes\n\nare process in which a dispute resolution practitioner evaluates the dispute (which may include the hearing of formal evidence from the parties) and makes a determination.\nExamples of determinative dispute resolution processes are arbitration, expert determination and private judging.\n\n\nCombined or hybrid dispute resolution processes\n\nare processes in which the dispute resolution practitioner plays multiple roles.\nFor example, in conciliation and in conferencing, the dispute resolution practitioner may facilitate discussions, as well as provide advice on the merits of the dispute.\nIn hybrid processes, such as med- arb, the practitioner first uses one process (mediation) and then a different one (arbitration).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNegotiation\n\nThe distinguishing feature of negotiation, compared to the other forms of dispute resolution that will be examined, is that negotiation involves no third party whose role is to facilitate, advise or determine the resolution of the dispute.\nadvantages and disadvantages of negotiation.10\n\nThe main advantages are:\n\nit is very flexible and can be conducted by parties and/or by lawyers;\nit is relatively cost effective, as only a limited amount of special preparation may be required;\nclients retain complete control of the outcome through conducting the process themselves\nor by giving instructions to their lawyer and the need for their approval of any agreement reached.\n\n\nThe main drawbacks are:\n\nsuccess depends to a significant extent on how well the dispute has been researched and analysed;\nsuccess can depend on the skill of the negotiator, and the strategy and tactics employed;\nnegotiation may lead to a weak or poor outcome for a person if the strengths of a case are not properly exploited;\nthe informality of negotiation can lead to confusion over the process;\na negotiation may fail if party expectations are unrealistic, or the parties are too entrenched in their positions.\n\n\nTypes of negotiation\n\nPositional negotiation\n\ntends to focus on what a person wants as compared to interest-based negotiation which focuses on why they want it.\nEveryone wants a piece of the orange\n\n\nInterests negotiation\n\nwhy the person wants a particular outcome thus encompassing needs, desires, fears and concerns which can be reflected in both the substance of the dispute as well as the procedure\nOne party wants orange skin and the other flesh,\n\nMore efficient\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMEDIATION\n\nMediation is the most widely used form of ADR.\n\nIt involves a facilitated negotiation aimed at reaching an agreement.\nA neutral third party (the mediator) assists and facilitates an agreement between the parties.\n\n\nRole of the lawyer\n\nScale of Lawyer’s role - Less to Most involvement scale\n\nAbsent advisor\n\nassists the client to prepare for the mediation but does not attend the mediation session itself.\n\n\nAdvisor observer\n\nsupport the client to participate effectively in the process.\nperforms the same role as the absent advisor, but the lawyer attends the mediation.\n\n\nExpert contributor\n\nperforms all of the tasks of the advisor observer.\nlawyers engage with one another during the mediation about the legal issues, that is, views on the applicable\n\n\nSupportive professional participant\n\nWorks with the client to prepare for the mediation and supports the client through the mediation process, by working collaboratively towards an acceptable outcome.\nThe lawyer and client work as a team\n\n\nSpokesperson\n\nspeaks on behalf of her or his client throughout the mediation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMediation models\n\nAdvisory processes are those in which the mediator is not independent of the content of the dispute\n\ncan give information and advice as to the range of likely court outcomes if the case proceeds to court and will actively encourage the participants to reach an agreement within this anticipated range.\n\n\nfacilitative mediation model\n\nwhere parties need to be committed to settlement and able to generate their own options and solutions.\n\n\n\n\nPosition statements\n\nTakes place prior to mediation\nFormat\n\nplain English that can be understood by the parties and the mediator;\nclear and concise expression;\nlogically ordered with headings and use of bullet points;\nrespectfully worded;\npersuasive.\n\nThis is an opportunity to communicate directly with an opponent and a mediator.\n\n\n\n\nElements\n\nHeading:\n\nit should be headed up with the names and description of the parties (eg, plaintiff, lessor or sub- contractor) and marked “Without Prejudice and for use in the Mediation only”.\n\n\nFormalities:\n\nit should also include the date and time of the mediation, the name of the mediator, a list of the individuals attending the mediation on behalf of the party on whose behalf the statement is made, and their connection with the dispute\n\n\nIssues:\n\nit should identify the issues in the case, both legal and factual.\nThe statement should also identify the key issues that are of vital importance to the parties at the date of the mediation\n\n\nOutline of the party’s case on issues:\n\nthe statement needs to clearly set out the party’s position in relation to each of the issues\nThe statement may make brief reference to statements of case, key documents or evidence, and matters of law that support the party’s position\n\n\nThe party’s interests and objectives:\n\nthe key objectives that the party wants to achieve at the mediation should be identified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuty to act in good faith\n\nS 27\nWaterhouse v Perkins [2001] NSWSC 13\nThe procedure in a mediation session requires that a person who attends the mediation has authority to settle the proceedings and they may attend with legal representatives:\n\nUCPR r 20.6\n\n\nStatements made in the course of mediation are protected (as they are in judicial proceedings) in that they cannot give rise to an action in defamation:\n\nCPA s 30\n\n\nA mediator cannot disclose information obtained in the mediation unless authorised by the CPA:\n\ns 31\n\n\n\n\nHiggins v Higgins [2002] NSWSC 455\n\nProcedural History:\n\nApplication to the Supreme Court for compulsory mediation by the plaintiff, opposed by the defendants.\n\n\nOriginal Dispute:\n\nConcerns property in Camden, resided in by the plaintiff (mother of the first defendant and mother-in-law of the second defendant) since 1982.\nThe property was originally purchased by a company associated with the defendants, which later went into liquidation.\nThe defendants then transferred the property to their names, leading to the plaintiff seeking declaratory relief to recognize her contribution and establish a trust in her favor.\n\n\nReason for Trial:\n\nThe dispute revolves around the plaintiff’s claim for recognition of her contribution towards the purchase of the property and the assertion that the property is held in trust for her.\n\n\nMaterial Facts:\n\nThe property was acquired in the name of a company associated with the defendants, which later went into liquidation.\nThe plaintiff claims to have contributed to the purchase money.\n\n\nIssue Raised:\n\nWhether the plaintiff has a proprietary interest in the property due to her contribution towards its purchase.\n\n\nLaw/Statute in Contention:\n\nTrust law principles and the plaintiff’s alleged contribution towards the purchase of the property.\n\n\nPrecedences:\n\nReference to Morrow v chinadotcom Corp [2001] NSWSC 209, Idoport Pty Ltd v National Australia Bank Ltd [2001] NSWSC 427, and Remuneration Planning Corporation Pty Ltd v Fitton [2001] NSWSC 1208 regarding compulsory mediation.\n\n\nJudicial Opinions and Interpretation:\n\nJustice Austin considered the evolving approach to compulsory mediation, highlighting the discretionary power of the court under s 26 of the Civil Procedure Act to refer proceedings to mediation, with or without consent of the parties, especially when emotional or irrational considerations might be affecting the parties’ resolution approach.\n\n\nLegal Reasoning:\n\nThe discretion under s 26 of the Civil Procedure Act is broad, allowing the court to take all relevant circumstances into account when considering mediation.\nIn this case, the plaintiff’s deteriorating health and desire to reconcile the family were deemed significant.\n\n\nRatio Decidendi:\n\nThe court has a wide discretion to order mediation in circumstances where it believes mediation might be successful, even if one party is opposed to it.\nThe specific circumstances of the case, including the plaintiff’s health and the potential for family reconciliation, were pivotal in deciding to order mediation.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe court ordered the proceedings to be referred for mediation, highlighting the importance of attempting to resolve disputes through mediation before proceeding to a contested hearing, particularly in cases where family relationships might be further strained by litigation.\nThis decision emphasizes the court’s preference for dispute resolution methods that preserve family relationships and the wide discretion it has in ordering mediation.\n\n\nRelevance to Modern Law:\n\nThis case demonstrates the judiciary’s growing inclination towards alternative dispute resolution methods, especially in family and property disputes where relationships might be preserved or restored.\nIt underscores the evolving legal landscape where courts actively encourage parties to engage in mediation, reflecting a broader shift towards less adversarial dispute resolution mechanisms.\n\n\n\n\nWaterhouse v Perkins [2001] NSWSC 13\n\nProcedural History:\n\nThe plaintiff initiated two defamation actions related to the publication of “The Gambling Man,” filed in 1991 and 1996, respectively.\nDefendants requested compulsory mediation, which the plaintiff refused.\n\n\nIssue Raised:\n\nWhether the court should order compulsory mediation in defamation cases, especially considering the plaintiff’s desire for public vindication.\n\n\nLaw/Statute in Contention:\n\nSection 26 of the Civil Procedure Act (formerly s 110K of the Supreme Court Act), granting the court the discretion to order mediation without parties’ consent.\n\n\nJudicial Opinions and Interpretation:\n\nLevine J emphasized the court’s power under the CPA to order mediation without consent and the duty of parties to participate in good faith.\nThe judge rejected the notion that mediation could not achieve vindication for the plaintiff, suggesting it’s a possibility if conducted in good faith.\n\n\nLegal Reasoning:\n\nThe court considered the significant time elapsed since the actions were initiated, the expected length and cost of a jury trial, and the potential for mediation to address not just “rights” but “interests and needs” of the parties.\nThe argument that mediation cannot provide vindication was deemed overly simplistic.\n\n\nRatio Decidendi:\n\nCompulsory mediation can be ordered in defamation cases, considering the lengthy litigation process, potential cost savings, and the possibility of achieving a form of vindication through mediation.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe court ordered the proceedings to be referred for mediation, highlighting the benefits of exploring resolutions outside of traditional trial settings, even in complex defamation cases where vindication is a key concern.\n\n\nRelevance to Modern Law:\n\nThis decision underscores the judiciary’s broad discretion in directing parties towards mediation, even in defamation litigation, to potentially save on costs and court time while also addressing the parties’ interests and needs in a more flexible manner.\nIt emphasizes the evolving approach to resolving disputes through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, even in cases where public vindication is a significant factor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nARBITRATION\n\nArbitration\n\nA quasi-judicial process\nThe dispute is submitted to a third party (an arbitrator) who renders a binding determination (an award\n\n\nRe Carus-Wilson &amp; Greene (1886) 18 QBD 7,\n\ndeterminative feature of an arbitration as being an “inquiry in the nature of a judicial inquiry”\n\n\nArbitration elements\n\nArenson v Casson Beckman Rutley &amp; Co [1977] AC 40\n\n(a) there is a dispute or a difference between the parties which has been formulated in some way or another;\n(b) the dispute or difference has been remitted by the parties to the person to resolve in such a manner that he is

claims in the dispute; and\n(d) the parties have agreed to accept his decision\n\n\narbitrator does not have power to compel witnesses, issue subpoenas or punish for contempt.\n\nIf conduct giving rise to such issues occurs in the arbitration, this must be referred back to the court: see CPA ss 50, 52 and 53\n\n\n\n\nMacDougall v Curleveski (1996) 40 NSWLR 430\n\nCosts may be ordered against a

indemnity due to subsidence in the AMC car park, despite both contracts containing arbitration agreements.\nKBR and Atlantis requested the court to refer the matter to arbitration under s 8(1) of the Commercial Arbitration Act 2010 (NSW).\n\n\nOriginal Dispute:\n\nConcerns around subsidence observed in the AMC car park 3.5 years post-construction, potentially linked to nearby construction activities by Laing O’Rourke.\n\n\nReason for Trial:\n\nDetermination of whether John Holland’s claims should proceed through court litigation or be referred to arbitration per the agreements.\n\n\nMaterial Facts:\n\nSubsidence in AMC car park leading to legal action against KBR and Atlantis, who were contracted for design and stormwater detention facilities, respectively.\n\n\nIssue Raised:\n\nWhether the disputes fall within the arbitration agreements’ scope and if court proceedings constitute an alternative dispute resolution process under the contract.\n\n\nLaw/Statute in Contention:\n\nCommercial Arbitration Act 2010 (NSW), specifically s 8(1) regarding court’s obligation to refer parties to arbitration if a dispute is covered by an arbitration agreement.\n\n\nJudicial Opinions and Interpretation:\n\nJustice Hammerschlag emphasized the broad interpretation of arbitration clauses and the legislative intent to minimize judicial intervention, ensuring commercial parties’ decisions to arbitrate are upheld.\n\n\nLegal Reasoning:\n\nThe disputes were deemed to arise from contract performance, making them subject to arbitration agreements.\nThe discussion of court litigation as an alternative dispute resolution during a conference did not alter this.\n\n\nRatio Decidendi:\n\nThe court must refer disputes to arbitration when covered by an arbitration agreement, upholding the autonomy of commercial agreements and minimizing judicial intervention.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe court ordered the disputes to arbitration, demonstrating the enforcement of arbitration agreements and the preference for arbitration in resolving commercial disputes.\n\n\nRelevance to Modern Law:\n\nThis case underscores the importance of arbitration as a dispute resolution mechanism in commercial contracts and the judiciary’s role in enforcing arbitration agreements, affirming the commitment to contractual autonomy and the efficient resolution of disputes.\n\n\n\n\nCave v Allen Jack and Cottier Pty Ltd [2014] NSWSC 1365\n\nJurisdiction:\n\nNew South Wales Supreme Court - Binding in NSW.\n\n\nProcedural History:\n\nThe plaintiff sought to refer the entirety of the proceedings to a referee under Rule 20.14, aimed at ensuring the just, quick, and cheap resolution of disputes.\n\n\nOriginal Dispute:\n\nActions for breach of contract and negligence involving the construction of a home.\nThe plaintiff, a homeowner, sued the architect, structural engineer, and builder associated with her home’s design and construction.\n\n\nReason for Trial:\n\nTo resolve disputes regarding breach of contract, negligence, the scope of necessary rectifying works, and associated costs.\n\n\nMaterial Facts:\n\nConstruction issues with a home on the Central Coast, designed and constructed around the turn of the century, leading to claims for rectification.\n\n\nIssue Raised:\n\nThe suitability of referring the entire proceedings to a referee, given the technical, legal, and factual complexities involved.\n\n\nLaw/Statute in Contention:\n\nApplication of Rule 20.14 for referral to a referee, considering the case’s intricacies and the potential for expedited, cost-effective resolution.\n\n\nPrecedences:\n\nReference to Ritchie’s Uniform Civil Procedure New South Wales on the discretionary nature of Rule 20.14.\n\n\nJudicial Opinions and Interpretation:\n\nCampbell J considered the benefits of referral to a referee, such as speed and flexibility, against potential drawbacks like lack of finality and legal complexities.\n\n\nLegal Reasoning:\n\nThe court found that referring the entire proceedings to a referee would best serve the overriding purpose of achieving a just, quick, and cheap resolution, given the specific circumstances of the case.\n\n\nRatio Decidendi:\n\nThe entire proceedings were referred out to a referee, recognizing the advantages of such a process in this particular case, including the potential for a more expedient and cost-effective resolution\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe court ordered the referral of the whole proceedings to a referee, likely a retired judicial officer experienced in construction and technology cases, to handle the case’s complexities more efficiently than a traditional court setting.\n\n\nRelevance to Modern Law:\n\nThis decision highlights the court’s willingness to utilize alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, like referral to referees, to manage cases involving technical expertise outside the conventional judicial process, promoting efficiency and reducing legal costs.\n\n\n\n\nEXPERT DETERMINATION\n\nExpert Determination def\n\na process in which the participants to a dispute present arguments and evidence to a dispute resolution practitioner, who is chosen on the basis of their specialist qualification or experience in the subject matter of the dispute (the expert) and who makes a determination.\nExpert determination may be compared with expert appraisal.\n\nThe former is binding on the parties, while the latter provides advice on the facts, possible outcomes and procedures to achieve the outcomes but it is not binding on the parties.\n\n\nHeart Research Institute Ltd v Psiron Ltd [2002] NSWSC 646\nAdvantages and disadvantages\n\ncan be designed and agreed to by the parties.\nNo pleadings,

constitutional validity of the cross- vesting legislation was challenged and a part of the scheme was held to be invalid.\n\nThe High Court held the scheme was invalid to the extent that it gave State jurisdiction to federal courts.\nPut another way, State Acts cannot confer jurisdiction in State matters on the Federal Court and Family Court.\n\ncannot give the Federal Court or the Family Court the authority to decide on matters that are under the jurisdiction of the state.\n\n\nHowever, the provisions in the Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-vesting) Act 1987 (Cth) relating to conferral of federal jurisdiction on State court\n\n\nThe cross- vesting scheme was amended after Wakim and now only provides:\n\nconferral of federal jurisdiction on State courts (s 4 of the Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-vesting) Act 1987 (Cth));\ncross- vesting of State jurisdiction among State courts (eg, s 4 of the Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross- vesting) Act 1987 (NSW)); and\ntransfer of proceedings between courts participating in the scheme (s 5 of the Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross- vesting) Act 1987 (NSW)).\n\nThis transfer is to the most appropriate court.\nTransfer is possible if both the transferring court and the court to which it is sought to transfer the proceedings have jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\nBHP Billiton v Schultz [2004] HCA 61; (2004) 221 CLR 400\n\nProcedural History:\n\nTrevor

BHP appealed to the High Court.\n\n\nOriginal Dispute:\n\nSchultz alleged harm from asbestos exposure, implicating BHP and others in negligence and other violations.\n\n\nReason for Trial:\n\nThe appeal focused on whether the proceedings should be transferred from NSW to South Australia, under the Cross-vesting Act, in the interests of justice.\n\n\nMaterial Facts:\n\nSchultz was a South Australian resident.\nBHP operated in both South Australia and NSW. Conflicting claims about where the asbestos products were supplied and the appropriate jurisdiction for the trial emerged.\n\n\nIssue:\n\nWhether the case should be transferred to South Australia, considering jurisdictional claims and the interests of justice under the Cross-vesting Act.\n\n\nLaws/Statutes in Contention:\n\nJurisdiction of Courts (Cross-vesting) Act 1987 (NSW)\nDust Diseases Tribunal Act 1989 (NSW), particularly s 11A\n\n\nPrecedents:\n\nSpiliada Maritime Corp v Cansulex Ltd [1987] AC 460 (English common law on forum non conveniens)\nVoth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Ltd [1990] HCA 55; (1990) 171 CLR 538 (Australian common law on forum non conveniens)\n\n\nJudicial Opinions and Interpretation:\n\nThe majority in the High Court found Sully J’s refusal to transfer was materially erroneous.\nThe decision to not transfer did not adequately consider the interests of justice under the Cross-vesting Act, improperly weighting the plaintiff’s choice of forum and the unique advantages of the NSW Tribunal’s section 11A.\nThe case was remitted for further consideration.\n\n\nKirby, Hayne, Callinan, and Heydon JJ provided separate judgments, all concluding that the Supreme Court of South Australia was the appropriate forum, ordering the transfer of proceedings.\nLegal Reasoning and Ratio Decidendi:\n\nThe High Court’s decision clarified the application of the Cross-vesting Act, distinguishing it from the forum non conveniens doctrine.\n\ndoctrine through which a court acknowledges that another forum or court where the case might have been brought is a more appropriate venue for a legal case\n\n\nIt emphasized that the interests of justice, rather than the plaintiff’s choice or specific procedural advantages of a particular court, should dictate forum selection.\n\n\nConclusion and Relevance to Modern Law:\n\nThis case is significant for its exploration of the principles governing cross-vesting of jurisdiction between state courts in Australia.\nIt underscores the flexibility and purpose of the Cross-vesting Act to ensure that legal disputes are resolved in the most appropriate forum, reflecting a nuanced approach to jurisdictional issues and the efficient administration of justice.\n\n\n\n\nBHP - Factors which could be relevant to the choice of forum include:\n\nthe place or places where the parties and/ or witnesses reside or carry on business;\nthe location of the subject matter of the dispute;\nthe importance of local knowledge to the resolution of the issues;\nthe law governing the relevant transaction;\nthe procedures available in the different courts;\nthe likely hearing dates in the different courts; and\nwhether it is sought to transfer the proceedings to a specialised court, for example, the Family Court: see Lambert v Dean (1989) 97 FLR 352\n\n\n\n\nLIMITATION PERIODS\n\nLIMITATION PERIODS\n\nTime period to bring a claim\n\n\nThe rationale for imposing limitation periods - Brisbane South Regional Health Authority v Taylor [1996] HCA 25; (1996) 186 CLR 541\n\nThe enactment of time limitations has been driven by the general perception that “[w]here there is delay the whole quality of justice deteriorates” [R v Lawrence [1982] AC 510 at 517\nA verdict may appear well based on the evidence given in the proceedings, but, if the tribunal of fact had all the evidence concerning the matter, an opposite result may have ensued\nfour broad rationales for the enactment of limitation periods.\n\n\n\nAs time goes by, relevant evidence is likely to be lost [Jones v Bellgrove Properties Ltd [1949] 2 KB 700 at 704\n\n\n\n\nIt is oppressive, even “cruel”, to a defendant to allow an action to be brought long after the circumstances which gave rise to it have passed [RB Policies at Lloyd’s v Butler [1950] 1 KB 76\n\n\n\n\nPeople should be able to arrange their affairs and utilise their resources on the basis that claims can no longer be made against them\n\n\n\n\nPublic interest requires that disputes be settled as quickly as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecific limitations Chart\n\n\n\n\nWeek 5: Initiating Proceedings, Commencing Litigation, Joining Parties and Causes of Action, and Drafting Pleadings\n\nProceedings commenced by the ‘originating process’\n\ns 3 of the CPA: the originating process ‘means the process by which proceedings are commenced…’\nr 6.2(1) of the UCPR: our originating process can take two forms:\n\nA statement of claim; or\nA summons.\n\n\n\n\n\nStatement of claim\n\nUCPR controls the content and form of many parts of a SoC e.g. division 4 of part 6 says that the statement of claim has to include the relief claimed by the plaintiff and the notice to the defendant.\nSome technical requirements spelled out in r 6.2(3A).

Because of that, it was preferable to exercise the court’s discretion in favour of separate trials.\nBirtles v Commonwealth [1960] VR 247.\n\nthe notion of “transaction” was given a broader interpretation than in Bendir v Anson\nFacts\n\nIn that case the plaintiff, while at work digging a hole, used a crowbar that contacted a high-voltage underground cable. He suffered an electric shock and sued the occupier of the land (the Commonwealth), the State Electricity Commission (SEC) and his employer.\nAll defendants claimed that the relevant limitation period had expired.\nThe SEC also claimed that it had not received the required statutory notice of the plaintiff’s intention to sue.\nAfter the defences had been filed, the plaintiff changed his solicitor and sought to add his former solicitor as a new defendant in the proceedings in an action for negligence in the event that he failed against the existing defendants\n\n\nAdam J held that the “transaction” included the accident and injury to the plaintiff as well as the matters relating to the litigation and the limitation issue\n\n\nPayne v Young (1980) 145 CLR 609\nProcedural History\n\nThe plaintiffs, operators of different Western Australian abattoirs, challenged the validity of regulations under which inspection fees were levied for carcass inspections by state authorities.\n\n\nOriginal Dispute\n\nThe dispute centered on whether the regulations imposing inspection fees were invalid.\n\n\nReason for Trial\n\nThe trial focused on the legitimacy of the inspection fee regulations and the joinder of multiple plaintiffs in a single claim for a declaration of invalidity and for recovery of fees paid under the alleged invalid regulations.\n\n\nMaterial Facts\n\nPlaintiffs had paid inspection fees to defendants under specific regulations.\nThey sought a declaration that these regulations were invalid and recovery of the fees paid.\n\n\nIssue Raised\n\nWhether multiple plaintiffs could join in a single action to seek a declaration of invalidity of the regulation imposing the inspection fee and recover the fees paid.\n\n\nLaw(s)/Statute(s)

plaintiffs in the claim for recovery of money due to the individual nature of the claims against each defendant.\n\n\nMinority (Murphy J dissenting):\n\nAdvocated for a liberal interpretation of the joinder rules, referencing liberal views in American and Canadian jurisprudence.\n\n\n\n\nRatio Decidendi\n\nThe joinder of multiple plaintiffs in a single action for the recovery of inspection fees paid under allegedly invalid regulations was improper due to the individual nature of each claim.\nHowever, joinder for seeking a declaration of invalidity of the regulations was allowed.\n\n\nConclusion and Relevance to Modern Law\n\nThis case underscores the strict interpretation of joinder rules in Australian law, emphasizing that separate causes of action must closely align in nature and subject matter to permit joinder.\nIt highlights the necessity for claims to arise out of the same transaction or a closely related series of transactions.\nThis decision has implications for future cases involving multiple plaintiffs with similar but distinct claims, guiding how legal practitioners structure their cases to meet joinder requirements.\n\n\n\n\nJoinder by leave\n\nDean- Willcocks v Air Transit International (2002) 55 NSWLR 64\n\nOriginal Dispute\n\nThe liquidator identified payments made to 58 separate suppliers and creditors as unfair preferences during the six months before three related companies went into liquidation.\n\n\nReason for Trial\n\nThe trial focused on the liquidator’s action to recover amounts deemed as unfair preferences paid to the suppliers and creditors.\n\n\nMaterial Facts\n\nThe liquidator initiated a single action against all parties involved, claiming the recovery of payments made to them by the liquidated companies, which were considered unfair preferences.\n\n\nIssue Raised\n\nWhether it is permissible under court rules to allow a single action (joinder) by the liquidator against multiple defendants for the recovery of unfair preference payments.\n\n\nLaw(s)/Statute(s) in Contention\n\nSupreme Court Rules and principles related to the joinder of parties and claims in legal proceedings.\n\n\nTests and Judicial Analysis\n\nThe necessity to identify a common question of law or fact across all transactions and to demonstrate that all rights to relief arise out of the same transaction or series of transactions.\n\n\nJudicial Opinions and Interpretation\n\nAustin J:\n\nHeld it was in the public interest to permit the joinder of multiple defendants in a single action by the liquidator.\nThis approach allows for the efficient pursuit of claims on behalf of all unsecured creditors and is supported by procedural rules, given the commonality of issues related to insolvency and the shortfall to unsecured creditors.\n\n\n\n\nRatio Decidendi\n\nThe rights to relief in the form of recovery of payments deemed unfair preferences can be pursued in a single action against multiple defendants, provided there are common questions of law or fact and a coherent link between the transactions.\n\n\nConclusion and Relevance to Modern Law\n\nThis case sets a precedent for the efficient management of insolvency proceedings, especially in cases involving multiple transactions that have led to unfair preferences.\nIt underscores the court’s flexibility in applying procedural rules to facilitate the just and efficient resolution of disputes, balancing the interests of the liquidator (and thereby unsecured creditors) with considerations of fairness and practicality for defendants.\nThe decision highlights the importance of judicial discretion in allowing joinder to promote the efficient use of court resources and reduce costs and delays in litigation, while ensuring fairness to all parties involved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJOINDER OF CAUSES OF Action\n\nThe considerations controlling joinder of causes of action and the joining of parties are interrelated because when parties are joined different causes of action may exist between those parties that have been joined\nCauses of actions can be joined in the same proceedings as long as the capacity of the plaintiff and defendant are within one of subr (1)(a)–(c) or if the court grants leave under subr (1)(d).\nUCPR 6.18 Joinder of causes of action\n\n\nJOINDER, EFFICIENCY AND Costs\n\nThe efficiencies of joinder can be lost when the resulting litigation gives rise to claims that are too disparate or the multitude of parties and causes of action creates too great a level of complexity\nCan solve one issue with multiple different points of contention, but not multiple issues that have different facts but same issue.\n\nBray v F Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (2003) 130 FCR 317\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitiating Proceedings and Pleadings\n\nSection 3 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) (CPA) defines the “originating process” as the process by which proceedings are commenced and includes the process by which a cross-claim1 is made\n\nTHE ORIGINATING PROCESS\n\nproceedings are initiated by using either a statement of claim or summons: UCPR r 6.2.\nA summons, on the other hand, is used where a question of law, rather than a substantial dispute of fact, is at issue. UCPR r 6.4\n\nA summons initiates a summary procedure, and a return date for determination of the matter is entered on the summons by the Court Registry when it is filed\n\n\nIf the plaintiff incorrectly uses the wrong originating process, whether commenced by statement of claim or summons, there are rules that nevertheless take the proceedings to have been duly commenced and that provide the court with power to make appropriate orders: UCPR r 6.5, r 6.6\nInformation that must be contained in the originating process is prescribed, as are the paper and margin sizes, those parts of the document that must be in bold print, and the requirements for a proper address for service.\n\nThe originating process should also specifically state the relief claimed: UCPR r 6.12\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPPEARANCE\n\nThe defendant may file an appearance or a defence and serve it on the plaintiff’s address for service as indicated on the plaintiff’s statement of claim or summons.\nRegulated by rr 6, 7, and 12\nEntering an appearance formally notifies the court and the plaintiff that the defendant intends to take some part in the proceedings and may indicate a submission to the jurisdiction.\nIt also acts as a waiver to object to any possibility that the originating process has failed to comply with the rules.\n\n\nPLEADINGS\n\nPleadings are formal documents filed in court and exchanged between the parties that set out the plaintiff’s claim and the defendant’s response to the claim.\n\nincludes a statement of claim, defence, reply and any subsequent pleading for which leave is given under Pt 14, but does not include a summons or notice of motion.\nR 14 regulations\nPleadings may be amended and, with leave of the court, even at the stage of trial.\n\nFurther, a court may decide a case on the evidence presented notwithstanding that a cause of action may have been pleaded defectively.\n\n\n\n\nIn Films and Casting Temple v Rajesh Malla [2013] NSWCA 377, the New South Wales Court of Appeal (Ward and Gleeson JJA; McDougall J) held that pleadings that had mischaracterised the effect of a contractual provision, the terms of which had been adduced in evidence at trial and proved without objection, did not preclude the court from deciding the claim on the basis of the contractual term as proved, not as pleaded.\n\nOriginal Dispute\n\nFilms and Casting Temple Pty Ltd (Temple) appealed a decision regarding a breach of contract by Rajesh Malla, specifically related to a personal assurance (PA1) and guarantees under a May 23 agreement.\n\n\nReason for Trial\n\nThe appeal focused on several key issues, including whether Malla breached the contract as pleaded, whether Temple was entitled to damages despite the pleading, the operation of Malla’s guarantee, the composition of the May 23 agreement, and the interpretation of “unable to pay” within that agreement.\n\n\nMaterial Facts\n\nTemple argued that Malla had breached a clause (cl 9.3) in the contract intended to protect Temple’s confidential information by engaging in activities with two Indian film projects without involving Temple for production management services.\n\n\nIssue Raised\n\nThe appeal raised questions about the interpretation and enforcement of contractual obligations, the scope of a guarantee, and the impact of mischaracterization in pleadings on the outcome of a case.\n\n\nLaw(s)/Statute(s) in Contention\n\nThe case primarily deals with contractual obligations, the interpretation of guarantees, and principles of fair trial and pleading requirements under civil procedure law.\n\n\nJudicial Opinions and Interpretation\n\nMcDougall J (with Ward and Gleeson JJA agreeing): Emphasized the importance of addressing the case based on the evidence and the actual provisions of the contract, rather than strictly adhering to how the claim was initially pleaded.\nThe court highlighted the flexibility in addressing claims that may have been improperly characterized in pleadings but are supported by evidence.\n\n\nRatio Decidendi\n\nThe court’s decision centered on the notion that a case can be decided based on the facts and evidence presented at trial, even if they diverge from the specific claims or defenses pleaded.\nThis approach is contingent on ensuring that such a decision does not unfairly prejudice the opposing party.\n\n\nConclusion and Relevance to Modern Law\n\nThe Films and Casting Temple v Malla case underscores the NSW Court of Appeal’s approach to dealing with issues of contractual interpretation, the importance of clear and accurate pleading in litigation, and the discretion of courts to grant relief based on the substance of the evidence presented, rather than being overly constrained by the technicalities of pleadings.\nThis decision reaffirms the principle that legal disputes should be resolved based on their merits, with due consideration for procedural fairness and the real issues in controversy, as evidenced by the conduct of the trial.\n\n\n\n\nYoung v Hones [2014] NSWCA 337, the New South Wales Court of Appeal confirmed that a reply should be used to respond to allegations in the defence.\n\nIt is not appropriate to use a reply to raise new allegations or causes of action against the defendant.\nThis would require an application to amend the statement of claim.\n\n\nBanque Commerciale SA (in liq) v Akhil Holdings Ltd (1990) 169 CLR 279\n\n[Akhil Holdings Ltd (Akhil) sued the Banque Commerciale (the bank), Deauville Nominees Pty. Limited (Deauville), and a Mr Messara for breach of trust for transferring shares without authority\nA copy of the reply to Messara was served on the bank, but Akhil did not file or serve a formal reply to the bank’s limitation defence.\n\nIf Akhil had made a reply alleging fraud the bank would have been entitled to details of the fraud alleged.\n\n\nThe bank appealed to the High Court of Australia where one of the main issues was whether the Court of Appeal could make a finding of fraud against the bank when that issue was not raised on the pleadings against it.\n\nThe fraud allegation was raised only in the pleadings against Deauville and Messara.]\n\n\nThe function of pleadings is to state with sufficient clarity the case that must be met:\n\nGould and Birbeck and Bacon

neighborhood drainage problem that were settled by consent orders.\nYears later, Young attempted to set aside these orders due to unresolved issues and sued her lawyer and engineering expert for negligent advice.\n\n\nReason for Trial\n\nThe trial examined the applicability of advocate’s immunity and witness immunity raised by the lawyer and the expert, respectively, as defenses against Young’s claims.\n\n\nMaterial Facts\n\nYoung’s attempts to reopen the settled case and sue her advisers were met with immunity defenses.\nThe trial judge decided that these immunities were a complete answer to Young’s claims, dismissing them before the close of pleadings.\n\n\nIssue Raised\n\nThe main issue on appeal was whether the trial judge erred by deciding on the immunities as complete defenses before Young had the opportunity to file a reply, where she intended to allege bad faith, potentially affecting the applicability of the advocate’s immunity.\n\n\nLaw(s)/Statute(s) in Contention\n\nThe case centered around the principles of pleading and the specific application of advocate’s immunity and witness immunity in civil litigation.\n\n\nJudicial Opinions and Interpretation\n\nWard JA: Highlighted that new claims or causes of action should not be introduced in a reply, and that a reply should not contradict the initial claim.\nThe rationale is to ensure clarity and efficiency in litigation, preventing unnecessary proliferation of documentation and associated costs and delays.\n\n\nRatio Decidendi\n\nThe Court of Appeal upheld the trial judge’s dismissal of Young’s claims, emphasizing that allegations of bad faith must be made in the statement of claim, not in the reply.\nThe court reasoned that a procedural decision had been made to proceed with the hearing on separate questions of law regarding immunities before the close of pleadings, with Young’s consent.\n\n\nConclusion and Relevance to Modern Law\n\nThis case reaffirms the importance of adhering to procedural rules and the structure of pleadings in civil litigation, particularly in New South Wales.\nIt demonstrates the constraints on introducing new allegations outside the statement of claim and the significance of consent in procedural decisions.\nThe decision also underscores the protective scope of advocate’s and witness immunities, even when there is a suggestion of bad faith, unless properly pleaded against in the initial stages of litigation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterial facts\n\nmaterial facts def will be those facts that are critical to supporting each

that is, how they are material to a cause of action.\n\n\n\n\nMarkisic v Department of Community Services of New South Wales (No 2) [2006] NSWCA 321\n\nA statement of claim must identify the cause of action, but simply identifying the cause of action will not suffice unless the material facts supporting that cause of action are pleaded as\n\nThis part was negligent in setting xyz up. - wrong\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurprise\n\nWhen all the material facts are alleged in the pleadings, the opponent has notice of the case that must be met.\n\nStrictly speaking, a party is not allowed to prove facts that are not properly alleged in the pleadings, especially if it would be unfair to the other party.\nHowever, obligations in regard to avoiding surprise do not relieve the plaintiff from fulfilling his or her legal burden of proof.\n\n\nKasupene v Ajax Foundry Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 309\n\nFacts\n\nThe appellant was injured on 12 November 2001 when a heavy tray which was being lifted by an overhead crane came down on his right foot.\nHe was employed by a labour hire company, Hussonee Pty Ltd and had been assigned to work at Silverwater in the business owned by the respondent.\nThe appellant sued the respondent and the matter was heard in the District Court.\nThe trial judge entered a verdict for the respondent.\nThe appellant appeals that decision.\n\n\nThe appellant emphasised the negotiations before trial and the agreement between the parties that the appellant would not plead a failure to adequately repair or maintain or other mechanical failure of the equipment.\n\nIt was submitted that this meant that there would be no suggestion made by the respondent that the accident was caused by the mechanical failure of the equipment.\n\n\nIt was submitted on appeal that in the absence of the respondent pleading mechanical failure, the only rational explanation for the accident is negligence in the operator of the crane\n\nThe circumstances of the present case did not impose an obligation on the respondent to plead in relation to prospective mechanical failure.\n\nThe respondent did not submit that the accident was explained by mechanical failure\n\n\n\n\nHeld that his Honour was correct to accept this submission.\n\nThe appellant was always required to prove his case\nAppeal failed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlover v Australian Ultra Concrete Floors Pty Ltd [2003] NSWCA 80\n\n[The appellant appealed a decision at trial that he did not injure himself at work in the way he asserted.]\nThe failure to plead the positive case asserted at the trial was, however, contrary to the surprise rule and goes a long way, on its own, in providing a satisfactory explanation for the appellant’s failure to call more witnesses to bolster his case that an accident occurred as alleged by him.\nHeydon JA in Nowlan v Marson Transport Pty Limited [2001] NSWCA 346; (2001) 53 NSWLR 116 approved the statement of Allsop J in White v Overland [2001] FCA 1333 at [4] that:\n\n[I] t should always be recognised that in the propounding of issues for trial the parties should take steps to ensure that all relevant parties to the dispute are cognisant of what the issues are\n\n\nThe respondent’s non-admission plea in answer to the appellant’s detailed description of the accident contained in the statement of claim, together with reliance by the respondent on the workers compensation payments made by it, would have resulted in the appellant being taken by surprise when, during the course of the trial, it was first made plain that the respondent was seeking to make an affirmative case in regard to the question whether the appellant was injured by an accident at work in the manner asserted by him.\n\n\nVerification\n\nTraditionally, material facts contained in pleadings were not assertions of their truth.\nThey were merely considered “written identification and communications of the extent of the plaintiff’s claim”\nUCPR r 14.23 requires a party’s pleading to be verified by affidavit which is made on the pleading\nFar as they believe, true\n\n\nPARTICULARS\n\nParticulars are details of the material facts on which the party relies in his or her pleadings.\nThey limit the generality of pleadings so as to more sharply define the issues but do not modify the cause of action\n\n\nBailey v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1977] HCA 11; (1977) 136 CLR 214\n\nGIBBS\n\nParticulars define the issues to be tried and enable the parties to know what evidence it will be necessary to have available and to avoid taking up time with questions that are not in dispute.\n\n\n\n\nBoral Bricks Pty Ltd v Cosmidis [2013] NSWCA 443\n\nOriginal Dispute\n\nCosmidis, a tanker driver employed by D M &amp; B P Wiskich Pty Ltd (Wiskich), was injured by a forklift driven by a Boral Bricks Ltd (Boral) employee after delivering fuel to Boral’s premises.\nCosmidis sued Boral for negligence, and Boral, in turn, joined Wiskich to the proceedings, seeking to reduce any damages payable to Cosmidis by alleging Wiskich’s negligence.\n\n\nReason for Trial\n\nThe trial focused on Boral’s negligence and the applicability of section 151Z of the Workers Compensation Act 1987 (NSW) regarding the reduction of damages due to Wiskich’s alleged negligence.\n\n\nMaterial Facts\n\nBoral pleaded a general reliance on section 151Z for reducing damages but did not provide particulars of Wiskich’s alleged breaches of duty.\nThe trial judge refused Boral’s late attempt to amend its defense to specify these breaches.\n\n\nIssue Raised\n\nWhether Boral was required to provide particulars of the alleged negligence by Wiskich under section 151Z and if the failure to do so affected the outcome of the trial.\n\n\nLaw(s)/Statute(s) in Contention\n\nSection 151Z of the Workers Compensation Act 1987 (NSW) and its application in cases where a defendant seeks to reduce liability for damages by attributing negligence to a worker’s employer.\n\n\nJudicial Opinions and Interpretation\n\nBasten JA: Emphasized the importance of particulars in pleadings, especially when a defendant wishes to benefit from section 151Z(2) of the Workers Compensation Act.\nBasten JA referred to precedent and clarified that identifying material facts in pleadings prevents surprises and ensures fairness in legal proceedings.\n\n\nRatio Decidendi\n\nThe Court of Appeal upheld the trial judge’s decision not to allow Boral to amend its defense to include particulars of Wiskich’s alleged negligence.\nThe court highlighted the necessity of providing particulars when a party intends to rely on specific legislative provisions to argue for the reduction of damages.\n\n\nConclusion and Relevance to Modern Law\n\nThe Boral Bricks Pty Ltd v Cosmidis case reinforces the principle that defendants seeking to rely on statutory mechanisms to adjust damages must clearly identify the material facts and particulars of their claims in pleadings.\nThis requirement ensures transparency, fairness, and the efficient management of legal proceedings, preventing the other party from being taken by surprise.\nThe decision underscores the critical role of particulars in pleading, especially in cases involving complex issues of liability and statutory interpretation.\n\n\n\n\nBWK Elders Australia Pty Ltd v Westgate Wool Company Pty Ltd (No 2) [2002] FCA 8\n\nThe tendency in pleadings in recent years has been to address matters of substance rather than matters of form.\n\n\nParticulars and evidence\n\nAllianz Australia Insurance Ltd v Newcastle Formwork Constructions Pty Ltd [2007] NSWCA 144\n\nGiving particulars of the case to be made out has been distinguished from disclosing the evidence by which the case is to be proved, but the distinction is not a clear one and the touchstone must be what is reasonably necessary to achieve the purposes last-mentioned.\nAuthority is hardly necessary, but there can conveniently be set out from the judgment of Hunt J in Sims v Wran (1984) 1 NSWLR 317\n\n\nProvided the other party is not treated unjustly, latitude may in practice be given to adduce evidence beyond the boundaries identified by the particulars\nDouglas v John Fairfax &amp; Sons Ltd [1983] 3 NSWLR 12\n\nWhere a party seeks to lead evidence in support of his pleaded case which is outside the particulars which have been supplied of that case, it is for the trial judge to consider whether such evidence unfairly amounts to a case of which the other party has had insufficient warning:\n\nVlasic v Federal Capital Press of Australia Pty Ltd (1976) 9 ACTR 1, at 6\n\n\nThe exercise of that discretion must necessarily depend upon many things, including the amount of warning that the other party has had that such evidence was to be led.\nWhat course should usually be followed by the trial judge in the various situations which may arise was discussed in\n\nReiter v Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd [1983] 2 NSWLR 137(n).\n\n\n\n\nDare v Pulham [1982] HCA 70; (1982) 148 CLR 658\nApart from cases where the parties choose to disregard the pleadings and to fight the case on issues chosen at the trial, the relief which may be granted to a party must be founded on the pleadings Gould and Birbeck and Bacon (1916) 22 CLR\n\n\nWhen are particulars required?\n\nUCPR r 15.1 merely states that a pleading must give such particulars as are necessary to enable the opposite party to identify the case that the pleading requires him or her to meet.\nAny application to the court for an order for particulars (see UCPR r 15.10) should be preceded by a written request for particulars to the opponent.\n\nUCPR r 15.10 does not prevent an order for particulars being given prior to a defence being filed. However, it should not be assumed that there is an entitlement to an order for particulars at this early stage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 6: Services\n\nWhat is Service\n\nService def:\n\nthe procedure by which a plaintiff informs a defendant of the claim being made against them.\nEssential requirement of natural justice.\nDesigned to ensure the document is brought to the attention of the person being served.\nAn important component of the rule of law &amp; necessary to enliven the jurisdiction of the Court.\n\n\nService – some rules\n\nA general departure point, r 10.1(1): ‘(1) Unless the court orders otherwise, a party that files a document must as soon as practicable serve copies of the document on each other active party.’\nr 10.5: specifies the general ways by which service can be effected.\n\nService quite simple once proceedings are underway.\n\n\nr 10.20(2)(a): originating documents in the Supreme Court have to be personally served.\n\n\nWhat is involved in personal service?\n\nPersonal service can be effected by plaintiff – more commonly it is by a process server or the NSW Sheriff.\nr 10.21:\n\n‘(1) Personal service of a document on a person is effected by leaving a copy of the document with the person or, if the person does not accept the copy, by putting the copy down in the person’s presence and telling the person the nature of the document.\n\nAinsworth v Redd\nwhere the defendant told the process server to give it to his representative who was standing next to him and afterward the defendant was heard to say: “We’d better look at these”\nGraczyk v Graczyk\n\nthe requirement of placing the document in the person’s presence was fulfilled by pushing it under a locked door.\n\n\nRe Hudson; Ex parte G E Crane &amp; Sons Ltd\n\nit was satisfied by attaching the document to the front of a locked door and at the same time telling the defendant that this was occurring.\n\n\nLawindi; Re Elkateb v Elkateb\n\nStone J said the requirement that the nature of the document be explained is not demanding and need not be done if the nature of the document is clear on its face\n\n\n\n\n(2) If, by violence or threat of violence, a person attempting service is prevented from approaching another person for the purpose of delivering a document to the other person, the person attempting service may deliver the document to the other person by leaving it as near as practicable to that other person.’\n\n\nr 35.8: affidavit of service required.\n\n\nPersonal service on corporations/business entities\n\nrr 10.9-10.11: service on defendants operating under a registered/unregistered business name or in a partnership is effected by:\n\nLeaving the document with someone 16 or over at the address\nwhere the business is carried out: or\nMailing a copy to the postal address of the business, addressed to the defendant.\n\n\nr 10.22: service on a corporation can be effected by:\n\nServing a copy on a principal officer of the corporation; or\nAny other method prescribed by law e.g. s 109X(1)(a) of the Corporations Act allowing service by leaving or posting the document to the company’s registered office.\n\n\n\n\nSubstituted service\n\nSubstituted service can take place in a situation where it is impracticable for personal service to take place e.g. because the defendant has proven very evasive.\nRegulated by r 10.14.\nOrder for substituted service will specify the steps required for service to be effected.\n\n\nLimits to substituted service\n\nIn order to prevent substituted service being the norm, there are two central considerations:\n\n\n\nSubstituted service only applies where the kind of service envisaged by the UCPR cannot be practically undertaken – sometimes referred to as “practical impossibility”.\n\n\nThe applicant should have made efforts to effect service properly,and/or should lead evidence to prove that such an effort would be futile – see Munkarra v Fischer (1980) 5 NTR 3;\n\n\n\n\nThe Court has to be satisfied that the proposed alternative means of service is reasonably likely to bring the proceedings to the defendant’s attention – see Flo Rida v Mothership Music Pty Ltd [2013] NSWCA 268.\n\n\n\n\nFlo Rida v Mothership Music Pty Ltd [2013] NSWCA\n\nProcedural History:\n\nFlo Rida entered a contract to perform at a music festival in Newcastle in 2011 but did not appear.\nThe promoter filed a claim for damages in the District Court and obtained a freezing order on Flo Rida’s assets in Australia.\nThe court permitted substituted service via email and Facebook.\nFlo Rida appealed the judgment, arguing improper substituted service.\n\n\nOriginal Dispute:\n\nThe dispute centered on Flo Rida’s failure to perform at the music festival and the ensuing legal actions for breach of contract, including the method of legal service for the proceedings.\n\n\nReason for Trial:\n\nThe appeal was focused on whether the District Court’s order for substituted service via email and Facebook was appropriate and legally valid.\n\n\nMaterial Facts:\n\nFlo Rida was in Australia for radio engagements when the legal action was initiated.\nAttempts at traditional service failed, leading to an order for substituted service.\nThe service was attempted via email and a Facebook message after Flo Rida had left Australia.\n\n\nIssue(s) Raised:\n\nWhether the District Court had jurisdiction to make an order for substituted service on a defendant not physically present in Australia.\nThe validity of using social media (Facebook) and email as methods for substituted service.\n\n\nLaw(s)/Statute(s) in Contention:\n\nUniform Civil Procedure Rules (UCPR) r. 10.14 regarding substituted service.\nDistrict Court Act 1973 sections 44 and 47 regarding jurisdiction and territorial connection.\n\n\nPrecedences Cited:\n\nByrne v Howard [2010] FMCAFAM 509 regarding substituted service via Facebook.\nASIC v Sweeney (No 2) [2001] NSWSC 477; Laurie v Carroll [1958] HCA 4; 98 CLR 310 regarding limitations on substituted service outside jurisdiction.\n\n\nJudicial Opinions and Interpretation:\n\nThe NSW Court of Appeal found the District Court’s method of substituted service inappropriate, given the international jurisdiction issues and the lack of concrete evidence connecting Flo Rida to the Facebook account used for service.\n\n\nLegal Reasoning and Ratio Decidendi:\n\nThe court reasoned that substituted service via digital means without concrete evidence of its effectiveness or proper jurisdictional basis was insufficient.\nThe decision hinged on ensuring due legal process and the appropriateness of service methods within jurisdictional limits.\n\n\nConclusion and Relevance to Modern Law:\n\nThe appeal was upheld, and the judgment against Flo Rida was set aside.\nThis case emphasizes the need for clear jurisdictional authority and the adequacy of service methods in the digital age, impacting future cases involving international defendants and digital communication platforms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUrgency\n\nAmos Removals &amp; Storage Pty Ltd v Small\n\na summons was issued on a Thursday that had to be served by 5 pm Friday and there were 19 defendants who were spread across New South Wales.\nUnder those circumstances, substituted service was allowed.\n\n\n\n\nBulldogs Rugby League Club Ltd v Williams [2008] NSWSC 822\n\nBulldogs trying to serve Williams to commence proceedings for breach of contract.\nUnable initially to effect personal service – Williams is in France.\nOrder for substituted service specifies that:\n\nCopies to be left at registered addresses of Toulon Rugby club;\nCopies left at Williams’ Sydney residence;\nText messages sent to what appears to be Williams phone number and that of his manager.\n\n\n\n\nNash v Stewart [2010] NSWSC 513\n\nBarrett J held that an order for substituted service could not be made in respect of personal service of a subpoena to give evidence.\nDivision 3 of Part 10, rule 10.20(1) makes it clear that personal service is compulsory, not optional, in cases where the rules require it.\n\n\nService outside of NSW but in Australia\n\nTwo main instruments:\n\n\n\nService and Execution of Process Act 1992 (Cth), known as SEPA.\n\n\nCan apply to proceedings in the Supreme Court, District Court, down to the Local Court. Importantly, out-of-state service relating to proceedings in these last two, the District and Local Court, has to be executed in accordance with SEPA;\n\n\n\n\nr 10.3 of the UCPR.\n\n\nIn practice, SEPA is almost invariably used.\n\n\n\n\nMunkarra v Fisher\n\nthe plaintiff was injured in an accident involving a motor cycle in Darwin.\nThe offending motor bike was registered and insured in Western Australia, and the rider was a German national who held a Northern Territory and international driver’s licence.\nImmigration records showed that he had arrived in Australia two years earlier, and there was no record that he had left. At the time of the accident he was resident in the South Darwin Caravan Park, and his current address was unknown.\nThe plaintiff showed that the application was not urgent and that incomplete checks of official records (driving licences, electoral rolls, phone books etc) had been undertaken.\nThe court directed that further checks be undertaken with, for example, the German embassy and German clubs in the relevant areas\n\n\n\n\nSEPA\n\ns 15 of SEPA:\n\n‘(1) An initiating process issued in a State may be served in another State.\n(2) Service on an individual must be effected in the same way as service of such an initiating process in the place of issue.\n(3) Service on a company or a registered body must be effected in accordance with section 9.’\n\n\n\n\nService internationally\n\nFour different methods of service internationally:\n\n\n\nService by private means (i.e. using a process server or local agent in the concerned country). Regulated by Part 11, Division 1A of the UCPR;\n\n\n\n\nService through diplomatic channels i.e. through using the Attorney-General’s office and Australian embassies. Regulated by Part 11, Division 2 of the UCPR;\n\n\n\n\nService pursuant to the Hague Convention. Regulated by Part 11A of the UCPR; and\n\n\n\n\nService arrangements agreed in bilateral treaties. Service by private means is most important for our purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService by private means\n\nr 11.4: originating process can be served overseas without leave of the Court if it is in relation to a claim falling within Schedule 6 of the UCPR – a very broad provision.\nr 11.8AC: document we are serving overseas need not be personally served so long as it is served in accordance with the law of the country in which service is effected.\n\n\nService by private means cont.\n\nSome inbuilt mechanisms to regulate service overseas:\n\nr 11.6: if the person served overseas applies to the Supreme Court, then the Supreme Court can decide not to assume jurisdiction and can stay or dismiss the proceedings.\n\nThe Court can do so if the document wasn’t served according to the rules, if the court is clearly an inappropriate forum, or if the case has insufficient prospects of success;\n\n\nr 11.7: the document served on the party overseas has to include a notice to the defendant informing them of the scope of the jurisdiction of the court, the grounds alleged by the plaintiff to give rise to that jurisdiction, and the person’s right to challenge service of the originating process or the jurisdiction of the court.\nr 11.8AA: if you have served your originating document on someone in another country, and they haven’t filed an appearance within the appropriate time-frame, then the plaintiff may only proceed with leave of the Court\n\n\n\n\nHunter v Hanson [2014] NSWCA 263\n\nthe New South Wales Court of Appeal by majority (McColl and Macfarlan JJA; Emmett JA dissenting) dismissed an application for leave to appeal against the decision of the District Court to extend the time for service of a statement of claim\nThe respondent in the appeal had sued the applicant for defamation, and had decided to delay service of the statement of claim for two reasons:\n\nfirst, to wait for the delivery of an unconnected Court of Appeal decision with possible implications concerning absolute privilege on similar facts;\nand second, to avoid aggravating the situation with the applicant in respect of whose conduct the respondent had sought an apprehended personal violence order.\n\n\nAffidavit of service def\n\nAn affidavit attesting to the fact that the defendant (where, when, by whom, and how) has been served\nOften includes words used to deliver and words used in reply\n\n\n\n\nDocuments required to be personally served (r 10.5)\n\nNotice of Motion: A notice of motion is required to be served personally on a person who is not a party to the proceedings or who is a party, but not an active party: r 18.5.\nCopy of a judgment before committal or sequestration:\n\nA sealed copy of the judgment must be served personally on the person bound by the judgment: r 40.7.\n\n\nSubpoena:\n\nSubpoenas must be personally served on the addressee: r 33.5.\nHowever, r 10.20(2)(d) permits service by post of subpoenas for production in proceedings in the District Court or the Local Court\n\n\n\n\nService by agreement, acknowledgment or undertaking\n\nMondial Trading Pty Ltd v Interocean Marine Transport Inc\n\nan agreement concerning the appropriate jurisdiction to bring a claim was held not to encompass an agreement as to mode of service.\n\n\nWestpac Banking Corp v Thurairajah [2009] NSWSC 442 at [6] per Barrett J\n\nIn a case where a bank (the mortgagee) commenced proceedings against the mortgagor for possession of land the subject of a mortgage due to the mortgagor’s default in payments under the mortgage, the court held that a statement of claim could be served by leaving it at the mortgaged property because the mortgage included an express term to that effect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 7: Evidence in Proceedings\n\nEvidence in Proceedings\n\nTwo classic forms of evidence\n\n\n\nOral testimony e.g. the person sitting in the witness box giving evidence in chief at trial.\n\n\n\n\nAffidavit evidence: evidence committed to writing.\n\n\nIt is affidavit evidence which primarily concerns us today.\n\n\nWhat is an affidavit? It is simply the evidence of a witness reduced to writing that is sworn to or affirmed.\n\n\nSome important features of affidavits\n\nAffidavits largely governed by Part 35 of the UCPR.\nAffidavits that do not comply with rules about form can be struck out.\nNevertheless, an affidavit with an irregularity may be used with the leave of the court (r 35.1).\nNB – limits on who can make affidavits (e.g. limits where under legal incapacity, corporation, the Crown) (r 35.3).\n\nAlso limits on use of affidavits made by ‘blind or illiterate persons’ (r 35.7).\n\n\nDeponent may be cross-examined on contents of affidavit (r 35.2).\n\n\nAffidavits – rules of drafting\n\nName of deponent and date sworn or affirmed on front page as a heading: r 35.3A.\nAll pages numbered consecutively including annexures: r 35.6(3).\nAll paragraphs numbered consecutively: r 35.4(c).\nEach paragraph dealing with separate issue or event: r 35.4 (a)&amp;(b).\nEach page must be signed by deponent and witness: r 35.7B.\nAnnexures must be clearly identified e.g. This is the annexure marked “A”: r 35.6(2).\nJurat (which is the formal part at the end of the affidavit) must be completed: r 35.7A.\nChanges must be initialled or otherwise affidavit cannot be used: r 35.5.\n\n\nAffidavits – some conventions\n\nAffidavits should be stapled.\nMaximum size – 50 pages including annexures.\nOriginals must not be compromised by being stapled to an affidavit.\n\n\nOaths &amp; affirmations\n\nOaths and affirmation achieve the same purpose – the deponent attests to the veracity of the contents of the affidavit.\nThey create a consequence if the deponent has lied – they can face a charge of perjury.\nThe requirements for oaths and affirmations are set out in Part 5 of the Oaths Act and Division 2 of Part 2.1 of the Evidence Act.\n\nOaths Act 1900 (NSW) ss 26, 26B, 27, 27A, 32, 34\nFalse swearing\n\nOaths Act 1900 (NSW) ss 29–31, 33\n\n\n\n\nNote r 35.9 – only file an affidavit that complies with court rules and practice notes (see, e.g., Practice Note SC Gen 4, Supreme Court – Affidavits).\n\n\n\nAn archetypal affidavit\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery\n\nDiscovery is a pre-trial process whereby one side looks at the other side’s relevant documents or administers interrogatories to the other side.\n\nIt includes the notion of preliminary discovery.\n\n\nPurpose of discovery is to promote fair trial because:\n\nIt enables parties to best prepare their case; and\nEnsures judges will have evidence available to them to decide on the case.\n\n\n‘The right is peculiar to the common law jurisdictions. In plain language, litigation in this country is conducted ‘cards face up on the table’…litigation is not a war or even a game. It is designed to do real justice between opposing parties and, if the court does not have all the relevant information, it cannot achieve this object.’: Davies v Eli Lilly &amp; Co [1987] All ER 801, 804.\n\n\nLimits on discovery\n\nLimitations in Supreme Court Equity Division as per Practice Note SC Eq 11:\n\nCourt will not make an order for disclosure of documents unless there are exceptional circumstances necessitating disclosure.\nOnly make order where necessary for the resolution of the real issues in dispute in the proceedings.\nAny application for an order for disclosure must be supported by an affidavit.\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery\n\nThere are two main forms of discovery:\n\n\n\nPreliminary discovery (before proceedings commence): UCPR Pt 5; and\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery proper (after proceedings commence): UCPR Pt 21.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreliminary discovery\n\nPreliminary discovery available to:\n\n\n\nAscertain identity or whereabouts of prospective defendants (r 5.2); or\n\n\n\n\nTo assess whether or not to commence proceedings (r 5.3).\n\n\nIf proceedings not yet commenced – file summons with supporting affidavit, personally serve application and affidavit (rr 5.2, 5.3, 5.4).\nCourt can order costs relating to preliminary discovery (r 5.8).\n\n\nPreliminary discovery – ascertain identity or whereabouts\n\nr 5.2 – two main criteria:\n\n\n\nApplicant is unable to locate or identify prospective defendant after making reasonable inquiries; and\n\n\n\n\nSome other person may have information, or possess documents, that tend to assist locating or identifying defendant.\n\n\n\n\nNB – applicant must “desire” to commence proceedings against the person: Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales v Care Park Pty Limited [2012] NSWCA 35.\n\n\nPreliminary discovery – whether or not to commence proceedings\n\nr 5.3 is cast in much the same language as r 5.2:\n\n\n\nApplicant may have claim against another person, but has been unable to obtain sufficient information to decide whether to commence after having made reasonable inquiries, and\n\n\n\n\nSuch a person may have or have had possession of a document or thing that can assist in determining whether or not the applicant is entitled to make a claim, and\n\n\n\n\nInspection of such a document would assist the applicant to make the decision.\n\n\n\n\nKey difference to r 5.2 is that it applies only to production of documents, not cross-examining people in court.\nSee Pfizer Ireland Pharmaceuticals v Samsung Bioepis AU Pty Ltd [2017] FCAFC 193\n\n\nPreliminary discovery - application\n\nIf proceedings not yet commenced, preliminary discovery is sought through a summons supported by an affidavit – r 6.4(1)(c).\nThe affidavit will have to demonstrate how the order is appropriate in the circumstances given the rules i.e. reasonable inquiries have been made, another person possess information or documents that might assist etc.\n\n\nDiscovery and notices to produce\n\nPt 21 of the UCPR provides for:\n\n1.Discovery, where you are seeking documents within a class or classes of documents or samples of documents within a class from the other party; and\n2.Notices to produce, where one party requires another party to produce specific documents\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery (limits)\n\nDiscovery pertains to documents – this is construed broadly e.g. it can include text messages, emails, webpages etc.\nTo be discoverable, a document has to be ‘relevant to a fact in issue’ – r 21.2(4).\nScope of discovery limited by reference to the overriding purpose, s 56 CPA. Parties can no longer seek general discovery.\nNB – as per r 21.7, discovered documents cannot be disclosed\nr 21.3: party subject to an order for discovery complies by serving on the requesting party a list dealing with all of the documents (other than excluded documents) referred to in the order.\nr 21.5: party rendering discovery has to make the documents available for inspection (generally within 21 days of the list being served).\nDiscovery not once-and-for-all – an ongoing obligation.\nDiscovery is verified by affidavit, together with solicitor’s certificate of advice (if appropriate): r 21.4.\n\n\nNotice to produce\n\nParty can serve notice to produce any specified document or thing on another party (r 21.10).\nParty served with notice needs to provide inspection of the document or thing within a reasonable time (usually 14 days).\nMust be answered or an application to be excused from answering it made under r 21.11.\nDocuments called for must be relevant to a fact in issue (r 21.9 (2))\n\n\n\n\nSubpoenas\n\nWhat is a subpoena?\n\nAccording to r 33.1, a “subpoena” means an order in writing requiring the addressee:\n\n(a) to attend to give evidence (a subpoena to attend), or\n(b) to produce the subpoena or a copy of it and a document or thing (a subpoena to produce), or\n(c) to do both of those things.’\n\n\n\n\nFormal requirements for a subpoena\n\nr 33.3 specifies some formal requirements for subpoenas:\n\n(1) A subpoena must be in the approved form.\n(2) A subpoena must not be addressed to more than one person.\n(3) Unless the court orders otherwise, a subpoena must identify the addressee by name or by description of office or position.\n(4) A subpoena to produce must:\n\n(a) identify the document or thing to be produced, and\n(b) specify the date, time and place for production.\n\n\n(5) A subpoena to attend to give evidence must specify the date, time and place for attendance.\nNB – subpoena must be personally served on address – r 33.5.\n\n\n\n\nSubpoenas and conduct money\n\nr 33.6(1):\n\n“An addressee need not comply with the requirements of a subpoena to attend to give evidence unless conduct money has been handed or tendered to the addressee a reasonable time before the date on which attendance is required.\n\n\nWhat is conduct money?\n\nr 33.1 states that “conduct money” means a sum of money or its equivalent, such as pre-paid travel, sufficient to meet the reasonable expenses of the addressee of attending court as required by the subpoena and returning after so attending.”\n\n\n\n\nNotice to admit\n\nThe ‘requesting party’ sends a notice to admit to the ‘admitting party’. The notice requests that the admitting party make certain admissions in favour of the requesting party. The admitting party has 14 days to respond. (rr 17.3, 17.4). Often used where you have facts that are material and relevant to a party’s case, but are not seriously in dispute\nCan go not only to facts but authenticity of documents.\nIf the party does not admit, and the facts are then proved at trial, that party has to bear the costs of such proof.\nPacific Steel Constructions Pty Ltd v Barahona [2009] NSWCA 406 at [153]\n\n\nInterrogatories\n\nParty or its representative is required to answer in writing, and usually on oath, specific questions prior to the trial.\nMust obtain an order from the court requiring answers to specified interrogatories (r 22.1)\nApplication for an order for interrogatories may be made at any time and must be accompanied by a copy of the proposed interrogatories (r 22.1(2))\nCourt won’t make order unless satisfied order is necessary at the time it is made (r 22.1(4))\n\n\nObjection to produce documents founded on privilege\n\nObjections to production of documents and answering of questions founded on privilege (r 1.9).\nClient legal privilege does not mean the document need not be discovered, it is simply listed as a document that does not have to be produced for inspection.\nMasking or redacting privileged parts of a document.\n\n\n\n\nProcedure - Textbook\n\nRoads &amp; Traffic Authority of NSW v Australian National Car Parks Pty Ltd (2007) 47 MVR 502; [2007] NSWCA 114\n\nJurisdiction:\n\nNew South Wales Court of Appeal\n\n\nProcedural History:\n\nLocal Court magistrate ordered RTA to provide preliminary discovery to Australian National Car Parks Pty Ltd (ANCP) under UCPR r 5.2. RTA appealed.\n\n\nOriginal Dispute:\n\nANCP operates car parks, requires tickets or passes.\nSeeks to sue entrants who parked without compliance, based on Conditions of Entry.\n\n\nMaterial Facts:\n\nANCP knows registration numbers and parking dates of 294 vehicles, aims to claim liquidated damages for contract breach.\n\n\nIssue:\n\nWhether RTA should provide preliminary discovery of vehicle owners to ANCP.\n\n\nLaw/Statute in Contention:\n\nUCPR r 5.2;\nRoad Transport (Vehicle Registration) Act 1997;\nFreedom of Information Act 1982 (now Government Information (Public Access) Act 2009 (NSW)).\n\n\nPrecedence:\n\nNorwich Pharmacal Co v Commissioner of Customs and Excise Commissioners [1974] AC 133 considered for discovery principles.\n\n\nJudicial Opinions and Interpretation:\n\nMASON P, with MCCOLL JA and BELL J agreeing, outlined UCPR r 5.2’s application:\n\non notice,\nsupported by affidavit,\nand intended litigation.\nEmphasized reasonable inquiries and potential assistance of information for litigation.\n\n\n\n\nLegal Reasoning and Ratio Decidendi:\n\nThe court held that preliminary discovery under UCPR r 5.2 can be granted when the applicant made reasonable inquiries and the information sought tends to assist in ascertaining the defendant’s identity or whereabouts.\nThe availability of other information ascertainment means (e.g., FOI Act) does not negate the reasonableness of seeking an alternative remedy under UCPR r 5.2.\n\n\nResult:\n\nAppeal dismissed.\nRTA ordered to provide preliminary discovery to ANCP.\n\n\nRelevance to Modern Law:\n\nThis case illustrates the application of UCPR r 5.2 in obtaining preliminary discovery for the purpose of litigation, reinforcing the principle that discovery can be ordered when it tends to assist in identifying prospective defendants, provided reasonable inquiries have been made.\n\n\n\n\nRoads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales v Care Park Pty Limited [2012] NSWCA 35\n\nJurisdiction:\n\nNew South Wales Court of Appeal\n\n\nProcedural History:\n\nA Local Court Magistrate ordered the RTA to give preliminary discovery of the registered owners of 1,397 vehicle license plates to Care Park Pty Ltd under UCPR r 5.2.\nAn appeal to a single Supreme Court judge (Adams J) failed, prompting an appeal to the Court of Appeal.\nA five-judge bench reviewed the case due to RTA’s contention that the 2007 RTA case was wrongly decided.\n\n\nOriginal Dispute:\n\nCare Park operates car parks and sought information on the registered owners of certain vehicles that violated parking conditions, for potential breach of contract lawsuits.\n\n\nMaterial Facts:\n\nCare Park required discovery to identify vehicle owners for legal action regarding parking violations, similar to the circumstances in a previous RTA case.\n\n\nIssue:\n\nInterpretation and application of UCPR r 5.2 concerning the threshold for granting preliminary discovery.\n\n\nLaw/Statute in Contention:\n\nUniform Civil Procedure Rules (UCPR) r 5.2, related to preliminary discovery.\n\n\nJudicial Opinions and Interpretation:\n\nThe Court considered three interpretations of UCPR r 5.2, focusing on whether Care Park needed to demonstrate an intention to commence proceedings against the vehicle owners.\nThe RTA advocated for a strict interpretation requiring a clear purpose to sue, while Care Park argued for a more flexible approach.\n\n\nLegal Reasoning and Ratio Decidendi:\n\nThe Court favored a practical and non-technical approach (Interpretation A), rejecting the need for a fixed intention to sue as a prerequisite for preliminary discovery.\nIt emphasized the rule’s purpose to assist parties lacking sufficient information to commence proceedings.\nThe decision clarified that the desire to bring proceedings, even if conditional, satisfies the rule’s requirements.\n\n\nResult:\n\nThe appeal was dismissed, upholding the decision to grant preliminary discovery to Care Park.\nThe Court affirmed the practical application of UCPR r 5.2, facilitating preliminary discovery when parties intend to pursue legal action but lack necessary information.\n\n\nRelevance to Modern Law:\n\nThis case clarifies the application of UCPR r 5.2 on preliminary discovery in NSW, particularly regarding the threshold requirements for proving an intention or desire to commence legal proceedings.\nIt underscores the court’s discretion in facilitating access to information necessary for potential legal actions, without demanding a definite intention to sue at the discovery stage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocument Discovery\n\nPalavi v Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd [2011] NSWCA 264 (8 September 2011\nJurisdiction:\n\nNew South Wales Court of Appeal\n\n\nProcedural History:\n\nPlaintiff sued 2UE for defamation regarding her sexual conduct with rugby league players.\n2UE’s defense included truth, requiring discovery of phones with incriminating content.\nThe primary judge struck out two imputations due to the plaintiff’s failure in discovery obligations.\nThe plaintiff appealed.\n\n\nMaterial Facts:\n\nPlaintiff’s non-compliance with discovery obligations by not producing mobile phones believed to contain relevant evidence.\n\n\nIssue:\n\nWhether failure to comply with discovery obligations justifies striking out parts of the plaintiff’s claim.\n\n\nLaw/Statute in Contention:\n\nPrinciples surrounding consequences of evidence destruction; Civil Procedure Act’s influence on procedural law in NSW.\n\n\nPrecedence:\n\nReference to Clark v New South Wales for principles on evidence destruction;\nrecognition of the Civil Procedure Act in shaping procedural obligations.\n\n\nJudicial Opinions and Interpretation:\n\nThe court upheld that the power to dismiss or strike out claims for failure to comply with discovery is to be used sparingly, focusing on whether a fair trial can occur without the destroyed evidence.\nEmphasized the statutory duty under the Civil Procedure Act for parties to assist in the justice process.\n\n\nLegal Reasoning and Ratio Decidendi:\n\nDeliberate destruction or non-compliance with discovery obligations that impairs the other party’s case can be grounds for striking out claims.\nThis action aligns with duties under the Civil Procedure Act to ensure the just, quick, and cheap resolution of disputes.\n\n\nResult:\n\nAffirmation of the primary judge’s decision to strike out two imputations from the plaintiff’s claim due to deliberate non-compliance with discovery obligations, constituting an abuse of process.\n\n\nRelevance to Modern Law:\n\nThis case highlights the judiciary’s discretion in dealing with non-compliance with discovery obligations, especially in the context of the Civil Procedure Act, emphasizing the balance between party obligations and the integrity of the judicial process.\n\n\nThe discovery process\n\nThe process for discovery under the UCPR can be summarised as follows (Party A is the party receiving discovery and Party B is the party giving discovery):\n\n\n\nParty A files and serves a notice of motion (with supporting affidavit) seeking discovery from Party B pursuant to UCPR r 21.2.\n\n\nThe notice of motion will specify the order for discovery of documents within a class or classes of documents or samples of documents within a class (r 21.2).\nA “class of documents” is defined by relevance to the facts in issue, or by the type of documents within a class, or in “such other manner as the court considers appropriate in the circumstances” (r 21.3).\n\n\n\n\nThe notice of motion is heard (this is an interlocutory hearing) and the court may order discovery of documents within a class or classes of documents or samples of documents within a class (r 21.2).\n\n\nThe court does not order general discovery.\n\n\n\n\nWithin 28 days of the order (or as the order specifies), Party B prepares a list of documents (r 21.3) which is divided into two parts (documents in the possession of Party B and documents which were in possession of Party B in the last six months).\n\n\nThe list needs to describe the documents. The list also states whether privilege is claimed in respect of the documents and the circumstances that give rise to privilege being claimed.\nIf the documents are not in the possession of Party B then Party B needs to indicate who he or she believes has possession of the documents.\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery does not apply to an “excluded document” (see definition in r 21.1), but note the court may declare a document not to be an excluded document.\n\n\n“Excluded documents” do not have to be included in the list (r 21.3(1)).\n\n\n\n\nThe list must be accompanied by a supporting affidavit by Party B (r 21.4(2)) and a solicitor’s certificate of advice (r 21.4(3)).\n\n\nThe affidavit deposed by Party B verifies the list 662 and must state the specific matters listed in r 21.4(2).\nThe solicitor’s certificate of advice must state the matters set out in r 21.4(3) namely that the solicitor has advised Party B as to the obligations arising under an order for discovery and the solicitor is not aware of documents that are not on the list.\n\n\n\n\nParty B then makes the documents “readily accessible and capable of convenient inspection” for Party A (r 21.5).\n\n\n\n\nThere is a continuing obligation on Party B to make available subsequently discovered documents (r 21.6).\n\n\nThis means that documents which become known after discovery has been carried out are to be made available to Party A.\nPrivileged documents that cease to be privileged also need to be made available.\n\n\n\n\nExcept with the court’s leave (permission), no information from a document obtained as a result of discovery is to be disclosed, or used in other legal proceedings.\n\n\nThe exception to this rule is if the document has been received into evidence in open court (r 21.7).\n\n\n\n\nThe court will not order discovery in personal injury cases unless the court “for special reasons” orders otherwise (r 21.8). Special reasons will exist if discovery is necessary for a fair trial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvidence Types\n\nClient evidence types\n\nWitness statements\n\nBecomes effidence once testimony is sworn-in\n\n\nAffidavits\n\nMust be before qualified witness\n\n\nExpert evidence\n\n\nDefendant evidence types\n\nNotice to produce\n\nNotice to produce for inspection\n\nRequest to provide original document for inspection - mentioned in pleadings - must be relevant\nVery specific\n\n\nNotice to produce for court\n\nDocument needs to be produced to be admitted as evidence to court\nMust be submitted to use as evidence after notice to produce for inspection\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery\n\nDiscovery Test\n\nRelevance to one or more facts or issues\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThird party evidence types\n\nSubpoena\n\nOrder of the court\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice Note SC Eq 11 Disclosure in the Equity Division\n\nDisclosure in the Equity Division\n\nCommencement\n\n\n\nThis Practice Note was issued on 22 March 2012 and commences on 26 March 2012.\n\n\n\n\nApplication\n\n2.

and discussion.\n\nAssisted Review introduces another related metric called overturn rate.\n\nAn overturn occurs when the category in which Assisted Review places a document is changed or overturned by a subject matter expert upon review, i.e. when a responsive document is found to be non-responsive or vice versa\n\n\n\n\nProduction – Delivering ESI to others in appropriate forms and using appropriate delivery mechanisms.\nPresentation – Displaying ESI before audiences (at depositions, hearings, trials, etc), especially in native and near-native forms, to elicit further information, validate existing facts or positions, or persuade an audience\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology assisted review (TAR) def\n\nhas been defined as “[a] process for Prioritizing or Coding a Collection of Documents using a computerized system that harnesses human judgments of one or more Subject Matter Expert(s) on a smaller set of Documents and then extrapolates those judgments to the remaining Document\n\nIn the review stage, TAR examines ESI for relevance, and in the analysis stage may be able to evaluate the ESI for other characteristics such as privilege or particular issues or topics\n\n\n\n\nMcConnell Dowell Constructors v Santam (2016) 51 VR 42\n\nJurisdiction:\n\nVictoria, Australia\n\n\nContext:\n\nThe case involved a claim related to the design and construction of a natural gas pipeline in Queensland.\nThe complexity of the case was marked by the vast volume of electronic or PDF documents generated during the construction contract and an associated arbitration, amounting to approximately 4 million documents, reduced to about 1.4 million deemed relevant for the proceedings.\n\n\nIssue:\n\nThe feasibility and permissibility of employing predictive coding or technology-assisted review (TAR) for document discovery in a large-scale litigation context.\n\n\nKey Points:\n\nTraditional manual discovery processes were deemed impractical and disproportionate due to the massive volume of documents and the associated costs.\nThe court considered the application of predictive coding (TAR), a method involving the use of software to “train” a computer to recognize and categorize documents as relevant or not based on concepts relevant to the issues in the proceeding.\n\n\nLegal Precedents and Comparative Analysis:\n\nThe court referred to several international cases, including Pyrrho Investments Ltd v MWB Property Ltd [2016] from the UK, highlighting the acceptance and endorsement of TAR in other jurisdictions.\nThe TAR process is detailed as being more sophisticated and potentially more accurate than manual review, with studies cited indicating that TAR might lead to higher accuracy in identifying relevant documents.\n\n\nRationale:\n\nPredictive coding was seen as a cost-effective and proportionate approach to discovery in cases involving large data sets, supported by evidence of its accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional manual review.\nThe process involves initial training of the software with a representative sample of documents, followed by rounds of quality assurance exercises to validate the software’s categorization decisions.\n\n\nJudicial Opinion:\n\nThe court endorsed the use of predictive coding in the McConnell Dowell case, aligning with international trends and recognizing the necessity of employing technology to manage discovery efficiently in large document cases.\nThe decision was underpinned by a broader consideration of the principles of proportionality and the need to conduct discovery in a way that is both cost-effective and conducive to the fair resolution of disputes.\n\n\nRelevance to Modern Law:\n\nThis case marks a significant acknowledgment within the Australian legal system of the utility and acceptability of TAR in managing discovery processes in complex litigation.\nIt reflects a shift towards integrating technological solutions in legal procedures to address the challenges posed by digital documentation and large-scale data analysis.\n\n\n\n\nSubpoena\n\nWaind v Hill &amp; National Employers Mutual General Association Ltd [1978] 1 NSWLR 372 at 381\n\nMoffitt P set out the three stages arising in respect of a subpoena to produce\n\nThe first is obeying the subpoena, by the witness bringing the documents to the court and handing them to the judge.\nThe second step is the decision of the judge concerning the preliminary use of the documents, which includes whether or not permission should be given to a party or parties to inspect the documents.\nThe third step is the admission into evidence of the document in whole or in part; or the use of it in the process of evidence being put before the court by cross-examination or otherwise.\n\nIt is the third step which alone provides material upon which ultimate decision in the case rests.\n\n\n\n\nNOW UCPR r 33.4\n\n\nGrounds for setting aside a subpoena to produce\n\nA subpoena can be set aside, whole or in part, on the grounds that it is an abuse of process because of the following:\n\nA subpoena cannot be used as a substitute for discovery:\n\nThe Commissioner for Railways v Small (1938) 38 SR 654 at 574 and NSW Commissioner of Police v Tuxford [2002] NSWCA 139 at [19] (see [12.410]).\nAn issuing party is “not entitled to procure the issue of the subpoena for the purpose of fishing, that is, endeavouring not to obtain evidence to support their case, but to discover whether they had a case at all, or to discover the nature of the case of the defendant”:\n\n[2002] NSWCA 139 at [27].\n\n\n\n\nA subpoena cannot be oppressive. A subpoena may be oppressive if it has insufficient particularisation of the documents called for.\n\nThis creates oppression because the recipient is required to judge what documents are caught by the subpoena.\nA subpoena could also be oppressive where compliance is too onerous.\n\nThis is demonstrated where an excessive burden is placed on the producing party, for example, in NSW Commissioner of Police v Tuxford (see [12.410]).\n\n\nTuxford called for all “originals or copies” of documents that were located in many locations. This was found to be oppressive.\n\n\n\n\nA subpoena cannot have an improper purpose.\n\nFor example, the subpoena may seek documents not for the purpose of the litigation but for some spurious purpose such as a private purpose or for use in other proceedings.\n\n\nAn absence of the apparent relevance of documents is a sufficient ground to have it set aside, see Trade Practices Commission v Arnotts Limited (No 2) (1989) 21 FCR 306.\nA subpoena must have a legitimate forensic purpose: see [12.400].\nA subpoena which is an abuse of process may be set aside before the recipient is put to the trouble of gathering the documents sought: NSW Commissioner of Police v Tuxford [2002] NSWCA 139 at [21]\n\n\nDrafting affidavits\n\nThe approved form for an affidavit is Form 40\nJudges and legal practitioners have also provided suggestions as to best practice for drafting affidavits which include:2\n\nidentify the deponent and their relationship to the dispute;\nset out the matters in the affidavit in a logical manner – this may or may not be a chronological sequence;\nuse the witness’s own words;\nconversations should be stated in direct speech, that is, the first person – I said, she said;\nstate facts the witness has personal and actual knowledge of, not opinions or assumptions unless the affidavit is for an expert witness;\nbe concise but complete;\nuse headings and in longer affidavits, a table of contents;\navoid irrelevant material;\navoid hearsay, except in interlocutory applications, as an affidavit must be confined to facts the witness can prove from direct knowledge; and\navoid making submissions or arguments\n\n\nRevised Professional Conduct and Practice Rules 1995 (Solicitors’ Rules) rule 17\n\n\nYing v Song [2010] NSWSC 1500\ndispute between former family members over shares in the second defendant (Budget Scaffold Supplies Pty Ltd, to which I will refer as BSS) and in respect of amounts recorded at one stage in the financial records of BSS as a shareholder loan from the plaintiff (Ming Ying) to the company.\nMing Ying’s sister (Hua Ying) was formerly married to the first defendant (Lida Song).\n\nThere are Family Court proceedings presently on foot between the couple\nAccording to Ming Ying, he paid some $106,025 to acquire shares in BSS, shares which Lida Song later transferred back to himself, without Ming Ying’s consent, in 2005.\nAccording to Lida Song, however, the shares were only transferred to Ming Ying (and the company’s records recorded shareholder loans by Ming Ying) as part of an attempt to present a false impression of Ming Ying’s assets in Australia to the Department of Immigration so as to assist in Ming Ying’s attempt to obtain permanent residency in Australia\n\n\nmuch of the later affidavit evidence must have been prepared by cutting and pasting material from Mr Ying’s earlier affidavits – even material that had in the interim been corrected by other affidavits sworn by Mr Ying\n\nThis may diminish the reliability and hence the weight to be accorded to that evidence (on any of the various versions).\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 8: Interlocutory Applications and Injunctions\n\nThe court has power to order a plaintiff to give security for the defendant’s cost of defending the plaintiff’s claim and can order a stay of proceedings until the security is given\ns r 2.1 and r 42.21 of the UCPR, s 67 of the CPA and, in respect of corporations, from s 1335 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).\nWollongong City Council v Legal Business Centre Pty Limited [2012] NSWCA 245\n\nJurisdiction:\n\nNew South Wales Court of Appeal -

Exceptions found in r 18.2(2).\n\n\nWhat must a notice of motion contain?\n\nr 18.3 spells out some of the things a notice of motion must do, including:\n\nIdentifying the person seeking the order;\nIdentifying each person affected by the order;\nIf a person is not already a party, it must state an address for service; and\nThe notice must also state concisely the nature of the proposed order.\n\n\n\n\nNotices of motion – some more requirements\n\nr 18.4: unless the court orders otherwise, a notice of motion must be served at least 3 days before the date fixed for the motion.\nr 18.5: a notice of motion must be personally served if the person on whom it is to be served is not a party to the proceedings or is not an active party (i.e. they haven’t entered an appearance).\nr 18.7: if you have served the notice of motion in accordance with the rules, and the other party doesn’t turn up, then the Court can deal with the motion in their absence.\n\n\n\nPro forma notice of motion\n\nSome types of interlocutory orders\n\nSecurity for costs;\nInterlocutory injunctions;\nA Mareva order, also known as a freezing order; and\nAn Anton Piller order, also known as a search order.\n\n\nSecurity for costs\n\nWhat is a security for costs? An order whereby the defendant applies to the court asking for the plaintiff to provide some kind of security for the payment of costs in the event that the plaintiff fails in their proceedings.\nr 42.21: 6 circumstances in which a security may apply:\n\nWhere plaintiff is ordinarily resident outside Australia;\nWhere address of plaintiff is misstated or omitted from originating process, and reason to believe this was done with intention to deceive;\nWhere plaintiff has changed their address, and reason to believe this was done to\navoid the consequences of the proceedings;\nIf there is reason to believe that a corporation won’t be able to pay the defendant’s costs e.g. because it is bankrupt;\nWhere the plaintiff is suing for someone else’s benefit and appears unable to pay for defendants costs; and\nIf there is reason to believe that the plaintiff has divested assets with intention of avoiding consequences of proceedings.\n\n\nr 42.21(1B): if the plaintiff is a natural person, a security can’t be imposed simply because they are impecunious.\nr 42.21(1A) lists the many different factors that the Court can take into account in weighing the interests of the plaintiff and the defendant. Some are:\n\n(a) the prospects of success or merits of the proceedings;\n(b) the genuineness of the proceedings;\n(d) whether the plaintiff’s impecuniosity is attributable to the defendant’s conduct;\n(f) whether an order for security for costs would stifle the proceedings; and\n(g) whether the proceedings involves a matter of public importance.\n\n\n\n\nInjunctions\n\nInjunction: a court order of an equitable nature requiring a person to do, or refrain from doing, a particular action.\nInjunctions can come in various shapes:\n\nMandatory injunction: order requiring a party to act;\nProhibitory injunction: order requiring a party to refrain from acting;\nInterim injunction: order in force for a short period of time; and\nFinal or perpetual injunction: order finally determines rights of parties.\n\n\nInjunctions are creatures of equity. Today the powers of the NSW Supreme Court to grant injunctions are codified in s 66 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW).\nThere is also provision made under part 25 of UCPR for a range of injunctions, including in relation to:\n\nThe preservation of property (r 25.3);\nThe sale of property where the property is likely to deteriorate or perish (r 25.4);\nThe interim distribution of property or income rr (25.5-6);\nAn urgent matter prior to the commencement of proceedings (r 25.2(c)).\n\n\n\n\nThe usual undertaking as to damages\n\nApplies for interlocutory injunctions, Mareva orders and Anton Piller orders.\nr 25.8: with the usual undertaking as to damages, the plaintiff submits to give compensation to another party (it could be the defendant, it could be someone else) due to the operation of the interlocutory order.\nIf the court determines at trial that the injunction shouldn’t have been made, it conducts an inquiry as to damages, which the plaintiff then has to cover as part of the usual undertaking.\n\n\nTwo criteria for an interlocutory injunction\n\nAn applicant must establish (Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O’Neill (2006) 227 CLR 57):\n\n\n\nA prima facie case in relation to the substantive litigation; and\n\n\n\n\nBalance of convenience: weighing relative inconvenience and injury of plaintiff and defendant.\n\n\n\n\nWhat does the ‘balance of convenience’ entail?

and\n\n\n\n\nWhether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused supposing the decision to be wrong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMareva orders\n\nA Mareva order is a special type of order restraining the defendant from dealing with the whole or part of their assets pending the outcome of proceedings.\nDesigned to prevent a defendant abusing the processes of the court by hiding or dissipating their assets in order to frustrate the ability of the plaintiff to recover damages\nHistorically, Mareva orders stemmed from the Court’s inherent jurisdiction.\n\nThey got their name from the case of Mareva Compania Naviera SA v International Bulkcarriers SA (The Mareva) [1980] 1 All ER 213.\nToday, Mareva orders are also provided for by UCPR Pt 25 Div 2 and Practice Note SC Gen 14: Supreme Court – Freezing Orders.\ncl 6 of Practice Note SC Gen 14 confirms that a freezing order is an extraordinary remedy.\n\n\n\n\nMareva orders – when are they appropriate?\n\nr 25.14: Mareva orders can be made if two criteria are fulfilled:\n\n(1): a judgment has been given in favour of the applicant or an applicant has a good arguable case; and\n(4): “(a) the judgment debtor, prospective judgment debtor or another person absconds.\n(b) the assets of the judgment debtor, prospective judgment debtor or another person are:\n\n(i) removed from Australia or from a place inside or outside Australia, or\n(ii) disposed of, dealt with or diminished in value.”\n\n\n\n\nr 25.14(5): Mareva orders can be sought against third-parties, but stricter criteria apply.\n\n\nAn application for a Mareva order\n\nAn application for a Mareva order is made by way of a motion supported by an affidavit.\nAccording to cl 20 of Practice Note SC Gen 14, the affidavit has to attest to a few things, including:\n\nThe basis of the claim for substantive relief;\nThe amount of the claim;\nIf the application is made ex parte, then the applicant has to include in it their knowledge of any possible defence;\nThe applicant also has to include their knowledge of the nature and value of the respondent’s assets;\nThe affidavit has to include the matters referred to in r 25.14; and\nThe affidavit has to reveal the identity of any person, other than the respondent, who the applicant believes may be affected by the order, and how they may be affected.\n\n\nApplicant is to give usual undertaking as to damages: cl 16 of Supreme Court Practice Note 14.\n\nExtreme care needed in making such an order.\nValue of the assets covered by a Mareva order should not exceed the likely maximum amount of the applicant’s claim and order should exclude dealings by the respondent with its assets for legitimate purposes: Practice Note cl 11, 12.\nEx parte Mareva orders generally only for short period of time so respondent has opportunity to be heard: Practice Note cl 9.\nOperate in personam (i.e. does not attach to the property itself).\n\n\n\n\nAnton Piller orders\n\nAn Anton Piller order (often known as a ‘search order’) compels the defendant to allow the plaintiff or its agents to inspect their property and premises, and allows for the search, preservation and seizure of documents and other evidence.\nDerive their name from Anton Piller KG v Manufacturing Processes Ltd [1976] 1 All ER 779.\nInitially derived from the Court’s inherent jurisdiction, but now find expression in Pt 25 Div 3 of the UCPR and Practice Note SC Gen 13 Supreme Court – Search Orders.\n\n\nThree essential criteria for the grant of an Anton Piller order\n\nr 25.20 specifies that for a search order to be granted, there needs to be:\n\n\n\nA strong prima facie case;\n\n\n\n\nA potential or actual loss or damage to the applicant that will be serious if the order is not made; and\n\n\n\n\nSufficient evidence both that the respondent possesses important evidentiary material and that there is a real possibility that they might destroy such material or cause it to be unavailable for use in evidence.\n\n\nSee Austress Freyssinet Pty Ltd v Joseph [2006] NSWSC 77\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplication for an Anton Piller order\n\nAn application for an Anton Piller order is made by way of motion supported by affidavit.\nAccording to cl 8 of Practice Note SC Gen 13 Supreme Court, the affidavit in support must:\n\nDescribe the things in relation to which the order is sought;\nState the address of the premises to be searched, including whether these are private or business premises;\nOutline why the order is sought, including why there is a real possibility that the evidence will be destroyed or made unavailable;\nDetail the prejudice, loss or damage likely to be suffered by the applicant if the order is not made;\nThe name, address, firm and commercial litigation experience of an independent solicitor who consents to serving the order and supervising its execution; and\nLastly, if the premises to be searched are or include residential premises, the applicant has to state whether or not they believe that the only occupant of the premises is likely to be a female, a child under the age of 18, or a “vulnerable” person.\n\n\n\n\nIndependent solicitors\n\nAccording to cl 11 of Practice Note SC Gen 13 Supreme Court, an independent solicitor supervising an order is an important safeguard against abuse.\nIndependent solicitors:\n\nCan’t be a member or employee of the applicant’s firm of solicitors;\nShould be a solicitor experienced in commercial litigation, preferably in the execution of search orders.\n\n\nHave a number of important functions spelled out in cl 11.\n\n\nAnton Piller orders – some other characteristics\n\nVarious clauses of Practice Note SC Gen 13 Supreme Court:\n\ncl 6: the search party has to include the independent solicitor plus a solicitor or solicitors representing the applicant. It may be necessary that it include other, more specialised persons e.g. an independent computer expert.\ncl 7: an “order should be clear about the maximum number of persons permitted to be in the search party.\n\nThe number of people in the search party should be as small as is reasonably practicable.”\n\n\ncl 18: just like Mareva orders, the making of a search order will usually be made contingent upon the applicant giving the usual undertaking as to damages.\n\n\n\n\nObligation of candour\n\nInjunctions, Mareva orders and Anton Piller orders are often sought urgently on an ex parte basis.\n\nThe absence of the other party is countervailed through the applicant’s obligation of candour.\nThe obligation of candour is an obligation to bring to th court’s attention all the material facts, even if those facts are detrimental to the applicant’s case.\n\n\nIncludes raising all the relevant matters which would have been raised by the opposing party if he or she had been present.\nApplies even if non-disclosure was inadvertent.\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 9: Costs and Settlement\n\nCosts and Settlement\n\nWhat are costs?\n\nCosts are the actual amounts a party is charged or may be charged for legal services provided by a law practice related to the litigation.\ns 3 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) defines costs as ‘costs payable in or in relation to the proceedings, and includes fees, disbursements, expenses and remuneration.’\n\n\nCosts agreements\n\nPart 4.3 Division 4 of the Legal Profession Uniform Law (NSW) provides for written costs agreements between solicitors and their clients which form the basis of the solicitors’ professional fees.\ns 174: a law practice must:\n\nSpecify the basis on which costs will be calculated e.g. hourly rate; and\nNotify the client of any significant change in costs.\n\n\nCosts agreement can be expressed as being on a conditional basis.\n\n\nOn what basis are costs calculated?\n\nTwo main types of cost bases:\n\n\n\nOrdinary basis:\n\n\nOrdered pursuant to s 98(1)(c) of the CPA.\n“Fair and reasonable amount…for the work concerned”;\ns 76(1) Legal Profession Uniform Law Application Act 2014 (NSW).\nNormally considerably less than expenses actually incurred.\nAlso referred to as ‘standard party and party’ costs.\n\n\n\n\nIndemnity basis:\n\n\nAlso ordered pursuant to s 98(1)(c) of the CPA.\nMore generous than ordinary basis.\nPaying party must prove costs are unreasonable and typically courts allow all costs, save those unreasonably incurred or of an unreasonable amount.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe primary rule in relation to costs\n\nUsually, costs follow the event:\n\nBaulderstone Hornibrook v Gordian Runoff [2006] NSWSC 583.\n\nOther things being equal, the loser has to pay the winner’s costs (the “loser pays” principle). See r 42.1 of the UCPR.\nHowever, courts have broad discretion to order costs: s 98 CPA\nSee also Pt 42 of the UCPR.\nIn exceptional circumstances courts will depart from this principle.\n\n\n\n\nSome general principles when departing from the primary rule\n\nThe most common circumstance in which the presumption that the loser pays may be displaced is evidence of disentitling conduct on the part of the successful party.\nJustice McHugh in the case of Oshlack v Richmond River Council (1998) 193 CLR 72 provided a list of non-exhaustive circumstances which might warrant displacing the loser pays principle.\nThe discretion to award costs against a successful party must be exercised judicially.\nThe onus lies on the losing party to establish a basis for any departure from the usual rule.\n\n\nThe role of costs in managing litigation\n\nCosts help manage litigation in a number of ways:\n\n\n\nThey act as a disincentive to litigation in the first place.\n\n\nAlso, costs orders are very difficult to appeal;\n\n\n\n\nThe general idea of costs following the event plays a regulative role.\n\n\nIdeally, it should ensure that only meritorious proceedings are brought in the first place;\n\n\n\n\nCosts encourage early settlement; and\n\n\n\n\nThey are factor relevant to case management decisions under various sections of the CPA, including ss 56(5), 57(1)(d), 60, 61(3)(f), 62(6).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCosts as a spur to settlement\n\nSettlements ‘encouraged’ by:\n\npenalising those who don’t settle when they should; and\nsupporting institutions designed to ease negotiations.\n\n\nMechanisms of settlement:\n\nCalderbank letters; and\nOffers of compromise under Pt 42 Div 3 of the UCPR.\n\n\n\n\nCalderbank letters\n\nCalderbank v Calderbank [1976] Fam 93 (UK case).\n‘Without prejudice’ letter offering to settle for a sum.\nThey promote settlement of disputes:\n\nMessiter v Hutchinson (1987) 10 NSWLR 525.\n\n\nIndemnity costs may be awarded where “unreasonable” refusal of settlement offer (no prima facie presumption in favour of indemnity costs).\nWas there a genuine offer of compromise? &amp; Was it unreasonable for the offeree not to accept it?: Miwa Pty Ltd v Siantan Properties Pty Ltd (No.2) [2011] NSWCA 344.\n\n\n\nOffers of compromise\n\nAn offer to settle is made by A to B.\n\nB does not accept offer and litigation continues. If B subsequently receives a less favourable judgment than what they would have received under A’s offer, B is usually penalised by adverse costs awards.\n\n\nConceptually related to Calderbank offers except explicitly provided for by the UCPR.\nRegulated by UCPR Part 20 Div 4 and Part 42.\n\n\nOffers of compromise – cost implications\n\nEither party accepts an offer with no provision for costs: party who judgment is in favour of entitled to costs on an ordinary basis to date of acceptance of offer:\n\nUCPR r 42.13A.\n\n\nD does not accept and P does better: P normally awarded indemnity costs from day of offer:\n\nr 42.14.\n\n\nP does not accept D’s offer and P does not do better: P entitled to their costs on the normal basis up to the offer and then has to pay D’s costs on an indemnity basis for period after the offer:\n\nUCPR r 42.15.\n\n\nNB – court can always ‘otherwise order’ if it sees fit:\n\nrr 42.14 &amp; 42.15\n\n\nTable of Costs Scenarios\n\n\n\nOffers of compromise – some technical matters\n\nThe final date for most offers is up to delivery of judgment (or summing up to a jury if there is a jury trial).\nWhere an offer is made two months or more before the date set down for commencement of the trial, the offer must be open for 28 days:\n\nr 20.26(5).\n\n\nDuring the time it is open it can be accepted:\n\nr 20.27.\n\n\nOffers of compromise are ‘without prejudice’:\n\nr 20.26(9).\n\n\nIf a party accepts an offer of compromise and then reneges, then the other party is entitled to judgment or dismissal of the plaintiff’s case, striking out a defendants defence, etc:\n\nr 20.29.\n\n\nAn offer of compromise can be accepted by serving written notice on the offeror any time within the period of acceptance. Once accepted, any party to the offer can enter judgment in accordance with the offer.\n\n\nLeach v The Nominal Defendant [2014] NSWCA 391\n\nCase revolved appellant involved in a motor accident – driver of other car uninsured and unidentified.\nDriver shot at and seriously injured appellant.\nAppellant brings action against nominal defendant, State Insurance Regulatory Authority (SIRA).\nSIRA makes an offer focused solely on costs – Court accepts this is a genuine compromise.\nIf there is a genuine compromise, onus shifts to offeree to show why indemnity costs shouldn’t be levied.\nSometimes seen as offeree demonstrating “exceptional circumstances.”\n\n\nThe legislative framework for costs\n\nThe key provisions surrounding costs are s 98 of the CPA and Pt 42 of the UCPR.\ns 98 CPA:\n\n‘(1) Subject to rules of court and to this or any other Act:\n\n(a) costs are in the discretion of the court, and\n(b) the court has full power to determine by whom, to whom and to what extent costs are to be paid, and\n(c) the court may order that costs are to be awarded on the ordinary basis or on an indemnity basis.’\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UCPR and costs\n\nr 42.1: the general rule is that costs follow the event – but also states: ‘unless it appears to the court that some other order should be made as to the whole or any part of the costs.’\nr 42.2: general rule as to assessment of costs:\n\n‘Unless the court orders otherwise or these rules otherwise provide, costs payable to a person under an order of the court or these rules are to be assessed on the ordinary basis.’\n\n\nr 42.4: Court may give order to fix maximum costs that may be recovered.\nr 42.5: gives a sense of how indemnity costs are levied.\nr 42.6: amendment of pleading etc without leave - must pay costs of amendment.\nr 42.7: the costs for interlocutory applications are dealt with in same way as general costs.\nrr 42.8 &amp;

It provides:\n\n‘(1) The court may at any stage of the proceedings order that the whole or any part of a pleading be struck out if the pleading:\n\n(a) discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence or other case appropriate to the nature of the pleading, or\n(b) has a tendency to cause prejudice, embarrassment or delay in the proceedings, or\n(c) is otherwise an abuse of the process of the court.\n\n\n(2) The court may receive evidence on the hearing of an application for an order under subrule (1).’\n\n\n\n\nr 14.28(1)(a) – discloses no reasonable cause of action/defence\n\nSimilar in some ways to the old demurrer procedure i.e. no evidence is led, it is the wording of the pleading itself.\n“A pleading or part thereof will be struck out if the court is satisfied that even if all the allegations of fact set out in the pleading are proved, those facts would not establish the essential ingredients of a cause of action or constitute a defence”\n\n\nr 14.28(1)(a) – discloses no reasonable cause of action/defence cont.\n\nA hypothetical: a statement of claim alleges a cause of action in negligence and a cause of action in trespass.\nThe facts in the statement all attest to how the plaintiff saw their neighbour routinely jump their fence and come onto their property.\nOne part of the pleading (trespass) can clearly be made out.\nHowever, there is nothing in the facts that could possibly disclose an action in negligence – that part could be struck-out under r 14.28(1)(a).\n\n\nr 14.28(1)(b) – tends to cause prejudice, embarrassment or delay\n\n“A pleading or part thereof may tend to prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the proceedings if it contains allegations which are vague or imprecise such that the other party cannot plead to such allegations specifically, or if it contains allegations that are irrelevant, unnecessary or scandalous”:\nPriest v New South Wales [2006] NSWSC 12\n\n\nr 14.28(1)(c) – abuse of process\n\nCourts have an inherent jurisdiction to prevent the abuse of their processes.\nIn Hunter v Chief Constable of West Midland Police [1982] AC 529, at 536, this power was described as preventing a misuse of the court’s procedure in a way “which, although not inconsistent with the literal application of its procedural rules, would nevertheless be manifestly unfair to a party to litigation before it, or would otherwise bring the administration of justice into disrepute among right-thinking people.”\nAbuse of the process of the court ‘is insusceptible of a formulation comprising closed categories’ -\n\nBatistatos v Road and Traffic Authority NSW (2006) 226 CLR 256.\n\n\nExamples of abuse of process include:\n\nThe institution of proceedings for an improper purpose –\n\nWilliams v Spautz (1992) 174 CLR 509;\n\n\nBringing concurrent proceedings in different courts relating to the same subject-matter –\n\nCommonwealth of Australia v Cockatoo Dockyard Pty Ltd [2003] NSWCA 192;\n\n\nAttempting to re-litigate issues where the principles of res judicata or issue estoppel are applicable –\n\nStokes (by a tutor) v McCourt [2013] NSWSC 1014\n\n\nAttempting to litigate issues which could and should have been litigated in previous proceedings –\n\nPort of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd (1981) 147 CLR 589;\n\n\nClaims that cannot be justly determined e.g. because of delay –\n\nBatistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority (NSW) (2006) 226 CLR 256;\n\n\nModest claims which will involve disproportionate costs and time to determine;\n\nForum non conveniens i.e. there is a more appropriate forum for the proceedings to be heard in; and\n\n\nDestruction of evidence –\n\nPalavi v Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd (2012) 84 NSWLR 523\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourt wary of striking-out pleadings\n\nThe ordinary presumption of the legal system is that people are entitled to their ‘day in Court’.\nThat being the case, the power to strike out pleadings is one the Court will only use sparingly and in clear cases.\n\n\nSummary disposal\n\nSummary disposal is a label used to describe applications to the court that can result in proceedings being concluded before a trial.’:\n\nKumar, Legg, Vickovich &amp; Metzger, Civil Procedure in NSW (4th ed, Thomson Reuters, 2020), 930.\n\n\nPt 13 of the UCPR provides for (amongst other things):\n\nSummary judgment – r 13.1;\nFrivolous and vexatious proceedings (summary dismissal) – r 13.4;\nNon-appearance by the plaintiff – r 13.6\n\n\n\n\nDifference between summary disposal and Strike out\n\n“Unlike UCPR Pt 13, applications under this rule (here it is talking about r 14.28) are directed to the form of the pleading rather than to the merits, or lack thereof, of the respective parties, and if the application is successful the order usually made is not that the proceedings be struck out or dismissed, but that the pleading or particular parts thereof be struck out, usually with leave given to file an amended document (replead), in which case the proceedings remain on foot.\nIf on the other hand, the evidence establishes that, no matter how the plaintiff pleads his or her case, he or she has no arguable cause of action and cannot possibly succeed, the proceedings should be dismissed pursuant to r 13.4”:\n\n\nSummary disposal – summary judgment, r 13.1\n\nr 13.1 provides that:\n\n“(1) If, on application by the plaintiff in relation to the plaintiff’s claim for relief or any part of the plaintiff’s claim for relief:\n\n(a) there is evidence of the facts on which the claim or part of the claim is based, and\n(b) there is evidence, given by the plaintiff or by some responsible person, that, in the belief of the person giving the evidence, the defendant has no defence to the claim or part of the claim, or no defence except as to the amount of any damages claimed,\n\n\nthe court may give such judgment for the plaintiff, or make such order on the claim or that part of the claim, as the case requires.\n\n\n\n\nSummary judgment, r 13.1 – some key points\n\nSome important features of summary judgments include:\n\nIt is a tool for the plaintiff.\nThe plaintiff has to apply for it (by motion under Pt 18 of the UCPR, supported by an affidavit pursuant to Pt 35).\nWhether the Court will grant this remedy depends upon whether the plaintiff can point to the facts which support their claim and can establish that, in their belief or the belief of a responsible person, the defendant has no defence to the claim, or their only defence is as to the damages.\n\nSee Cosmos E-C Comerce v Bidwell [2005] NSWCA 81.\n\n\nThe Court will exercise its discretion to make a summary judgment very cautiously e.g. no triable issues.\n\n\n\n\nSummary dismissal, r 13.4\n\nWhereas summary judgment is for the plaintiff, summary dismissal provides a corresponding right for the defendant.\nRelevant rule is r 13.4:\n\n‘(1) If in any proceedings it appears to the court that in relation to the proceedings generally or in relation to any claim for relief in the proceedings:\n\n(a) the proceedings are frivolous or vexatious, or\n(b) no reasonable cause of action is disclosed, or\n(c) the proceedings are an abuse of the process of the court,\n\n\n\n\nthe court may order that the proceedings be dismissed generally or in relation to that claim.’\n\n\nr 13.4(1)(a) – frivolous or vexatious proceedings\n\nAlthough related, “frivolous” and “vexatious” are conceptually distinct.\n“Material is frivolous where it is without substance, or groundless or fanciful, and it is vexatious where it lacks bona fides and is hopeless or oppressive and tends to cause the opposite side unnecessary anxiety, trouble and expense”\n\n– Bullen and Leake and Jacob’s Precedents of Pleading (12 th ed, Sweet &amp; Maxwell: 1975), 145.\n\n\n\n\nSummary dismissal - procedure\n\nOrdinarily summary disposal will be instigated by an application from the defendant i.e. by way of motion (Pt 18 UCPR) supported by affidavit (Pt 35).\nHOWEVER, remember the general presumption: ”\n\n“Where the court is asked to reject the plaintiff’s case, either under its statutory rules or its inherent jurisdiction, the fundamental principle is that prima facie a plaintiff is entitled to have his case come to trial; and applications to deprive him of that right will succeed only in the clearest of cases…fatal defects in the plaintiff’s case must be very clear before the court will intervene in this fashion”:\nBrimson v Rocla Concrete Pipes Ltd [1982] 2 NSWLR 937, 944.\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) (1964) 112 CLR 125\n\nKey case on summary dismissal/Strike out.\nCase involved the plaintiff alleging patent infringement against the defendants related to the construction of rail carriage bearings.\n\nThe defendants in turn argued this was permitted by ss 125 and 132 of the Patents Act 1952-1960 (Cth).\nBarwick CJ agreed, striking out the plaintiff’s statement of claim and dismissing the proceedings.\n\n\nBarwick CJ: summary dismissal is a drastic step to be taken with great caution. Over the years, that caution has been expressed as only dismissing cases that are:\n\nSo obviously untenable that it couldn’t succeed;\nManifestly groundless;\nSo manifestly faulty that it does not admit of argument or cannot possibly succeed;\nUnder no possibility could there be a good cause of action;\nBe manifest that to allow them would involve useless expense.\nSimilar standard for summary judgment:\n\nCosmos E-C Comerce v Bidwell [2005] NSWCA 81.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nr 13.6 – dismissal where plaintiff fails to appear\n\nr 13.6 provides for the dismissal of proceedings where the plaintiff fails to appear for a hearing that was adjourned because of their absence.\nr 13.6(1): if plaintiff doesn’t turn up for a hearing, then the Court can adjourn to another date.\n\nNot less than five days before that new date, a notice of the adjournment will be served on the plaintiff advising them that if they don’t turn up for this new date, then their proceedings may be dismissed.\n\n\nr 13.6(2): court can dismiss plaintiff’s proceedings if given notice of adjourned hearings.\n\n\nDefault judgments\n\nWhat is a default judgment?\n\n‘A default judgement applies to proceedings commenced by statement of claim…and is a judgment entered by virtue of court rules rather than one ordered by the court.\nA default judgement can be entered if the defendant is in “default”…’: Kumar, Legg, Vickovich &amp; Metzger, Civil Procedure in NSW (4 th ed, Thomson Reuters, 2020), 931.\n\n\nArises in situations of procedural shortcoming defined by r 16.2 e.g. failing to file a defence in time, failing to file any affidavit verifying a defence, having a defence struck out.\n\nr 16.3 is the master rule for default judgments.\nr 16.3(1): plaintiff has to apply for a default judgment.\nr 16.3(2): plaintiff must provide two affidavits in their application:\n\nAffidavit of service; and\nAffidavit in support.\n\n\nr 16.3(1A):\n\napplication for default judgment does not ordinarily need to be served on defendant and can be dealt with in the absence of the parties.\n\n\nNB – the affidavit in support must attest to different things depending upon whether the default judgment is for debt or liquidated damages (r 16.6) or unliquidated damages (r 16.7).\n\n\n\n\nOverturning a default judgment\n\nr 36.16:\n\n‘(2) The court may set aside or vary a judgment or order after it has bee entered if:\n\n(a) it is a default judgment (other than a default judgment given in open court), or\n(b) it has been given or made in the absence of a party, whether or not the absent party had notice of the relevant hearing or of the application for the judgment or order…’\n\n\n\n\nDefendant would seek overturn by way of motion supported by an affidavit.\nThe affidavit would lay out the grounds on which the overturn was sought and that there is a defence to the claim that has merit.\n\nThe fundamental (but not the only) principles guiding a court asked to exercise the unfettered discretion UCPR r 36.16(2)(a) confers, are whether the applicant has a bona fide ground of defence, an adequate explanation for failure to defend and the length of any delay…In the final analysis, it is necessary to consider whether it is in the interests of justice to allow the party seeking to set aside a default judgment to be permitted to defend the proceedings on the merits…’:\n\nDunwoodie v Teachers Mutual Bank Ltd [2014] NSWCA 24, at [43].\n\n\n‘I would only add [to Dunwoodie] that, in my view, in determining whether it is in the interests of justice to allow the party seeking to set aside a default judgment to be permitted to defend the proceedings on the merits, it is appropriate for the Court to consider the relative weight of each of the individual considerations of the strength of any defence, the adequacy of the explanation for the failure to defend proceedings and the length of any delay.\nSo that, for example, although the Court does not embark upon a hearing of the full merits of the case, the existence of what would appear to be a strong defence would warrant a more indulgent approach regarding the adequacy of the explanation for the failure to defend.’\n\nCronau v Vavakis (No 3) [2018] NSWSC 1973, at [5].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDismissal for want of due despatch\n\nr 12.7:\n\n‘(1) If a plaintiff does not prosecute the proceedings with due despatch, the court may order that the proceedings be dismissed or make such other order as the court thinks fit.\n(2) If the defendant does not conduct the defence with due despatch, the court may strike out the defence, either in whole or in part, or make such other order as the court thinks fit.’\n\n\nExamples of things which reflect lack of due despatch can include changing solicitors frequently, seeking many adjournments, not abiding by the correct procedural steps etc -\n\nBuilding Insurers’ Guarantee Corp. v. Daniel Touma &amp; Ors. [2010] NSWSC 4.\n\n\n“The central consideration in a want of prosecution case is whether, at the time when the action is likely to be tried, it will be capable of being tried adequately and fairly”:\n\nMcKenna v McKenna [1984] VR 665, 666.\n\n\nParty seeking dismissal for want of due despatch would apply by way of motion supported by affidavit.\nNB - r 12.8 allows the Supreme Court and Land and Environment Court to dismiss proceedings of their own accord if it appears from the court’s records that, for over 5 months, no party to the proceedings has taken any step in the proceedings.\n\n\nVexatious litigants\n\nVexatious litigants form a very small sub-class of litigants who persistently begin legal actions but don’t have sufficient grounds for doing so.\nAn example is John Wilson, prominent in the Australian sovereign citizen movement.\nFor the purposes of s 6 of the Vexatious Proceedings Act 2008 (NSW), vexatious proceedings include:\n\n‘(a) proceedings that are an abuse of the process of a court or tribunal, and\n(b) proceedings instituted to harass or annoy, to cause delay or detriment, or for another wrongful purpose, and\n(c) proceedings instituted or pursued without reasonable ground, and\n(d) proceedings that are conducted to achieve a wrongful purpose, or in a way that harasses, or causes unreasonable annoyance, delay or detriment, regardless of the subjective intention or motive of the person who instituted the proceedings.’\n\n\nRelevant parts of s 8 of Vexatious Proceedings Act 2008 (NSW):\n\ns 8(1): an order can apply to someone who has “frequently” instituted or conducted vexatious proceedings in Australia, or someone working in concert with such a person.\ns 8(3): the person subject to the order has a right to be heard before that order is made.\ns 8(4): an order can be made on the Court’s own motion, or it can be made on the instigation of the Attorney-General, the Solicitor General, the registrar of the Court, a party against or in relation to whom the litigant has commenced vexatious proceedings, or anyone else possessing a sufficient interest.\ns 8(7): an order can stay any of their current proceedings, or indeed prohibit them from instituting proceedings in NSW at all.\n\n\nRegister of vexatious litigants kept on Supreme Court website:\n\nwww.supremecourt.justice.nsw.gov.au/Pages/sco2_practiceprocedure/SCO2_vexatiousproceedings.aspx#Istherearegisterofvexatiouslitigantsandtheordersthatapplytothem\n\n\nGenerally, those subject to an order are barred from instituting proceedings in NSW unless they seek leave of the Court pursuant to s 14(2) of the Vexatious Proceedings Act 2008 (NSW).\nApplication for leave made by summons supported by an affidavit (s 14(3)), whilst the Court has the discretion to reject or grant the leave (s 14(5)).\n\n\nAttorney General of NSW v Rahman [2014] NSWSC 42\n\nCase centred on Mohammad Rahman, who brought 50 cases in 10 years.\n\nCases centre on a wide variety of matters e.g. English-language test, speeding tickets, social security payments, employment decisions and a suspension from studies as a law student.\nThe 2014 case saw the NSW Attorney-General apply to the Supreme Court to have Mr Rahman designated as a vexatious litigant.\n\n\nJustice Adams drew upon Justice Davies in Attorney General in and for the State of NSW v Gargan [2010] NSWSC 1192 in identifying some key considerations:\n\n‘(a) the test of “frequently” is a less demanding test than was required under s 84 Supreme Court Act 1970;\n(b) the term “frequently” is a relative term and must be looked at in the context of the litigation being considered;\n(c) the number of proceedings considered may be small if the proceedings are an attempt to re-litigate an issue already determined against the person;\n\n\nKey considerations continued:\n\n‘(d) regard may be had to applications made by the person in proceedings commenced against that person;\n(e) regard may be had to the way the person has behaved and conducted himself or herself in the proceedings before the Court;\n(f) regard may be had to proceedings in any Australian court or tribunal;\n(g) regard may be had to the findings and result in the proceedings under consideration.’\n\n\nRemember: “the making of such an order is an extreme remedy depriving its object of recourse to the enforcement of the law which is every citizen’s ordinary right.\n\nIt is, therefore, not lightly to be made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 11: Enforcing Judgments\n\nEnforcing Judgments\n\nWhat is judgment enforcement?\n\n‘Enforcement is the process by which compliance with a determination or order of a court is compelled’: Kumar, Legg, Vickovich &amp; Metzger, Civil Procedure in NSW (4 th ed, Thomson Reuters, 2020), 987.\nEnforcement is pursued by a judgment creditor against a judgment debtor:\n\nJudgment debtor: owes money pursuant to court order.\nJudgment creditor: is owed money pursuant to court order.\n\n\n\n\nDifferent means of enforcement under the UCPR\n\nUniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) Part 39\n\nDivision 1\n\nEnforcement of writs of execution generally\n\n\nDivision 2\n\nEnforcement of writs against land\n\n\nDivision 3\n\nEnforcement of writs against goods etc\n\n\nDivision 4\n\nGarnishee orders\n\n\nDivision 5\n\nCharging orders\n\n\nDivision 6\n\nGeneral\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy should judgment debtors pay in a timely fashion?\n\nJudgment debtors might be tempted to put off paying damages so that inflation whittles away their value.\ns 101 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW):\n\nprovides that judgment debts incur interest until paid.\nInterest payable at the ‘prescribed rate’.\n\n\nNo interest payable if full amount paid within 28 days of judgment.\n\n\nWrits of execution\n\nWrit of execution: court orders addressed to the Sheriff authorising him/her to seize and sell goods, land, money and other assets of a judgment debtor.\nModern writs are descendants of the ancient writ of fieri facia (or fi fa).\nCPA s 102 of the CPA provides defines a writ of execution as:\n\na writ of delivery (s 105);\na writ for the levy of property (s 106); or\na writ of possession (s 104)\n\n\n\n\nHow do you apply for a writ of execution?\n\ns 103 CPA provides that accessing these writs is governed by the UCPR.\nUCPR rr. 39.1, 39.2 &amp; 39.3 – application made by way of notice of motion + supporting affidavit.\n\n\nClasses of judgment\n\nThere are four broad classes of judgment:\n\nThose entitling the successful party to possession of land – s 104 CPA;\nThose requiring the delivery of goods – s 105 CPA;\nThose requiring the payment of money – s 106 CPA; and\nThose involving mandatory or injunctive orders.\n\n\n\n\nWhen is a judgment enforceable?\n\ns 133 CPA: ‘A judgment or order of the court may not be enforced until it has been entered in accordance with the uniform rules.’\nr 36.11(2): ‘Unless the court orders otherwise, a judgment or order is taken to be entered when it is recorded in the court’s computerised court record system.’\ns 17 of the Limitation Act 1969 (NSW): judgment is enforceable for 12 years from when it is entered in the Court records.\n\n\nOrders for examination\n\nOrders for examination may sometimes be necessary to ascertain the financial circumstances of the judgment debtor.\ns 108 CPA:\n\nthe court can order the judgment debtor to attend court to be orally examined and/or to produce documents as to their financial circumstances. Debtor must answer “material questions.”\n\n\nRelevant UCPR rules: rr 38.1 &amp; 38.2\n\n\nJudgment for the payment of money\n\ns 106(1) CPA: judgment for the payment of money can be enforced through three main instruments:\n\nA writ for the levy of property,\nA garnishee order,\nA charging order (in the case of a judgment of the Supreme Court or the District Court).\n\n\n\n\nWrit for the levy of property\n\ns 106(2) CPA: a writ for the levy of property is sufficient authority for the NSW Sheriff to:\n\nTo seize or sell goods which the judgment debtor possessed or is entitled to;\nTo seize money belonging to the judgment debtor;\nTo seize and realise cheques, bills of exchange, promissory notes, bonds, and other securities for money belonging to the debtor;\nTo possess and sell land which the debtor owns or is entitled to;\nTo take and sell choses in action or equitable interests in goods or land held by the debtor.\n\n\ns 106(3): provides limits on what can be taken by Sheriff.\n\n\nWrit for the levy of property cont.\n\nr 39.6(2): regulates the priority in which goods are sold at auction:\n\nIn whatever order the Sheriff deems necessary for the speedy satisfaction of the judgement without undue expense;\nSubject to this, in whatever order the debtor directs;\n\n\nr 39.6(3): land must not be sold before other property unless the judgment debtor requests it.\nNB – the sheriff requires a valid writ, otherwise they are technically committing trespass.\n\n\nInstalment orders\n\ns 107(1)(b): the court can make an order for the ‘payment of the judgment debt by instalments, payable in such amounts and at such times as are specified in the order.’\nTwo main situations in which an instalment order can be made:\n\n\n\nAs a result of an agreement between the judgment creditor and debtor: r 37.1A;\n\n\n\n\nJudgment debtor can apply for one: r 37.2.\n\n\nRequires an affidavit attesting to their financial circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforcement against land\n\nLand has a special status in the common law. Enforcement against land is quite difficult.\nr 39.21(1)(2): a creditor who wants to enforce against land must file an affidavit verifying the registration of a writ for the levy of property and showing receipt of advice from the Sheriff that they cannot obtain satisfaction of the writ by proceeding further against the goods of the judgment debtor.\n\nA notice advising the judgment debtor of this move must be made.\n\n\nrr 39.22 – 39.24: specify steps which must be taken to enforce against land\n\n\nOrders against third parties\n\nTwo main orders against third parties:\nGarnishee order\n\nCan target parties that owe the judgment debtor money (e.g. banks) or the debtor’s employer (rr 39.36 &amp; 39.37).\nJudgment creditor applies by way of notice of motion supported by affidavit (rr 39.34 &amp; 39.35).\n\n\nCharging order\n\nOrder made against the beneficial interest debtor has in any securities.\nrr 39.44 &amp; 39.45.\n\n\n\n\nOther enforcement tools\n\nReceivers (r 40.2)\n\nUsually only appointed as a last resort in relation to unusual property interests or circumstances.\nr 26.7 outlines powers of receivers\n\n\nSequestration (rr 40.2 &amp; 40.3)\n\nOld remedy based on physically excluding the contemnor from their property.\nVery rare.\n\n\nContempt (pt 55 of the Supreme Court Rules).\n\nJudgment creditor wanting to pursue contempt applies by notice of motion supported by affidavit.\nContempt is punishable by fines and imprisonment in the case of individuals; fines and sequestration in the case of corporations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 12: Appeals\n\nAppeals\n\nAppeals\n\nWhat is an appeal def? A formal process by which an unsuccessful party attempts to have a judgment or order of the court set aside.\nIn NSW the key appellate court is the NSW Court of Appeal.\nThe Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW) is the key piece of legislation regarding the appeals process.\nNB – NSWCA bound by decisions of the High Court. In turn binds other NSW courts with its decisions\n\n\nTypes of appeal\n\nThere are two predominant types of appeal:\n\n\n\nAppeals as of right – s 101(1) of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW)\n\n\ne.g. appeal lies of right from a decision of a Division of the Supreme Court\nNo right to appeal exists at common law:\n\nsee Lacey v Attorney-General of Queensland (2011) 242 CLR 573\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAppeals only with leave – s 101(2) of the SCA. Examples include:\n\n\nInterlocutory judgments and orders:\n\nSCA s 101(2)(e).\n\n\nA judgment or order on an application for summary judgment:\n\nSCA s 101(2)(l).\n\n\nA judgment that a company be wound up:\n\nSCA s 101(2)(n).\n\n\nJudgments restraining or refusing to restrain winding up proceedings re companies:\n\nSCA s 101(2)(o) &amp; (p).\n\n\nA judgment or order in proceedings of the Court with respect to the taxation or assessment of costs:\n\nSCA s 101(2)(q); or\n\n\nFinal judgments that involve less than $100,000:\n\nSCA s 101(2)(r).\n\n\n\n\nStrict appeal (an appeal stricto sensu)\n\nWhen the court is required to confine its consideration to whether the judgment appealed from was correct when it was given.\nThis type of appeal considers the law and facts as at the time when the judgment was given.\nAppeals to the High Court are in the nature of strict appeals.\n\n\nDe novo appeal\n\nThis is effectively a retrial where the evidence is given again and the appellate court forms its own view of the facts and law.\n\n\nRehearing\n\nThis type of appeal determines the position of the parties as at the date of the rehearing on the record of the evidence before the trial judge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe nature of an appeal\n\ns 75A of the SCA tells us a lot about the nature of an appeal,particularly sub-sections 5-8.\n\ns 75A(5) – an appeal is by way of a rehearing.\ns 75A(6) – appellate court has all the powers and duties of the original court.\ns 75A(7) – the court may receive further evidence.\ns 75A(8) – despite ss 7, where the appeal is from a judgment after a trial or hearing on the merits, the court won’t receive further evidence except on special grounds.\n\n\nSee Fox v Percy (2003) 214 CLR 118 at [27];\nHouse v R (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504–5.\n\n\nAppeal

MISREPRESENTATION / DECEIT\n\nCommon law allows rescission for fraudulent misrepresentation.\nRemedy\n\nPlaintiff can choose:\n\n\n\nRescission (Restoration to pre-contractual position)

five elements of deceit:\n\nfirst, that the defendant made a false representation;\nsecondly, that the defendant made the representation with the knowledge that it was false, or that the defendant was reckless or careless as to whether the representation was false or not\nthirdly, that the defendant made the representation with the intention that it be relied upon by the plaintiff;\nfourthly, that the plaintiff acted in reliance on the false representation; and\nfifthly, that the plaintiff suffered damage which was caused by reliance on the false representation.\n\n\nDerry v Peek (1889) 14 App

+ unconscionable conduct\n\nFacts suggest that plaintiff:\n\nwas at a special disadvantage vis-a-vis the defendant; AND\ninfluence was applied by the defendant such that the plaintiff did not exercise his or her own free will.\nD must show signing is fair, just, and reasonable\n\n\n\n\nUndue Influence\n\nJohnson v Buttress (1936) 56 CLR 113\n\n‘The jurisdiction of a court of equity to set aside

influence being presumed from the relations existing between the parties, the presumption has not been rebutted.’ [‘presumed undue influence’]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuress vs Undue influence\n\nThe defense of duress exists to protect against contracts that are obtained by some type of threat or coercion.\nThe defense of undue influence exists for a more specialized role, to protect against assent obtained

(1955) 93 CLR 546 (High Court of Australia)\nJurisdiction: Privy Council; High Court of Australia\nFacts: Australian Woollen Mills Pty Ltd (AWM) claimed a unilateral contract arose from the Commonwealth government’s wool subsidy scheme.\n\nThe scheme subsidized wool purchases for woollen product manufacturers after World War II to ensure low prices.\nThe Commonwealth promised subsidies to manufacturers buying domestic-use wool.\nAWM purchased wool based on this promise but later repaid excess subsidies due to scheme discontinuation.\n\n\nProcedural History: AWM sued Commonwealth for recovery of repaid subsidies and unpaid subsidies on certain purchases\nIssue Raised: Whether the letters from Commonwealth constituted a binding offer to form unilateral contracts with manufacturers like AWM.\nLegal Reasoning and Ratio:\n\nThe alleged contracts were of the unilateral type, with acceptance through performance.\nTo establish a contract, the statement must be offered as consideration for an act, with a quid pro quo relationship between the statement and the act.\nIn cases like these, the presence of an implied or express request by the alleged promisor is essential to determine the existence of an offer.\nThe intention to create a legally enforceable duty must be present in the offer.\nAn implied request can provide a useful test for determining a true offer and acceptance for contract formation.\nIn this case, the letters from the Commonwealth were statements of policy, not contractual offers. The scheme was more administrative than contractual.\nThe presence of a request does not automatically establish a contract; it depends on the intention to create an obligation.\nConsideration must be sufficient, not adequate\n\n(consideration definition).\na contract should be a bargain supported by consideration in the nature of a quid pro quo\n\n\n\n\nRatio\n\nratio decidendi of Australian Woollen Mills Pty Ltd v Commonwealth is that the expenditure of money in reliance on an announcement by the government that it would pay a subsidy to a manufacturer on wool purchased and used for local manufacture is not itself sufficient to create a contract to pay the subsidy\n\n\nResult: The court dismissed AWM’s claim, ruling that no binding contracts were constituted, and the Commonwealth’s letters were statements of policy rather than contractual offers. The appeal was also dismissed by the Privy Council.\n\n\nBeaton v McDivitt (1987) 13 NSWLR 162\n\nSplit 25 acres\nGave quarter land to “someone interested in the form of cultivation known as permaculture to work the block”\nOccupied land without payment - per agreement\nDillwyn v Llewelyn - “an exception to the modern requirement that a contract should be a bargain supported by consideration in the nature of a quid pro quo”.

D will not have provided good consideration for the promise.\nCase Summary: Foakes v Beer (1884) 9 App Cas 605 (House of Lords)\n\nAppeal Information: This was an appeal from the Court of Appeal.\nFacts:\n\nOn 11 August 1875, Beer obtained a judgment against Foakes for a debt amounting to £2 090 19s.\nOn 21 December 1876, a memorandum of agreement was made and signed by Foakes and Beer.\nThis agreement specified that if Foakes paid £500 immediately and further installments of £150 on specified dates until the full sum was paid off, Beer would not proceed with the judgment.\nBy June 1882, Beer took out a summons to proceed on the judgment, leading to a trial on the matter of the debt’s status.\nIt was determined at trial that Foakes had paid all required instalments but Beer claimed unpaid interest.\nCave J found in favour of Foakes, believing Beer could not execute any sum due to the agreement.\nThe Queen’s Bench Division upheld the decision. However, the Court of Appeal reversed it, favoring Beer’s claim for the interest.\n\n\nJudgment (Earl of Selbourne LC):\n\n[610] Raised doubts about whether the agreement meant waiving the interest Beer was entitled to by law.\n[611] Stressed that the agreement could not be legally enforced against Beer unless there was consideration.\nThe main question was whether paying a lesser amount than the full debt could be considered legal satisfaction for the whole debt.\nReferenced the doctrine stated by Sir Edward Coke in Pinnel’s case from 1602. According to this, paying a lesser amount could not satisfy a larger debt.\nThe doctrine made a distinction between agreements under seal and those not under seal. The former is binding, while the latter requires consideration.\n[614] The creditor’s benefit from getting part of their money does not serve as legal consideration.\n\n\nOther Lords (LORD WATSON, LORD FITZGERALD):\n\nBoth concurred with Earl of Selbourne LC’s conclusions.\n\n\nLORD BLACKBURN:\n\n[622] Emphasized that many men of business would see value in prompt payment of part of a debt rather than waiting for full payment, especially when there’s doubt about the debtor’s solvency.\nHad reservations about fully agreeing with the majority opinion but did not elucidate his full dissent.\n\n\nDecision: The appeal was dismissed, upholding the Court of Appeal’s decision in favor of Beer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExceptions to the existing legal duty rule\n\n\nWilliams v Roffey Bros &amp; Nicholls (Contractors)\n\nCourt &amp; Date: Court of Appeal, 1991\nParties:\n\nPlaintiff/Appellant: Williams\nDefendant/Respondent: Roffey Bros &amp; Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd\n\n\nFacts:\n\nRoffey Bros held a contract to refurbish 27 flats.\nWilliams was subcontracted by Roffey Bros for carpentry for £20,000.\nWilliams faced financial difficulties due to the low agreed price.\nTo ensure completion and avoid penalties for delay, Roffey Bros orally agreed to pay Williams an extra £10,300, at £575 per flat.\nWilliams continued work but stopped after seven weeks when he had only been paid £1,500 by the defendants.\nRoffey Bros did not pay the outstanding balance.\nRoffey Bros then hired other carpenters to finish the work.\n\n\nIssue:\n\nWas there consideration for Roffey Bros’ promise to pay Williams an additional £10,300, at the rate of £575 per completed flat?\n\n\nHolding:\n\nYes, there was consideration for the promise.\n\n\nReasoning:\n\nThe main contention was the traditional legal principle from Stilk v Myrick that performing an existing contractual obligation is not good consideration for a new promise.\nIt was recognized that the promise to pay more was in both parties’ interests.\nRoffey Bros derived practical benefits,\n\nsuch as ensuring Williams continued his work, avoiding penalties, and avoiding the costs of hiring new carpenters.\nPractical benefits means that the benefit of not receiving the full amount is still worth it because they are providing enough of a service to get by\n\n\nGLIDEWELL LJ outlined a proposition that refined the traditional principle, stating that if a party obtains a benefit from a promise, and it isn’t due to duress or fraud, it can be considered good consideration.\nBased on these findings, the promise by Roffey Bros was supported by valuable consideration and is enforceable.\n\n\nJudgment:\n\nThe appeal was dismissed. Williams’ agreement with Roffey Bros was legally binding and enforceable.\n\n\n\n\n\nCase Name: Musumeci v Winadell Pty Ltd (1994) 34 NSWLR 723 (Supreme Court of New South Wales)\n\nJurisdiction: Binding in New South Wales.\nProcedural History:\n\nPlaintiffs were tenants of a fruit and vegetable shop owned by the defendant.\nA larger competing fruit and vegetable shop was introduced in the same shopping center, threatening plaintiffs’ ability to pay rent.\nDefendant initially promised reduced rent but later sought to withdraw the promise.\nPlaintiffs sought a declaration that the reduced rent promise was binding.\n\n\nOriginal Dispute:\n\nPlaintiffs’ ability to pay rent was threatened due to competition from a larger tenant.\nDefendant initially promised reduced rent but later wanted to withdraw this promise.\n\n\nCurrent Reason for Trial:\n\nTo determine whether the reduced rent promise by the landlord was binding.\n\n\nMaterial Facts:\n\nPlaintiffs were tenants of a shop owned by the defendant.\nA larger competitor tenant was introduced in the shopping center, endangering plaintiffs’ ability to pay rent.\nDefendant initially promised to accept reduced rent but later

discussed the enforceability of modifications to contracts.\n\n\nTests:\n\nWhether there was sufficient consideration for the landlord’s promise.\nWhether the promise was induced by economic duress or

“Williams v Roffey” case and debated the concept of consideration, economic duress, and fairness.\nCritiqued the traditional notion of consideration and proposed a broader approach based on practical benefit or detriment.\n\n\nLegal Reasoning and Ratio:\n\nThe judge re-examined the principles of consideration and economic duress.\nProposed that practical benefits or detriments could suffice as consideration.\nConsideration need not be strictly commensurate with the value exchanged.\nProposed a reformulated approach for determining enforceability based on practical benefits or detriments and fairness.\n\n\nResult:\n\nThe judge concluded that, subject to re-casting the elements of the “Williams v Roffey” case, a practical benefit or detriment could suffice as consideration.\n\n\nThe reduced rent promise was found to be binding based on the practical benefit to the landlord and detriment to the tenants.\nThe case was decided in favor of the plaintiffs.\n\n\n\nCase Summary (Detailed)\n\nName of the Case and Citation:\n\nWilliams v Roffey Bros &amp; Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd [1991] 1 QB 1\n\n\nJurisdiction:\n\nEngland and Wales (Court of Appeal)\nBinding within its jurisdiction and persuasive in many common law jurisdictions globally.\n\n\nProcedural History:\n\nWilliams initially brought the case to the Queen’s Bench Division seeking the extra payment as promised by Roffey Bros.\nThe matter was then appealed to the Court of Appeal.\n\n\nOriginal Dispute:\n\nThe initial disagreement was concerning the amount payable under a carpentry contract.\nWilliams struggled to complete the work at the originally agreed price due to unforeseen financial hardships.\n\n\nCurrent Reason for Trial:\n\nThe appeal sought to determine whether Roffey Bros’ promise to pay extra, despite no new consideration being apparent, was enforceable.\n\n\nMaterial Facts:\n\nWilliams and Roffey Bros entered into a contract where Williams was to provide carpentry services for a predetermined price.\nDue to unforeseen financial constraints, Williams approached Roffey Bros, indicating he could not finish the work at the agreed price.\nTo avoid the inconvenience and potential additional costs of sourcing a new carpenter, Roffey Bros agreed to pay an additional sum per flat completed.\nRoffey Bros, despite witnessing Williams continue his work with the understanding of the new agreement, did not pay the promised additional amounts.\n\n\nIssue Raised by the Material Facts:\n\nThe primary legal question was whether the promise by Roffey Bros to pay more, without any apparent fresh consideration, constituted an enforceable agreement.\n\n\nPrecedences:\n\nThe court revisited Stilk v Myrick (1809), where it was ruled that a party’s promise to perform a duty they’re already contractually obligated to perform doesn’t amount to valid consideration.\n\n\nTests:\n\nThe court explored if Roffey Bros derived a “practical benefit” from the revised terms with Williams, even if Williams was only carrying out his existing duty.\n\n\nWords and Phrases Considered:\n\nKey terms assessed included “Consideration”, “Practical benefit”, and “Economic duress”.\n\n\nWhat Each Judge Thought:\n\nAll judges in the Court of Appeal, while noting the principles from Stilk v Myrick, agreed that in modern commerce, if a party receives a practical benefit from varied terms, even if there’s no new consideration in the classic sense, that can make the varied terms enforceable.\nThey recognized the commercial reality and the practical benefit derived by Roffey Bros in ensuring the continued services of Williams.\n\n\nLegal Reasoning and Ratio of the Case:\n\nThe court emphasized that the doctrine of consideration shouldn’t be a tool for injustice.\nIf one party derives a practical benefit from varied terms, even if those terms merely ensure the performance of an existing duty, such an agreement can be enforceable.\nThe evolution of business practices and the need for commercial efficacy played a role in this decision.\n\n\nResult:\n\nThe Court of Appeal ruled in favor of Williams, holding that Roffey Bros must honor their promise to pay the additional amounts as they derived a genuine practical benefit from the revised agreement.\nThe potential inconvenience and additional costs they avoided by not having to find a new carpenter were deemed significant.\n\n\n\n\n\nRe Selectmove Ltd [1995] 1 WLR 474\n\nif the principle from “Williams v Roffey Bros” (i.e., a promise to perform an existing contractual obligation can be good consideration if the promisor gains a practical benefit) were extended to the obligation to make payment, it would essentially negate the principle set in “Foakes v Beer.”\n\nFoakes v beer principle: if you owe someone money and they agree to let you pay less to settle the entire debt, that agreement isn’t enforceable unless there’s something additional given in return.\n\n\nCourt of Appeal can’t overrule or sidestep “Foakes v Beer” based on the principles from “Williams v Roffey Bros.\nNeed higher authority to evaluate\n\n\n\nDuty owed to a third party\n\nA promise to perform an act which the promisor is under an existing duty to a third party to perform may constitute good consideration.\n\nA’s promise to B to perform a duty which A is already contractually obliged to perform for C\n\nMay = consideration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPao On v Lau Yiu Long\n\nPao On v Lau Yiu Long [1980] AC 614\nProcedural History:\nOriginal Dispute:\n\nShare transfer transaction dispute between Pao On and Lau Yiu Long over a guarantee provision.\n\n\nCurrent Reason for Trial:\n\nChallenge to the validity of a guarantee provision under the threat of canceling an existing agreement.\n\n\nMaterial Facts:\n\nShare transfer agreement in question.\nGuarantee provision to ensure share price stability.\nThreat to cancel a subsidiary agreement unless the guarantee was provided.\n\n\nIssue Raised by the Material Facts:\n\nThe validity of forming a contract (guarantee provision) under commercial pressure or perceived duress.\n\n\nPrecedences:\n\nWilliams v Williams

Phrases Considered:\n\n“Valid Consideration”\n“Duress”\n“Commercial Pressure”\n“Coercion of Will”\n“Public Policy”\n\n\nWhat Each Judge Thought:\nLegal Reasoning and the Ratio of the Case:\n\nContracts formed under coercion of will can be considered voidable.\nMere commercial pressure isn’t enough for a contract to be voidable.\nUpholding the sanctity of contracts unless they’re undermined by specific factors.\n\n\nResult:\n\nAppeal in favor of Pao On and others was allowed.\n\n\nSignificance &amp; Precedents Set for the Future:\n\nThe case of Pao On v Lau Yiu Long is significant for several reasons:\n\nClarification on Consideration: The case delved into the nuances of valid consideration, specifically examining whether fulfilling a pre-existing duty can serve as valid consideration.\n\nThis establishes a clearer boundary for future commercial transactions.\n\n\nDuress vs. Commercial Pressure: One of the most impactful outcomes of this case was the distinction it drew between contracts formed under genuine duress (coercion of will) and those formed under mere commercial pressure.\n\nThis ensures that not every aggressive negotiation or hard bargaining situation can be used as grounds to set aside a contract.\n\n\nUpholding Contract Sanctity: By reinforcing the principle that contracts are to be respected unless there are clear undermining factors, the case sent a strong message about the importance of commercial agreements and the legal system’s commitment to upholding them.\n\n\nOverall, Pao On v Lau Yiu Long sets important precedents for commercial law, especially in situations where the validity of contracts and agreements is under scrutiny due to external pressures or perceived threats.\n\nIt provides valuable guidance for future cases where the distinction between genuine duress and mere commercial pressure is in question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWigan v Edwards (1973) 47 ALJR 58\nThe contract contained no express term that the

issue may arise in a social or domestic context.\n\n\nAn agreement to help a friend to move some furniture in return for dinner involves an exchange of promises, but is clearly not intended to be legally binding.\n\n\nAn agreement relating to more substantial matters, such as employment or the sale of valuable property, may be intended to attract legal consequences even when it is made with a close relative.\n\n\nAn issue of intention to contract may arise where an agreement is made between a government and an individual.\n\n\nThe implementation of government policy may, for example, lead a government to reach an agreement with a particular individual to provide some assistance.\nThe fact that the individual is providing something in return for that assistance does not necessarily mean that the parties intend to make a contract.\n\n\n\n\nWhere parties reach a preliminary agreement, the question may arise whether the parties intend to be bound immediately, or not until some time in the future when the parties have finalised some outstanding issues or recorded their agreement in a more formal manner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncertain types of agreements are presumed to be intended to be

initiated the case seeking employment benefits.\nThe trial court ruled in favor of the Greek Orthodox Community of SA.\nThe decision was overturned by the Supreme Court of South Australia.\nThe matter was then appealed to the High Court.\n\n\nOriginal Dispute:\n\nThe primary question was whether there existed a contractual relationship between Archbishop Ermogenous and the Greek Orthodox Community of SA Inc that could give rise to employment benefits.\n\n\nCurrent Reason for Trial:\n\nThe appeal before the High Court was to ascertain if such a contractual relationship was legally recognized.\n\n\nMaterial Facts:\n\nArchbishop Ermogenous received an offer of employment which he accepted.\nWhile their relationship was primarily spiritual, there were stipulated duties and compensations, leading to a contention of whether it was contractual.\n\n\nIssue Raised by the Material Facts:\n\nDoes a spiritual calling and relationship exclude the possibility of a legally enforceable contractual relationship?\n\n\nPrecedences:\n\nThe case referenced precedents such as Rogers v Booth and Lewery v Salvation Army, which dealt with similar issues.\n\n\nTests:\n\nThe court looked at the objective intentions of the parties.\nThey examined if there was a clear offer, acceptance, and consideration that would make up a valid contract.\n\n\nWords and Phrases Considered:\n\n“Contractual intention”, “spiritual duties”, “enforceable rights”, “offer”, “acceptance”, and “consideration”.\n\n\nWhat Each Judge Thought:\n\nWhile nuances between judges’ opinions might exist, the High Court generally acknowledged that a spiritual relationship doesn’t preclude a legal contract.\nThey noted that the terms between the Archbishop and the Greek Orthodox Community were more than mere spiritual obligations.\n\n\nLegal Reasoning and Ratio of the Case:\n\nThe Court emphasized that the determination of a contract doesn’t rest solely on the nature of the duties (spiritual vs. secular).\nIt is about the intention of the parties.\nIf the terms are clear, providing legal rights and duties, it can be considered a contract even if it’s within a religious context.\n\n\nResult:\n\nThe High Court allowed the appeal, meaning they recognized the possibility of a contractual relationship between Archbishop Ermogenous and the Greek Orthodox Community of

Benson and Edwards v Skyways Ltd that deal with the enforceability of certain contractual terms.\n\n\nOriginal dispute:\n\nThe dispute initially centered around the interpretation of a “letter of comfort” provided by ANI during financial negotiations.\n\n\nCurrent reason for trial:\n\nThe court was asked to determine whether the statements made in the “letter of comfort” were legally binding promises or mere representations, and if ANI had indeed breached any such promises.\n\n\nMaterial facts:\n\nANI and Banque Brussels Lambert were involved in a financial negotiation regarding a US$1 million facility.\nUpon the bank’s insistence, this was increased to a US$5 million facility, contingent upon ANI providing a “letter of comfort” to give assurance of the deal’s soundness.\n\n\nIssue raised by the material facts:\n\nWere the statements made in the “letter of comfort” legally enforceable promises?\n\nIf so, did ANI breach these promises?\n\n\n\n\nPrecedences:\n\nThe court looked to prior decisions like Edwards v Skyways Ltd, Kleinwort Benson [1988] 1 WLR 799, and Chemco Leasing SpA v Redifusion plc.\nThese cases provided guidance on when seemingly non-binding terms might be enforced and the intent behind such terms.\n\n\nTests:\n\nThe court sought to identify:\n\nIf the statements in the “letter of comfort” bore any promissory intent.\nWhether ANI and Banque Brussels Lambert had an understanding that these terms were binding.\n\n\n\n\nWords and Phrases Considered:\n\nThe court scrutinized phrases such as “Letter of comfort,” evaluating its typical usage in the financial sector.\nAdditionally, terms like “Intention” and “Promise” were analyzed to determine their weight in the given context.\n\n\nWhat each judge thought:\n\nWhile individual opinions might have varied in nuance, the judges largely agreed that commercial transactions should not be nullified based on mere semantics.\nThey leaned towards upholding the weight of commercial intent over strict linguistic interpretation.\n\n\nLegal reasoning and the ratio:\n\nThe court’s rationale was underpinned by the notion that commercial bargains, especially those involving significant stakes, should be honored.\nIf statements within such bargains have a promissory shade, they ought to be seen as binding, barring clear evidence to the contrary.\n\n\nResult:\n\nThe court found ANI liable, holding that certain statements within the “letter of comfort” bore binding intent and that ANI had breached them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOMESTIC AND SOCIAL AGREEMENTS\n\nBalfour v Balfour [1919] 2 KB 571, 57\nfinancial agreements between spouses will not attract legal consequences.\nErmogenous v Greek Orthodox Community of SA Inc [2002]\n\nno presumption should be made about the enforceability of agreements made in a social or domestic context\nEach case will be considered on its own facts, although the nature of the relationship between the parties and the context in which the agreement was made remain important considerations.\n\n\nTodd v Nicol\n\nintention to create legal relations.\n\nvoyage by the plaintiffs to Australia to reside with the defendant at her home.\nThe discourse touches upon various legal principles surrounding contracts, including:\n\nOffer and Acceptance:\n\nA contract is formed when there’s an offer by one party and acceptance by another.\nThis offer and acceptance can be explicit or implied from conduct or language.\n\n\nConsideration:\n\nFor a contract to be binding, there must be something of value exchanged between the parties, known as consideration.\nConsideration can take many forms such as a right, interest, benefit, or even forbearance or responsibility.\n\n\nIntention:\n\nThe parties must intend the agreement to be legally binding.\nThis intention can be explicit or implicit.\nFactors like language used, the situation of the parties, and the surrounding circumstances can indicate the presence or absence of such intention.\nIn some situations, legal enforceability is presumed, especially in business arrangements.\nHowever, in personal or domestic arrangements, such presumption may be doubtful.\n\n\nCertainty:\n\nThe terms of a contract must be clear.\nIf the terms are vague, uncertain, or still subject to negotiation, it might be unenforceable.\n\n\nLicense:\n\nThe plaintiffs were given a licence to reside with the defendant.\nThe text examines the revocability of this licence and the conditions under which it becomes irrevocable.\n\n\nImplication of Terms:\n\nSometimes, terms are not explicitly stated but are implied to make the contract operational according to the intention of the parties.\nThe terms must be necessary to the nature of the contract and directly related to its purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGOVERNMENT AGREEMENTS\n\nAdministration of Papua and New Guinea v Leahy\n\nCommonwealth Department of Agriculture as part of its tick eradication program.\n\nAssisted by department for spraying cattle for ticks\nPlaintiff supplied and paid for other labor\nDepartment officers were not good, and plaintiff sued for damages for breach of contract\n\nAgreed promises are not enough if the department did not intend to enter into a contract\nOne judge believes administrative arrangement not contract - social service\n\n\nMain question: whether the proved and admitted facts, when considered in their setting of time and circumstance, establish a contract, or only an arrangement having no legally binding force\nThe arrangements made\non 7th June 1954 were not contractual and the judgment giving damages for the failure of the Administration, through the two defaulting officers, to give effect to them on its part cannot be sustained\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPRELIMINARY AGREEMENTS\n\nMasters v Cameron\nCase Summary (Small)\n\nNote the name of the case and its citation (Jurisdiction - is it binding or persuasive?)\n\nMasters v Cameron (1954) 91 CLR 35\n\n\nClarify the procedural history of the case.\n\nAppeal from the Supreme Court of Western Australia\n\n\nWhat the original dispute was\n\nCameron (the respondent) and Mr and Mrs Masters (the appellants) signed a document whereby Cameron agreed to sell and the Masters agreed to buy for £17,500 a certain property owned by Cameron.\nThe purchasers encountered financial difficulties, denied that they were legally bound to purchase the property, and sought to recover the deposit\n\n\nCurrent reason for trial\n\nIs the document on its true construction constitutes a binding contract between the respondent and the appellants, or only a record of terms upon which the signatories were agreed as a basis for the negotiation of a contract\n\n\nAscertain the material facts\n\nPlainly enough they were agreed that there should be a sale and purchase, and the parties, the property, the price, and the date for possession were all clearly settled between them.\n\n\nState the issue raised by the material facts\n\n\nPrecedences\n\n\nTests\n\nWords and Phrases Considered\n\n“This agreement is made subject to the preparation of a formal contract of sale which shall be acceptable to my [Cameron’s] solicitors on the above terms and conditions”\n\nSubject to contract\n\nChinnock v Marchioness of Ely (1865) 46 - stipulation as to the contract is a term of the assent, and there is no agreement independent of that\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat each judge thought\n\nTHE COURT (DIXON CJ, McTIERNAN and KITTO JJ):\n\n3 classes of contract in this case:\n\nEverything is ready, but want to have the terms restated in a form which will be fuller or more precise but not different in effect.\n\nMost common\nRossiter v Miller (1878) 3 App Cas 1124,\nas soon as the fact is established of the final mutual assent of the parties so that those who draw up the formal agreement have not the power to vary the terms already settled, I think the contract is completed”\n\n\nDuplicate contract, but made performance of one or more of the terms conditional upon the execution of a formal document.\n\nNiesmann v Collingridge (1921) 29 -\nRich and Starke JJ observed that this did not make the signing of a contract a condition of agreement, but made it a condition of the obligation to pay, and carried a necessary implication that each party would sign a contract in accordance with the terms of agreement.\n\n\nOr the intention of the parties is not to make a concluded bargain at all, unless and until they execute a formal contract.\n\nare cases in which the terms of agreement are not intended to have, and therefore do not have, any binding effect of their own\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify the legal reasoning and the ratio of the case.\n\nAccordingly the first of the four questions which went to trial should have been answered by saying that no binding contract for the sale and purchase of the property mentioned in the document dated 6 December 1951, was made between [Cameron] and [Masters]\n\n\nResult\n\nAppeal allowed\n\n\n\n\nBaulkham Hills Private Hospital Pty Ltd v GR Securities Pty Ltd (1986) 40 NSWLR 622,\n\nFourth case + 3 Masters v Cameron\n\none in which the parties were content to be bound immediately and exclusively by the terms which they had agreed upon whilst expecting to make a further contract in substitution for the first contract, containing, by

vegetable shop.\nWinadell lease other premises to a competitor, which caused the Musumecis’ into fall.\nMusumecis requested to renegotiate the lease.\nWinadell promised to reduce the rent by 1/3.\nParties disputed how to calculate the new rent.\nWinadell argued its promise was unenforceable because the Musumecis did not provide consideration for it.\n\n\nExisting Duty owed to third

value at that time.\n\nPlaintiffs refused to complete the Main Agreement unless the defendants provided a better guarantee.\n\n\n\nApril 1974: Market price of Fu Chip shares was less than

Contracts\n\nIntro, Completeness\n\ncertainty and completeness\n\nif the parties have entered into a contract, then it must contain enough terms to function properly,\nand those terms must be expressed adequately clearly so that a court can enforce them.\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nHow certain do the terms of an agreement have to be before the law will recognise it to be a legally binding contract?\n\nDifficult (if not impossible) for parties to anticipate and provide for every contingency.\n\nAlso can be difficult for parties to articulate themselves so there is only one interpretation and no ambiguity.\n\n\nRaises issues of sufficiency — what is sufficiently complete and what is sufficiently certain.\nIt is fact specific — nature of agreement and circumstances in which agreement was made.\nJudicial attitudes differ in their opinions as to the degree of certainty and completeness required, and the extent to which the courts should till gaps and resolve ambiguities.\nTrend — judges increasingly willing to fill gaps and resolve ambiguities (implied terms).\n\n\n\n\nCertainty aspects\n\nSufficiently certain\nSufficiently complete\nPromise must NOT Illusory\n\nA promise is discretionary - don’t have to do it\n\n\n\n\nCompleteness Overview\n\nParties must have reached agreement on all of its essential terms.\n\nWhat is an essential term?\n\nA term without which the contract cannot be enforced.\nA term which only the parties can supply.\n\n\n\n\nWhether an omission is fatal to contract formation depends on three main factors\n\n\n\nHow important or essential is the term that is missing?\n\n\nMeaning of essentiality in this context: Milne v Attorney-General (Tas) (1956) 95 CLR 460\nWhether the courts can fill the gaps by applying an objective or reasonable standard.\n\n\n\n\nHave the parties turned their mind to the issue?\n\n\nWhy has the term been left out? Was it deliberately left out or was it by mistake?\nAgreements to agree are not enforceable. The court will generally not fill the gap in these circumstances.\n\n\n\n\nHas the agreement been partly executed?\n\n\nIf one of the parties has already performed all or some of the contract, the courts are less likely to find that an agreement is incomplete (Foley v Classique).\n\n\n\n\nNote: A mechanism or formula can be used to set an essential term, and this will not result in a contract being void for want of certainty.\n\n\nSufficiently Complete: Essential Terms\n\nFor a contract to be sufficiently complete, parties must have reached agreement on all essential terms.\nConsider: What is an essential term?\n\nA term without which the contract cannot be enforced.\nA term which only the parties can supply.\n\n\nMilne v Attorney-General (Tas) (1956) 95 CLR 460 upholds this\n\n\nHOW IMPORTANT / ESSENTIAL IS THE MISSING TERM?\n\nThe threshold question is whether the parties have specifically agreed on all the terms that only they can decide.\nWhat matters is whether the court can enforce the contract in the absence of the term in question, without exceeding its role as the interpreter, rather than the author, of the contract.\nIf the parties have failed to agree on essential terms, the court will refuse to find an enforceable contract.\nDepends on nature of the contract and circumstances of the case\n\nThe complexity of the contract and the courts understanding of and familiarity with the type of transaction.\nThe reason why the parties failed to reach agreement on the issue.\nWhether the agreement remains wholly executory or has been wholly or partly\nperformed on one side.\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\nLease of land\n\nEssential\n\nThe commencement date,\nthe rental to be paid,\nparties,\nsubject matter (description of the land)\nWithout these terms, the agreement for a lease will not be binding\n\n\n\n\nSale of land\n\nEssential\n\nthe parties,\ndescription of the land\nand the price\n\n\nNon-essential:\n\nSettlement date — the court can imply a reasonable settlement date\n\n\n\n\nSale of goods\n\nEssential:\n\nthe parties\nand description of the goods\n\n\nNon-essential:\n\na failure to stipulate the price may not be fatal (s.13 Goods Act (NSW))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if one party has already performed all or part of the contract?\n\nThe courts are less likely to find an agreement is incomplete if one party has already performed all or some of the contract.\nSee the case of Foley v Classique Coaches Ltd (1934) 2 KB 1, which illustrates the court’s effort to find certain y in a case where there has been some performance.\n\n\nFoley v Classique Coaches Ltd (1934) 2 KB 1\n\nFoley and Classique Coaches entered into a written agreement on the 11th April 1930, whereby it was agreed that Foley would sell some of his land to Classique for lbs 1,100.00 (Land Agreement)\nThis Land Agreement was made subject to a condition that the parties would enter into another contract, the Petrol Supply Agreement on the same day, with the following terms:\n\nFoley would sell petrol to Classique at price to be agreed in writing from time to time\nThe Petrol Agreement was to remain in force during Foley’s life and his wife’s\nClassique would not buy petrol from anyone else\nIf any dispute arose regarding the subject matter or construction of the Petrol Supply Agreement, the dispute shall be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Act 1889 (UK)\n\n\nIn accordance with the two Agreements, the land was transferred to Classique and they bought petrol from Foley for 3 years. Then Classique wanted to purchase cheaper petrol elsewhere\nHeld\n\nThere was an effective and enforceable contract, although no definite price had been agreed with regard to the future supply of petrol\nKey distinction here is that the land had been conveyed and the parties were well into performance of the agreement.\n\n3 years into agreement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay and Butcher v The King (1934) 2 KB 17\n\nMay and Butcher entered into a 12 month contract with the Disposals and Liquidation Commission whereby it was agreed that the Commission would sell Old tentage to May and Butcher but the price would be “agreed upon from time to time” (an agreement to agree).\n\nThe relationship soured and the Commission did not want to continue with the arrangement.\n\n\nHELD:\n\nThe price was an essential term and the agreement was void for want of certainty;\n\nthe parties had agreed to reach agreement on the price in the future, so for the court to imply a reasonable price would be inconsistent with the expressed intentions of the parties, which was to set the price themselves,\n\n\n\n\nHowever, an agreement to agree on an essential term may be enforceable if:\n\nThe agreement has been partly performed: Foley v Classique Coaches.\nA mechanism / formula is specified to supply a term if the parties are unable to reach agreement.\n\n\n\n\nCompleteness: A mechanism or formula can fill the gap\n\nEffective mechanism\n\nParties may make a valid contract that defers agreement on an essential term by providing an effective mechanism for supplying the term in the event they fail to reach agreement.\nSee eg, the case of George v Roach (1942) 67 CLR 253:\n\nGeorge carried on the business of a newsagent and storekeeper.\n\nHe agreed to sell his business to Spencer.\nThe contract provided that a valuation of the newspaper agency would be provided by a third party, Mr Solomon, and this valuation would form the basis of the purchase price.\nSpencer paid lbs 1,100 on account of the purchase price even though the valuation for not yet taken place.\nMr Solomon refused to undertake the valuation.\nMr Spencer had died by then but his wife, Roach (on behalf of his estate to recover the lbs 1,100 because the contract was void for uncertainty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe High Court held that an agreement was ineffective when part of the purchase price was to be fixed by a nominated valuer who refused to carry out the task.\n\n\nEffective formula\n\nAn alternative is for the parties to agree on a formula for settling an essential term in the event of a dispute\n\n(eg: a base sum and a mathematical formula that incorporates reference to changes in the Consumer Price Index to determine increases in rent each year).\n\n\nThe validity of such a contract will then depend on whether the court regards the formula or standard as sufficiently certain.\n\n\n\n\nCertainty\n\nThe main purpose of interpreting terms of a contract is to work out what exactly each party has to do to meet the obligations under it. Interpretation is not always easy\nConsider the agreements below:\n\nParties enter into an agreement to build a rear decking. They agree that the “…timber used in the must be of high quality”\nParties enter into an agreement to “supply Coles with fresh eggs”\n\n\nWhat do these terms mean?\nCourt’s approach to a particular term that is vague or imprecise\n\nNot a pedantic test — some ambiguity is acceptable:\n\nCouncil of the Upper Hunter v Aust Chilling and Freezing\n\n\nWhether an objective standard (where available) can be relied on or implied to save a clause. Courts are often divided as to this approach\n\nBiotechnology v Pace (Note: this case also raises issues of illusory promises)\nWhitlock v Brew\nHall v Busst\nMeehan v Jones\n\n\nUncertainty of meaning is more likely to affect validity if the parties have yet to perform\nAgreements to negotiate in good faith are not necessarily too uncertain:\n\nUnited Group Rail v Rail Corp\n\n\n\n\nCertainty of meaning\n\nCourt’s approach to a term that is vague or imprecise\n\nThe terms must not be vague and imprecise such that the courts cannot attribute sufficiently precise meaning to them.\nCourts do not usually take a narrow approach to the requirement of certainty, and will attribute a meaning to the language used by the parties unless it is impossible to do so.\nAs with incompleteness, uncertainty is more likely to affect a contract that remains wholly executory.\n\n\n\n\nCouncil of the Upper Hunter County District v Australian Chilling &amp; Freezing (1968) 118 CLR 429\n\nThe Council contracted to sell electricity to Australian Chilling and Freezing (“ACF”)\nClause 5 of the agreement provided as follows:\n\nIt is agreed that during the term of this agreement if the supplier’s [Council’s] costs shall vary in other respects than has been hereinbefore provided the supplier [Council] shall have the right to vary the maximum demand charge and the energy charge by notice in writing to the purchaser [ACF]\n\n\nThe agreement also provided for arbitration in the event of a dispute between the parties\nCouncil sought to increase their charges pursuant to clause 5\nACF argued that clause 5, in particular its reference to supplier’s costs varying, was uncertain and unenforceable\nlanguage employed by parties was not “so obscure and so incapable of any definite or precise meaning that the court is unable to attribute to the parties any particular contractual intention”, the contract cannot be held to be uncertain to be void or meaningless\n\n\nImplying Objective Standards\n\nStandards of reasonableness and fairness (and similar concepts) are sometimes employed as terms of a contract expressly by the parties or implied by the courts to make a contract complete. Parties might use terms such as:\n\n“a reasonable price for the goods”\n“a fair and equitable price for her services”\n“price to be set at fair market value”\n\n\nThese concepts are inherently imprecise but the question is whether they are uncertain.\nThe courts will endeavour to give those terms meaning in order to uphold a contract.\nIn some cases, what is reasonable or fair will not be sufficiently certain because it may be impossible to work out what it means.\n\n\nWhitlock v Brew (1968) 118 CLR 445\n\nWhat are the facts?\n\nThe difficulty that the court had to deal with was what does the term “upon such reasonable terms as commonly govern a lease” in clause 5 actually mean?\n\n\nKitto J held:\n\nThe expression ‘upon such reasonable terms as commonly govern a lease would have been sufficiently certain had there been an ascertainable set of terms in common use\n\n\nThe result was that there was no consensus between the parties about key terms, such as the term of the lease, the rent\nThe arbitration clause would assist if there was a dispute as to what terms are reasonable and common to such a lease if such terms actually existed\nThe arbitration clause did not authorise an arbitrator to force on the purchaser such terms that the arbitrator might think are reasonable and ought commonly govern such a lease because to do so would alter the contract\nCourt concluded that clause 5 had no contractual effect, which resulted in the whole contract being rendered void\n\n\nHall v Busst (1960) 104 CLR 206\n\nHall and Busst agreed that Hall would purchase Busst’s land and chattels on an island, known as Bedarra Island for £3.157\nThe agreement provided that:\n\nHall could not re-sell the land without first obtaining Busst’s consent\nSuch consent would be obtained by Hall giving notice to Busst of her intention to resell the land and Busst would have the option of repurchasing\nClause 5 stated: “the purchase price shall be the sum of £3.157 4s 0d to which shall be added the value of all additions and improvements to the said property since the date of purchase…and from which shall be subtracted the value of the deficiencies in chattel property and a reasonable sum to cover depreciation of all buildings and property on the land.”\nHall sold the land and chattels to a third party for £8,500 without giving notice to Busst\nBusst sued Hall for breach of contract. Hall argued that the price clause in the option was void for uncertainty\nThe High Court held that the option was not enforceable because the price was uncertain\n\n\n“the value of all additions and improvements” is not sufficiently certain to give rise to an enforceable contract because there could be no external standard of value of additions and improvements to the island. There was nothing to compare it to, no external standard\n“The value of all deficiencies” was uncertain in the ascertainment of the price\n\nNo external standard to assess what “depreciation of all other buildings and other property on the land” meant\n\n\n\n\nCertainty &amp; Agreements to negotiate\n\nContracts sometimes contain clauses as follows:\n\nParties must ‘negotiate in good faith’ the precise terms of a more comprehensive joint venture agreement\nParties must ‘undertake genuine and good faith negotiations with a view to resolving disputes’\n\n\nSuch concepts such as ‘negotiation’, ‘mediation’ and ‘good faith’ are inherently subjective, but the issue is whether they are enforceable\n\nUK: these agreements cannot be legally binding on the basis that they are too uncertain to enforce\nAustralia: courts have been a bit more flexible and have tried to give such agreements some meaning, but it depends on the precise terms used.

CONSEQUENCES OF UNCERTAINTY\n\nCertainty &amp; Illusory promises\n\nA contract will be illusory if a party gives an unfettered discretion as to performance of a promise\n\nWhat does unfettered mean?\n\n\nWhat is the legal status of an illusory promise?\n\nPlacer Developments Ltd v Commonwealth (1969) 121 CLR 353\n\n\nA term will not be illusory where:\n\nA party is given a latitude of choice which does not amount to complete and unfettered discretion\n\nSee Meehan v Jones (1982) 149 CLR 571\n\n\nThe discretion relates to the fulfilment of a condition upon which the performance of the contract depends (ie there is no discretion as to the performance of the contract once the condition is satisfied)\n\nSee Meehan v Jones (1982) 149 CLR 571\n\n\n\n\nThe discretion is exercised by a third party\n\nGodecke v Kirwan (1973) 129 CLR 629\n\n\n\n\nLegal status of an illusory promise\n\nRecognised general principle\n\nPlacer Developments Ltd v Commonwealth (1969) 121 CLR 353, 356 (Kitto J):\n\n‘Wherever words which by themselves constitute a promise are accompanied by words showing that the promisor is to have a discretion or option as to whether he will carry out that which purports to be the promise, the result is that there is no contract on which an action can be brought at all.’\n\n\n\n\nThere are two ways of conceptualising this:\n\nNo consideration: an illusory promise is no promise at all (recall Australian Woollen Mills case).\nIncomplete contract: an essential term has been left to be determined by one party.\n\n\n\n\nPlacer Developments Ltd v Commonwealth (1969) 121 CLR 353\n\nClause 14 of the Agreement stated that if customs duty had to be paid on the imported products and not remitted, “the Commonwealth will pay to the Timber Company a subsidy upon the exportation of these products from the Territory … of an amount or at a rate determined by the Commonwealth from time to time but the amount of subsidy paid shall not exceed the amount of customs duty paid and not remitted”\nKitto J held:\n\nIn this case (with specific reference to clause 14), the Commonwealth’s promise to pay an unspecified sum of money was illusory, since the Commonwealth was expressly given a discretion to determine the amount to be paid.\nA promise to pay a governmental subsidy is meaningless in the absence of a specification of some amount or some basis of calculation.\n\nThat promise carries no implication that at least a reasonable subsidy shall be paid, for there is no general standard of reasonableness with respect to the quantum of a subsidy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA term will not be illusory where:\n\nA party is given a latitude of choice, which does not amount to complete and unfettered discretion\nThe discretion relates to the fulfilment of a condition upon which the performance of the contract depends, so there is no discretion as to the performance of the contract once the condition is satisfied\n\n\nMeehan v Jones (1982) 149 CLR 571\n\nThe parties entered into a written agreement for the sale of land (an oil refinery) for a price of $800,000.00\nThe contract was subject to two conditions:\n\n\n\nPurchaser or his nominee entering into a satisfactory Agreement or arrangement with Ampol Petroleum Limited for the supply of a satisfactory quantity of crude oil\n\n\n\n\nPurchaser or his nominee receiving approval for finance on satisfactory terms and conditions in an amount sufficient to complete the purchase hereunder;\n\n\nand should either of the above conditions not be satisfied on or before 31 July 1979 (or such extended time as the\n\n\nparties may agree upon) then this Contract (other than for the provisions of this Clause) shall be null and void\nOn 23 July, Jones sold the land to a 3rd party\nOn 30 July, Meehan advised Jones that both conditions had been satisfied. Meehan sought specific performance of the contract\nThe trial judge and the Full Court of the Supreme Court refused specific performance on the basis that the contract was void for uncertainty.\n\nMeehan then appealed to the High Court\n\n\n\n\nCERTAINTY in Meehan v Jones\n\nWhere the words of a condition state that a contract is subject to finance, the question immediately arises whether the test to be applied is a subjective or objective.\nIn either case, the purchaser does not have absolute discretion.\nThe fact that opinions may differ as to which of these two meanings is given to the words of the clause does not mean that the clause is uncertain.\nIn considering whether the objective / subjective approach applied, the court said that unless a clause of this kind makes a clear indication to the contrary, its natural effect is to leave it to the:\n\npurchaser to be [subjectively] satisfied, not some hypothetical reasonable man.\nit may be implied that the purchaser will act honestly in deciding whether or not he is satisfied.\nbut it is not necessary to imply that the purchase will make reasonable efforts to obtain finance.\n\n\n\n\nILLUSORY PROMISE in Meehan v Jones\n\nAlthough there is nothing uncertain about a clause which speaks of [subjective] satisfaction of purchase, could it still be illusory?\nThere is a well settled principle that when “the promisor is to have a discretion or option as to whether he will carry out that which purports to, be the promise, the result is that there is no contract”\nA contract is illusory where one of the parties has a discretion as to whether to perform the contract, but not where one of the parties has a discretion in relation to the fulfilment of a condition on which the contract depends.\n\n\nMeehan v Jones (1982) (cont’d)\n\nTo say that a “subject to finance” or “subject to finance on satisfactory terms and conditions” clause denotes finance which is satisfactory to the purchaser is not to say that he has an absolute or unfettered right to decide what is satisfactory.\nWith some justification the vendor can claim that the agreement is a binding contract which relieves the purchaser from performance only in the event that, acting honestly, or honestly and reasonably, he is unable to obtain suitable finance.\nThere is in this formulation no element of uncertainty - the courts are quite capable of deciding whether the purchaser is acting honestly and reasonably.\nBecause the purchaser must act honestly, or honestly and reasonably, it is not a case where the purchaser has an unfettered discretion as to what constitutes finance on satisfactory terms\n\n– the decision must be reached honestly, or honestly and reasonably.\nJust because there is some discretion, does not make it unfettered\nIn this case, it is a condition, not a term\n\n\nAccordingly, the promise is not illusory\n\n\nGodecke v Kirwan (1973) 129 CLR 629\n\nThe parties signed a document headed ‘Offer and Acceptance’ setting out terms they agreed to for the sale and purchase of land. The agreement provided for a promise by the purchaser to execute, if required to do so, a further agreement in accordance with cl.6\nCl. 6 provided that if a formal agreement was required, it would be prepared by the vendor’s solicitors containing “the foregoing and such other covenants and conditions as they may reasonably require”\nKirwan refused to go ahead and transfer the land. He argued the agreement was illusory because they would be bound by the subsequent formal agreement drawn up by solicitors containing other terms and that conferred on them an unfettered discretion\nWalsh J: the clause should be construed as limited to permitting the insertion of covenants and conditions not inconsistent with those contained in the offer. It was also limited by a standard of reasonableness, determined objectively so it did not confer an unfettered discretion on the solicitors\nWhat did Gibbs J say?\n\n\nBiotechnology Australia Pty Ltd v Pace (1988) 15 NSWLR 130 (Court of Appeal) - scheme one day… somehow somewhere\n\nDr Pace was a scientist and he entered into an employment contract with a company called Biotechnology.\nThe contract provided that Dr Pace would receive a salary of $36,000 per annum, a company car and an option to participate in the Company’s senior staff equity sharing scheme.\nDr Pace was aware that at the time he accepted the offer of employment the Scheme didn’t exist but the company had plans to introduce it.\n\nWhen his employment was terminated, he sued the company for damages for its failure to give him the option of participating in the equity sharing scheme.\n\n\nRelevant issues before the Court:\n\nWas the disputed clause so uncertain that it cannot be enforced?\n\n\nWas the disputed clause so devoid of meaning and so dependent upon the initiatives and decision of Biotechnology Australia as to be illusory?\nKirby J - Uncertainty\n\nKirby J made some general observations about the task of courts in trying to resolve uncertainty in contracts.\n\nEvery case depends upon its own facts. The meaning of an agreement must be discovered objectively.\n\nIf there is ambiguity or vagueness, regard to extrinsic evidence might give meaning to the term\n\n\nCourts will try to uphold the agreements and avoid frustrating the wishes of the parties, but only so far as those wishes may be ascertained from the agreement between them\nCourts will not uphold agreements where the court is asked to spell out to an unacceptable extent that which the parties have themselves failed to agree;\n\nclarify that which is too obscure and accept for itself a discretion which the parties by their agreement reserved to one of both of them\n\n\nJudges will differ in opinion about whether a court can give effect to an uncertain term and there is no objectively right decision in such cases.\nThe decisions are based on the features of the agreement, the relationship between the parties and relevant external reference points in order to resolve an uncertain term\n\n\n\n\nApplication of legal principles to the facts\n\nWas the disputed clause so uncertain of content that it could not be enforced?\n\n‘It was nonetheless void for uncertainty because the challenged term contained within it too many elements which are uncertain…the bare bones of the promise to establish such a scheme leave too mant decisions to be made for a court to attempt to give content to the promise by substituting its opinion of a fair scheme…\nThere are too many features of apparent peculiarity in which schemes …\n\nto make it safe to conclude that an objectively ascertainable external standard exists.’\n\n\n\n\nThe court found that there were too many elements which were uncertain such as:\n\nHow many shares in Biotech were to be devoted to the scheme?\nWhat class of shares were to be held by the likes of Pace?\nWhat were the terms of the options upon which the shares would issue?\nWhat rights would attach to the shares?\nUpon what terms were they acquired and could they be disposed of?\n\n\nThere were too many gaps to fill in which the parties themselves did not fill, and in this basis the term was unenforceable.\n\n\nApplication of legal principles to the facts\n\nWas the disputed clause so devoid of meaning and so dependent upon the initiatives and decisions of Biotechnology Australia as to be illusory?\n\n‘The problem for the court is that the term is just too uncertain of content.’\nThe ‘fulfilment of the term relating to the equity sharing scheme depended upon the decision of one party, namely Biotechnology.\nThere was no external standard to fix an “appropriate” or “reasonable” equity participation scheme.’\nThe ‘existence of other schemes in other companies with other products and other scientists provides no such reference point’\n\n\n\n\nBiotechnology Australia Pty Ltd v Pace (1988) 15 NSWLR 130 (Court of Appeal)\n\nMcHugh JA (applied similar reasoning to Kirby P):\n\nThe promise is too illusory or too vague and uncertain to be enforceable.\nThe parties recognised that Biotech would decide both the nature of the scheme and the rights of the individuals participating in it.\nThere is no standard by which a court could determine in any meaningful sense whether such a promise was broken.\n\n\nHope JA (dissent):\n\nBiotech was required to give Pace an option on terms which it had honestly arrived at.\nThe role of staff equity sharing schemes in employment contracts is sufficiently well established to enable courts to apply the concept of reasonableness to them.\nThe schemes are more complex than bonuses but that merely makes the resolution of the problem more difficult;\n\nit does not deny the possibility of resolution.\n\n\nConcluded that the promise was valid - ’… in my opinion the proper conclusion at this stage of the hearing is that as there was a valid and enforceable contractual promise on the part of Biotech to establish a senior staff equity sharing scheme and that the promise was not unenforceable for uncertainty or as being illusory…’\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsequences of uncertainty\n\nIf the terms of an agreement are incomplete, uncertain or illusory, the consequences that can flow include:\n\nThe whole agreement is VOID\n\nIf the terms of an agreement are incomplete, uncertain or illusory, the courts look at how essential the term is and the intention of the parties in order to determine whether the entire agreement is void.\n\n\n\n\nSEVERANCE – the ineffective term can be severed from the rest of the agreement\n\nThe problematic term can be severed from the rest of the agreement, and the remaining terms are able to be performed and enforced.\nThe court will take into account the essentiality of the term and whether severing it is consistent with the intention of the parties.\n\nIf severing the clause changes the agreement into something the parties did not agree to, the court will not allow that.\n\n\nEg: Whitlock v Brew: If the court had severed clause 5 of the contract, it would have turned the sale into something different from what the parties contemplated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormalities\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nSimple contract\n\nRequires consideration to be

May &amp; Baker (Australia) Pty Ltd (1966) 115 CLR 353\n\n‘The question is whether the effect of an exception clause in a contract is to absolve a party from liability for the consequences of a breach of duty, or whether its effect is to define substantively the limits of his duty by negativing obligations that the law would otherwise impose and undertakings that it would otherwise imply.\n\nThe answer in any given case may, I think, depend upon the actual words of the contract.’ 385 (Windeyer J)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nALSO KNOWN AS\n\n‘Exclusion clauses’ also known as:\n\n‘Exemption

HOSTILITY\n\nPhoto Production Ltd v Securicor Transport Ltd [1980] AC 827\n\n‘My Lords, the reports are full of cases in which what would appear to be very strained constructions have been placed upon exclusion clauses, mainly in what to-day would be called consumer contracts and contracts of adhesion.\nAs Lord Wilberforce has pointed out, any need for this kind of judicial distortion of the English language has been banished by Parliament’s having made these kinds of contracts subject to the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977.‘851 (Lord Wilberforce)\n\n\n\n\n\nCONSUMER PROTECTION\n\nConsumer

CLR 500\n\nLeading case on construction of exclusion clauses.\nFacts\n\nDelco retained Darlington to trade on the futures market on its behalf.\nWritten contract contained:\nExclusion clause\nLimitation of liability clause.\nDarlington five principles for exclusions\n\nNatural and ordinary means\nIn light of the contract as a whole\nContext of the market\nNature and object of the contract\nWhere appropriate use contra preferentum\n\n\nClause 6 (Exclusion clause):\n‘The Client … acknowledges that the Agent will not be responsible for any loss arising in any way out of any trading activity undertaken on behalf of the Client whether pursuant to this Agreement or not\nClause 7(c) (Limitation clause):\n‘Any liability on the Agent’s part … for damages for or in respect of any claim arising out of or in connection with the relationship established by this agreement or any conduct under it or any orders or instructions given to the Agent by the Client … shall not in any event (and whether or not such liability results from or involves negligence) exceed one hundred dollars.’\nDelco authorised Darlington to enter ‘day trading’ transactions, that should have been ‘closed out’ within 24-hour of entering them.\nDarlington breached the contract by not closing out certain transactions within 24 hours.\nCaused Delco loss of $280,000.\nDarlington relied on Cl 6 and 7(c) to exclude/limit liability.\n\n\nClause 6 (Exclusion clause) did not totally exclude liability.\n‘The Client … acknowledges that the Agent will not be responsible for any loss arising in any way out of any trading activity undertaken on behalf of the Client whether pursuant to this Agreement or not .\nClause 7(c) (Limitation clause) did limit liability.\n‘Any liability on the Agent’s part … for damages for or in respect of any claim arising out of or in connection with the relationship established by this agreement or any conduct under it or any orders or instructions given to the Agent by the Client … shall not in any event (and whether or not such liability results from or involves negligence) exceed one hundred dollars.’\nInterpretation\n\nNatural and Ordinary Meaning: Both the sign and the ticket seem to exclude liability quite broadly. The wording covers damages, losses, or injuries and doesn’t limit the scope of incidents from which the car park seeks to exclude its liability.\nContra Proferentem: If any ambiguity were found in the clauses, the interpretation should not favor Lodge Carpark.\nThe court accepted that this clause effectively limited Darlington’s liability.\n\nThis meant that any potential damages payable by Darlington to Delco would be capped at 100, even though the actual loss suffered by Delco was significantly more (280,000).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTRA PROFERENTUM\n\n‘contra’ = against.\nproferens’ = the party relying on an exclusion clause.\n‘contra proferentum’ = term will be construed strictly against the party relying on the exclusion clause.\n\ncontra preferens\n\n\nZhang v ROC Services (NSW) Pty Ltd (2016) 93 NSWLR 561\n\nthe rule is one of last resort … If after ascertaining the literal or grammatical meanings and evaluating them against the text, context and purpose of the contract, there is still real doubt, then a clause is to be construed against the person who drafted it.’ 591 [140] (Leeming JIA)\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLES OF CONTRA PROFERENTUM\n\nDarlington represents the modern approach to construing exclusion clauses.\nOlder cases:\n\nContained ‘rules’ that no longer apply as hard rules.\nProvide examples of how exclusion clauses may be construed contra proferentum.\n\n\n\n\n\nLIMITING THE CAUSE OF ACTION\n\nDonoghue v Stevenson [19321 AC 562\n\n‘The fact that there is a contractual relationship between the parties which may give rise to an action for breach of contract, does not exclude the co-existence of a right of action founded on negligence as between the same parties, independently of the contract, though arising out of the relationship in fact brought about by the contract.’ 609 (Lord Macmillan)\n\n\nWhite v John Warwick &amp; co Ltd [1953] 1 WLR 1285\n\nWhite hired a tricycle from John Warwick.\nCl 2: ‘the owners agree to maintain the machine in working order and conditions .\nCI 11: ‘Nothing in this agreement shall render the owners liable for any personal injuries to the riders of the machines hired …\n\nJohn Warwick negligently repaired the tricycle, which injured White.\n\n\n2 causes of action:\n\nBreach of contract (cl 2)\nNegligence (tort)\nWhite sued in both causes of action.\n\n\nJohn Warwick: cl 11 excludes liability in both causes of action.\nCourt held that it excluded liability for breach of contract only.\nLanguage did not clearly exclude liability for tort as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nDEVIATION\n\nThomas National Transport (Melbourne) Pty Ltd v May &amp; Baker (Australia) Pty Ltd (1966) 115 CLR 353\n\nMay hired TNT to deliver goods from Melbourne to interstate destinations.\nPay (contractor) picked up the goods from May to deliver to TNT’s Melbourne distribution centre.\nPay arrived after the centre had closed for the day.\nPay stored the goods in his own garage overnight.\nGarage caught fire and the goods were damaged.\nMay sued for breach of contract.\nCI 6:\n\nno responsibility will be accepted by the Carrier for any loss of, or damage to, or mis-delivery or non-delivery of goods, parcels, packages, crates or cases, etc., or the contents thereof either in transit or in storage for any reason whatsoever.’\n\n\nDeparted from the way the contract was formed, so cannot hide behind exclusion clause\n\n\n\n\n\n4 corners\n\nGibaud v Great Eastern Railway co [1921] 2 KB 426\n\nif you undertake to do a thing in a certain way, or to keep a thing in a certain place, with certain condition protecting it, and have broken the contract by not doing the thing contracted for in the way contracted for, or not keeping the article in the place in which you have contracted to keep it, you cannot rely on the conditions which were only intended to protect you if you carried out the contract in the way in which you had contracted to do it.’ 435 (Scrutton LJ)\n\n\nSydney Corporation v West (1965) 114 CLR 481\n\nWest parked his car in a carpark operated by Sydney City Council.\nParties entered a contract of bailment.\nThe Council gave West a ticket on entry:\n\nPresent to attendant to release car.\n‘The Council does not accept any responsibility for the loss or damage to any vehicle or for loss of or damage to any article or thing in or upon any vehicle or for any injury to any person however such loss, damage or injury may arise or be caused.’\n\n\nRogue:\n\nFraudulently obtained a ticket for a non-existent car.\nStole West’s car.\nUsed the ticket to exit the carpark with West’s car.\n\n\nIf the gate attendant had checked the ticket, would have seen that the licence plate number was incorrect.\nWest sued for breach of contract.\n\n‘Such a clause contemplates that loss or damage may occur by reason of negligence … in carrying out the obligations created by the contract.

stipulated event will always result in the defeat of the main object of the contract, there will be no scope for holding that that object requires the conclusion that the exempting clause is not applicable to that event.\nBut even in cases where the occurrence of the events stipulated in the exemption clause will not always defeat the main object of the contract, the nature of those events may nevertheless give rise to the inference that the clause was intended to apply to those events even when they occur in circumstances which defeat the main object of the contract.’ 227\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nDarlington is the leading modern authority on construing exclusion clauses.\nConstrue exclusion clauses using the ordinary principles of construction.\nIf the clause is ambiguous, then it may be construed contra proferentum.\nOlder cases are examples of how clauses may be read down, not binding rules.\nA clearly drafted exclusion clause may be of wide scope.\n\n\n\nImplied terms\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nImplied terms are as valid as express terms:\nDamages can be awarded for breach.\nRight to terminate may be conferred if the implied term is a condition.\n\n\nHart v MacDonald (1910) 10 CLR 417\n\nan implication is as much a part of a contract as any term couched in express words.’ (430, Isaacs J)\n\n\nCourts cautiously find implied terms as they do not want to rewrite the contract.\nException: Legislation may provide that it cannot be contracted out of.\nServcorp WA Pty Ltd v Perron Investments Pty Ltd (2016) 50 WAR 226\n\n‘The requirement that an alleged implied term not ‘contradict’ any express term plainly includes a direct contradiction.\nHowever, the requirement has a broader connotation.\nFor example, a term cannot be implied if it is apparent, on the face of the document, that the parties adverted to the point in question and either deliberately rejected it or deliberately refrained from dealing with it.’ (257, Buss\n\n\nHart v MacDonald (1910) 10 CLR 417\n\n‘[An entire agreement clause] excludes what is extraneous to the written contract: but it does not in terms exclude implications arising on a fair construction of the agreement itself, and in the absence of definite exclusion, an implication is as much a part of a contract as any term couched in express words.’ (430, Isaacs J)\n\n\nIf the court will not find the implied term then there is a gap in the contract.\n\nOne party will likely wear the loss / inconvenience.\nContract may fail:\n\nUncertain /

they turned their minds to it — it is not a term that they have actually agreed upon.’ 346 (Mason J)\nFinding implied terms risks making a court an author.\nThe court mitigates this risk by:\n\nViewing implication of terms as part of the process of construction (ie, discerning the parties’ intentions from express terms.)\nImposing high barriers to the implication of terms.\n\n\n\n\nNECESSARY FOR BUSINESS EFFICACY\n\nThe Moorcock (1889) 14 PD 64\n\nPlaintiff shipowner moored at a jetty of defendant wharf-owner.\nBoth parties knew that the ship would rest on Thames riverbed at low tide.\n\nShip was damaged when it rested on hard ridge in the riverbed.\nPlaintiff argued that there was an implied term that the ship could safely moor at the jetty at low tide.\n\n\nBoth parties knew that the ship would rest on the riverbed at low tide.\nIt was obvious that no shipowner would moor at an unsafe jetty.\n\nOnly the defendants could discover whether the riverbed was safe and take steps to make it safe.\n\n\nTherefore, they impliedly promised either that:\n\nIt was safe to moor at the jetty; or\nThat they would warn the plaintiff if it was not safe.\n\n\n\n\nSekisui Rib Loc Australia Pty Ltd v Rocla Pty Ltd (2012) 291 ALR 140\n\n‘The necessity to give “business efficacy” contemplates a term needed “in order to make the agreement work, or

that the contract can operate without it.’ 153 [50] (Sulan J)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREASONABLE AND EQUITABLE\n\nBP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings (1977) 180 CLR 266\n\nBP (Westernport) entered a rate agreement with the Shire of Hastings for the construction and operation of a refinery in the local government area.\nThe agreement required significant capital investment by BP (Westernport) and performance of obligations for at least 20 years.\n\nThe Council promised reduced rates for at least 40 years.\n\n\nAfter a few years, BP (Westernport) was wound up.\n\nAnother company in the BP group assumed control of the refinery.\n\n\nThe Council levied the new BP company with full rates.\n\nCouncil argued that the rates agreement contained an implied term that the contract would terminate if BP (Westernport) ceased occupying the refinery.\n\n\nThe term was not reasonable and equitable:\n\nCouncil had enjoyed significant economic benefits from the development of the refinery.\nCouncil induced the BP group to invest based on the promised 40-year rate reduction.\nForeseeable that the BP group might restructure in that period.\nIt made no difference to the Council which of the group operated the refinery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOBVIOUSNESS AND CLARITY\n\nShirlaw v Southern Foundries (1926) Ltd [1939] 2 KB 206\n\nPrima facie that which in any contract is left to be implied and need not be expressed is something so obvious that it goes without saying;\n\nso that, if while the parties were making their bargain, an officious bystander were to suggest some express provision for it in the agreement, they would testily suppress him with a common, ‘Oh, of course’.’ 227 (MacKinnon LJ)\n\n\n\n\nCLARITY\n\nServcorp WA Pty Ltd v Perron Investments Pty Ltd (2016) 50 WAR 226\n\n‘The requirement that an alleged implied term be capable of clear expression overlaps with the requirement of obviousness.\nA term which is incapable of clear expression is

Ltd v Shire of Hastings (1977) 180 CLR 266\n\nfor a term to be implied, the following conditions (which may overlap) must be satisfied (BP Refinery Test loosley):\nImplied term interpretation construction loosley:\nFormal term interpretation construction strictly:\n\n(1) it must be reasonable and equitable;\n(2) it must be necessary to give business efficacy (got to make it work) to the contract, so that no term will be implied if the contract is effective without it;\n(3) it must be so obvious that “it goes without saying”;\n(4) it must be capable of clear expression;\n(5) it must not contradict any express term of the contract.’ 282-3 (Lord Simon of Glaisdale for the majority)\n\n\nApply the BP Refinery test (all 5 conditions) when implying a term into a formal contract.\nThe

CLR 226\n\n‘There must be evidence that the custom relied on is so well known and acquiesced in that everyone making a contract in that situation can reasonably be presumed to have imported that term

The law can imply terms in two ways\n\nFirst, the common law can imply terms, provided that the implied terms are not inconsistent with the express terms.\nSecond - and perhaps more commonly these days - legislation can imply terms into contract. Terms implied by legislation often cannot be contracted out of.\ndoThird, and perhaps most commonly, they can be implied based upon the presumed intention of the parties as evidenced in the express terms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 7: Termination by agreement, Breach and repudiation\n\nDischarge, termination of contract\n\nA contract may be ended in 3 ways:\n\nDischarged by full performance\nTerminated before full performance\nBy agreement\nBecause of breach or repudiation\nFrustrated\nConsent vitiated\n\n\nThe contract is ‘terminated’ when:\n\nTermination by agreement\nTermination because of breach or repudiation\nTermination by frustration\n\n\nLegal effect: parties are released\nMcDonald v Dennys Lascelles Ltd (1933) 48 CLR 457\n\nthe contract is not rescinded as from the beginning.\nThis case is significant in Australian contract law regarding the right to terminate a contract for repudiation.\n\n\nRESCISSION\n\nThe contract is ‘rescinded’ when a party whose consent was impaired elects to void the contract.\nRescinding the contract voids everything done under the contract.\nParties must be restored to their pre-contractual positions.\n\n\n\n\nDISCHARGE BY PERFORMANCE\n\nMost contracts are discharged by being performed.\nFull performance does not make the contract disappear.\nSecondary terms can continue to bind the parties. Eg, confidentiality clauses, dispute resolution clauses, etc.\nTo assess whether a contract is performed, it must be construed to determine:\n\nWhat parties are obliged to do.\nWhen those obligations must be performed.\n\n\nTendered performance is then measured against that proper construction.\nDEPENDANT AND CONCURRENT\n\nWhere mutually dependant obligations are performed simultaneously\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\nMost contracts are discharged by performance.\nConstrue the contract to work out what the parties must do and when.\nMost contracts consist of dependant obligations.\nIf the contract is performed, then it does not disappear.\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION TO TERMINATION BY AGREEMENT\n\nPrinting and Numerical Registering Co v Sampson (1875) LR 19 Eq 462\nINTRODUCTION\n\nTermination by agreement rests on mutual consent.\nTermination for breach/repudiation: unilateral act of one party in response to failure to perform by the other.\nFrustration: automatic termination by the law in response to a frustrating event.\nTermination by agreement can be achieved by:\n\nPower granted by a term in the contract.\nExpressly or impliedly agreeing to end a contract by entering into another contract.\nA contract may also be varied by entering a further agreement.\n\n\n\n\nTERMINATION BY CONTRACTUAL TERM\n\nEXPRESS POWER\n\nParties can agree to terms conferring a power to terminate.\n\nAt will: Contract is immediately terminable at any time.\nWith notice: A party provides notice and the contract expires after the agreed notice period.

(Dowsett J)\n\nThe focus must be upon the conduct in question and not upon the range of activities in which a relevant corporation may be engaged.\nIn other words, one does not simply identify the conduct in question, note that the relevant corporation is engaged in commercial activity of some kind, then look for a connection between the two.\n\nBecause corporations are usually formed to engage in commercial activities, it will rarely be difficult to find such a connection.\nThe correct approach is to determine whether or not the relevant conduct can, according to ordinary usage, be described as having occurred in the course of dealings “…which, of their nature, bear a trading or commercial character”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUltimately a question of fact.\nNote: only the defendant needs to be acting in trade or commerce: not the plaintiff.\nLubidineuse v Bevanere Pty Ltd (1984) 3 FCR 1\n\n‘In determining whether, in a particular case, that test is met it is relevant to consider inter alia the character of the parties involved – which I assume to include whether they are people who have engaged, or are about to engage, in commercial activities – whether the transaction is motivated by business, as distinct from personal, reasons and whether the person whose conduct is under attack played an active part in the transaction.’ (12, Wilcox J)\n\n\nBevanere Pty Ltd v Lubidineuse (1985) 7 FCR 325\n\n‘The sale of the clinic should not be viewed in isolation from the totality of the appellant’s commercial activities\nThe mere fact that it was the sale of a capital asset did not deprive it of its character as a transaction in trade or commerce.’\nBut that is not to say that a corporation must engage in multiple transactions of a similar kind for it to be engaged in trade or commerce\nIn our opinion, the making of the arrangements necessary to dispose of the clinic were part and parcel of the totality of the appellant’s activities in trade or commerce.’\nBut if the transaction is motivated by business, then it may be trade or commerc\n\n\nHoughton v Arms (2006) 225 CLR 553\n\nwhile in most cases, the focus would be on the nature of the business of the party making the representation, [s 18] was not so limited;\n\nin particular, the section did not, in terms, refer to the trade or commerce of any particular corporation\n\n\n\n\nTobacco Institute of Australia Ltd v Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations Inc (1992) 38 FCR 1\n\n‘There can be no doubt that a corporation, formed to promote the interests of a particular industry or whose activities are directed at representing members of that industry in promotional activities, acts “in trade or commerce” when conveying representations about that industry’s product to the general public.’\n\n\nExceptions\n\n“Private” sales of land not in the course of a business or money-making activity.

Thus, out of the various means by which consent may be obtained – advice, persuasion, influence, inducement, representation, commercial pressure - the law has come to select some which it will not accept as a reason for voluntary action: fraud, abuse of relation of confidence, undue influence, duress or coercion.’ (Lord Wilberforce and Lord Simon of Glaisdale (Dissent))\n\n\nThe mere fact that pressure is applied – even overwhelming pressure – or that parties bargain from unequal bargaining positions is not sufficient to amount to duress.\nCrescendo Management v Westpac (1988) 19 NSWLR 40\n\n‘The proper approach in my opinion is to: ask whether any applied pressure induced the victim to enter into the contract and then ask whether that pressure went beyond what the law is prepared to countenance as legitimate?\n\nPressure will be illegitimate if it consists of unlawful threats … But the categories are not closed.\n\n\nEven overwhelming pressure, not amounting to unconscionable or unlawful conduct, however, will not necessarily constitute economic duress.’ (McHugh JA)\n\n\nANZ Banking Group Ltd v Karam (2005) 64 NSWLR 149\n\n[66] The vagueness inherent in the terms “economic duress” and “illegitimate pressure” can be avoided by treating the concept of “duress” as limited to threatened or actual unlawful conduct.\nThe threat or conduct in question need not be directed to the person or property of the victim, narrowly identified, but can be to the legitimate commercial and financial interests of the party.

We looked at these concepts of termination for breach and repudiation in Module 7.\nSecond, the law can order the defaulting party to pay damages in place of performance, or it can order the defaulting party to specifically perform it.\n\n\n\n\nImpaired consent def\n\nIf a party is bound to a contract that they did not properly consent to, then the law provides a remedy in the form of rescission.\n\n\n\n\nTERMINATION / RESCISSION\n\nTERMINOLOGY\n\nTerminate def/ Termination def\n\nUsed to describe the legal effect of:\nA party’s decision to end a contract because of breach or repudiation.\nA frustrating event.\n\n\nRescind def / rescission def\n\nUsed to describe the legal effect of a party’s decision to void a contract because of a vitiating factor.\n\n\nHighfield Property Investments Pty Ltd v Commercial &amp; Residential Developments (SA) Pty Ltd [2012] SASC 165\n\nThe word “rescission” is ambiguous.

or\nAffirm (and continue to be bound by) the contract.\n\n\nOnce the choice is unequivocally made, the plaintiff cannot change their mind.\nEg, if a plaintiff has elected to affirm the contract, then rescission or termination is no longer possible.\n\n\nA binding election requires:\n\n\n\nFull knowledge of the ‘material facts’ (ie, at least knowledge of the vitiating conduct; maybe also knowledge of the right to rescind.)\n\n\nUnequivocal conduct indicating affirmation or rescission/termination\nConduct is judged objectively:\n\nthere is no need for the plaintiff to subjectively intend to elect.\n\n\n\n\nSargent v ASL Developments Ltd (1974) 131 CLR 634\n\nTerm in contract for the sale of land provided a right to terminate if certain planning controls were imposed over the land.\nThe planning controls were imposed.\nDespite this, the sellers continued to perform the contract.\n32 months later, the sellers purported to terminate the contract, relying on the term.\n\n‘The words or conduct ordinarily required to constitute an election must be unequivocal in the sense that it is consistent only with the exercise of one of the two sets of rights and inconsistent with the exercise of the other … For an election there need be no actual, subjective intention to elect … an election is the effect which the law attributes to conduct justifiable only if such an election had been made\n\n\n\n\nTropical Traders Ltd v Goonan (1964) 111 CLR 41\n\nContract for the sale of land provided for payment of the price in instalments over 5 years.\nTime was of the essence for payment of the balance on 6 January 1963.\n6 Jan: Purchaser failed to pay and asked for 3 more months.\nSeller: ‘The company will not take action under the contract until Monday, 14 January\n\n\nTropical Traders Ltd v Goonan (1964) 111 CLR 41\n\n‘The company will not take action under the contract until Monday, 14 January but this must be regarded as an act of grace on the part of the Company and without prejudice to and in no way varying the Company’s right to strict enforcement of the contract.’\n\n\nImmer (No 145) Pty Ltd v Uniting Church in Australia Property Trust (NSW) (1993) 182 CLR 26\n\nSale of air rights subject to Council approval by 1 April 1989.\nApproval not granted by 1 April: both parties in a position to terminate.\n26 June: Immer sends settlement documents to the\nTrust under mistaken belief that the Council had approve the transfer.\n26 August: Immer terminates the contract.\n\nWere its actions consistent only with an intention to keep the agreement on foot and inconsistent with the exercise of the right to rescind\n\n\n‘If a party to a contract, faced with the choice of terminating the contract or keeping it on foot, terminates the contract that party will ordinarily have acted in a way that leaves no doubt as to the choice made.’ (41, Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ)\n\n’… at the heart of election is the idea of confrontation which in turn produces the necessity of making a choice.\nBut in a case such as the present one, the choice is not merely one of affirming the agreement;

Ready, Willing and Able\n\nFocusing now on the right to terminate for breach or repudiation, the party who has such a right will not be able to terminate the contract if they are not ready, willing and able to perform it.\nA plaintiff who wishes to elect for breach or repudiation must be ‘ready, willing and able’ to perform their own obligations at the time of election.\n\nPsaltis v Schultz (1948) 76 CLR 547\n\n‘To be ready and willing to perform a contract a party must not only be disposed to do the act promised but also have the capacity to do it.\nBut the tenor of the promise will show when and how the act is to be performed and it is to that time and mode of performance that the capacity and disposition to fulfil the promise are to be directed.’ (560, Dixon J)\n\n\n\n\nThe extent to which the plaintiff must be ready, willing and able to perform depends upon the circumstances.\n\nWas the plaintiff was due to perform any essential obligations before or at the time of the

against doing in the future what the contract requires is counted as an absence of readiness and willingness.’ (481, Dixon J)\n\n\nPsaltis v Schultz (1948) 76 CLR 547\n\nIt is enough that he is not presently incapacitated from future performance and is not indisposed to do, when the time comes, what the contract requires.\n\n\nForan v Wight (1989) 168 CLR 385\n\nSellers repudiated (anticipatory breach) 2 days before settlement.\nPurchasers waited for settlement – neither parties attempted to settle.\nPurchasers terminated for actual breach 2 days after settlement.\nSellers argued that plaintiffs were not ready, willing and able at the time the purchasers terminated.\n\n\nSharjade Pty Ltd v Commonwealth [2009] NSWCA 373\n\n[68] As a matter of principle, it seems to me that the view of Deane J is preferable.\nIf the only question is whether a purported termination is effective to put an end to the contract so as to discharge both parties from future performance, then anticipatory breach by one will justify termination by the other whether or not the latter is ready and willing to perform.\nHowever, if the latter wants to obtain any relief on the basis of the termination, beyond mere discharge of future obligations, then as part of its cause of action it must prove readiness, willingness and ability. (Hodgson JA, Young JA agreeing at [145])\nA further and more difficult question is whether … a party who is also in breach of the contract … can terminate despite its own breach.\n\nThe answer is that generally it can, at least unless the obligations breached are interdependent or the breach by the party wishing to terminate has caused the breach that this party wishes to rely on.\n\n\n\n\nForan v Wight (1989) 168 CLR 385\n\n‘They were not required to show that upon the day stipulated for settlement they were ready and willing to tender the purchase price.\nThey were absolved from the obligation of placing themselves in a position to be able to tender the purchase price upon that day by reason of the representation of the vendors two days earlier.’ (454, Dawson J)\n\n‘All that the purchasers were required to show was that at the time of the repudiation, that is, at the time they were absolved from future performance, there was not a “substantial incapacity” on their part or a “definitive resolve or decision” against the performance of their obligations.’ (454, Dawson J)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRescission: Restitutio in integrum\n\nRESCISSION: INTERVENING THIRD PARTY\n\nFocusing now on the right to rescind because of a vitiating factor, rescission will not be allowed if the parties cannot be restored to their pre-contractual positions.\nRescission:\n\nVoids the contract.\nObliges the parties to restore each other to their pre- contractual positions.\nIf the parties cannot be restored, then rescission will be denied.\n\n\nExample\n\nSeller induces purchaser to buy a car with a fraudulent misrepresentation.\nPurchaser paints the car a different colour and negligently damages it.\nPurchaser discovers fraud.\n\n\nRescission may be denied if purchaser cannot return the care in the same condition as it was transferred to them.\nContracts tainted by a vitiating factor are voidable, not void.\n\nVoidable contracts allow title in property to pass, unless and until the contract is rescinded.\nIf the contract is not rescinded before that title is passed to an innocent third party, then the right to rescind is lost.\n\n\nOn rescission, ownership of property immediately reverts to original owner (plaintiff).\n\nPlaintiff can get property from whomever has possession of it\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActions for debt def\n\nWhen a party (the ‘contractor’) earns the right to payment for performance of an obligation.\n\nWhen a contractor earns a right to payment under a contract, the contractor can sue for payment in an action called ‘debt’.\nThat right to payment exists independently of the contract, hence, if the contract is terminated after a right to payment has accrued, then the contractor can still sue on the debt owing.\n\n\nACTIONS FOR DEBT\n\nContracts typically consist of the provision of goods/services for money.\nA right to payment depends upon proper performance.\nConstrue the contract to determine:\nNature of obligations (entire?

Negated beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\nAt the time of the act/omission causing death, A was suffering from a mental health impairment or cognitive impairment\n\n\nThis substantially impaired A’s capacity to understand events; to judge right from wrong; or to control her/himself.\n\n\nImpairment so substantial to warrant reduction of liability from murder to manslaughter.\n\n\nINVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER\nWhere A does not have the subjective MR for murder\nDifferentiation from murder\r\nSpecific elements\r\nUDA Manslaughter\n(s 18(1)(b), elements established at common law: see Wilson)\nA caused the death of V but did not possess the MR for murder.\r\nA’s voluntary act (not omission) caused the death of a person, and that act was:\n\n\nUnlawful (i.e., a breach of criminal law); and\n\n\nDangerous (a reasonable person would have realised they were exposing another to an appreciable risk of serious injury).\n\n\nNegligent manslaughter (s 18(1)(b), elements established at common law, can be committed by way of a positive act or omission: see Nydam)\r\nA caused the death of V but did not possess the MR for murder.\n\nA caused the death of a person by an act, or by an omission in a situation in which A owed V a duty of care; and\nA reasonable person in the position of A would have adverted to the risk that death or GBH would result from that act or omission (‘standard of care’); and\nThere was such a great falling short of the standard of care as to warrant criminal punishment (‘breach of duty’).\n\nJCE Problem questions\n\nWhen solving problems involving multiple participants:\n\nFirst analyse the criminal liability of the principal offender who fulfilled the actus reus elements of the crime.\nThen contemplate whether the other offender/s can be charged with being party to a JCE if there is an agreement or mutual understanding.\n\n\nThis is because liability is primary, not derivative, for participating in a JCE. In many cases it would be wise for the prosecution to pursue JCE first and accessorial liability as a ‘back up charge’.\n\nIf there is no agreement, then the Crown would be likely to assess whether D could be liable due to fulfilling the elements of accessorial liability (either as an ABF or P2), or potentially, through the doctrine of innocent agency.\nIt is also important to consider whether any additional offences have been committed by a co-accused that may not have been agreed to by the D, or which D did not participate in, but D may have contemplated as a possible incident of participating in the original enterprise (Extended JCE).\n\n\n\nSpecific Intent vs Basic Intent chart\nSpecific intent offences\r\nBasic (non-specific) intent offences\r\nSection 18(1)(a) -

The applicant’s violent actions led to the deceased’s demise after a struggle, raising questions about causation and the applicant’s mental state.\n\n\nFacts\n\nThe applicant attacked the deceased, prompting her to lock herself in the bathroom. The applicant forcibly broke down the door, resulting in a struggle that culminated in the deceased falling out of a window and dying.\n\n\nTests\n\noperating and substantial cause doctrine\n\nThis test requires that the accused’s act or omission must have been the operating and substantial cause of the prohibited consequence (in this case, the victim’s death) for criminal liability to be established.\nSubstantial and operating cause (SOC test)\n\nLarge enough to meaningfully contribute to death\nOngoing and still have an effect on the cause of death\nWork backwards: Barman died due to the fire caused by lighting newspapers\n\n\n\n\nHowever, in cases where the harm to the injured person would never have occurred but for a subsequent act of the victim or a third person.

The applicant’s actions induced fear in the deceased, potentially leading her to jump out of the window to evade violence.\n\n\nState of Mind and Accountability\n\nThe court considered whether the applicant had the intent to kill, cause harm, or was recklessly indifferent to the deceased’s life.\nThe court rejected arguments that lack of specific intent to kill or foreseeing the exact manner of death could absolve the applicant. The court highlighted that creating a situation intending harm resulting in death still held the applicant responsible.\n\n\nCausation and Timing\n\nThe court clarified that the relevant state of mind need not align precisely with the moment of death.\nThe trial judge’s directions, suggesting the opposite, were deemed incorrect.\nThe state of mind only had to accompany the act leading to death.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThe court granted special leave to appeal, considering significant legal principles discussed.\nHowever, the appeal was dismissed, affirming that the applicant’s actions reasonably led to the deceased’s death.\nThe court emphasized the relevance of the applicant’s state of mind to this outcome and clarified the temporal aspect of the relevant state of mind.\n\n\n\n\nJurisdictional issues\n\nIn New South Wales, there is now jurisdiction where there is ‘a territorial nexus’ between the state and the offence: Crimes Act (NSW) s 10C, inserted by the Crimes (Application of Criminal Law) Amendment Act 1992\nWard v R (1980) 142 CLR 308;\n\ntop of a steep bank of the River Murray, on the Victorian side of the river,\nshot and killed the deceased who was fishing by the river’s edge, some 30 feet below\n\nHigh Court held that the Victorian court did not have jurisdiction, the killing having taken place in New South Wales\n\n\nnot where the physical act of the accused is performed, but where that act takes effect upon its victim that determines the locus of a homicide.\n\n\nR v Graham\n\n\nThe actus reus of murder involves multiple elements that must be established to prove the defendant’s culpability. Actus reus elements typically include\n\nCausation: The defendant’s actions must have directly caused the death of the victim. Causation focuses on the cause-and-effect relationship between the defendant’s conduct and the victim’s death.\nConduct: The defendant’s conduct refers to the specific actions they took that resulted in the death. This involves detailing what the defendant did and how their actions led to the fatal outcome.\nOutcome: The outcome element refers to the fact that the victim died as a result of the defendant’s conduct. This establishes that the result was a direct consequence of the defendant’s actions.\n\n\nCase Summary:\n\nSwan v The Queen [2020] HCA 11\n\nBackground: The case involves the question of the appellant’s responsibility for the death of the victim, Mr. Kormilets.\nThe appellant, along with an accomplice, violently attacked the victim during a home invasion, causing severe injuries.\nThe victim’s subsequent quality of life was poor, and he eventually died from complications arising from a fractured hip.\nThe prosecution presented three causal pathways linking the appellant’s conduct to the victim’s death.\n\n\nFacts: The appellant and an accomplice attacked Mr. Kormilets during a home invasion, causing severe injuries. The victim’s quality of life declined, and he eventually broke his left femur. After deciding not to operate, he died from complications related to the fracture.\nTests: The case deals with the concept of causation and the establishment of a causal link between the appellant’s conduct and the victim’s death.\nLegal Principles: The prosecution presented three possible causal pathways to the jury, focusing on the decline in the victim’s quality of life due to the appellant’s initial assault.\n\nThe High Court affirmed that the law allows for a relevant causal link between the accused’s conduct and death, even if multiple steps, including decisions by victims, family members, and doctors, are involved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCausation and Decision-Making: The crucial point was whether the appellant’s attack caused a significant decline in the victim’s quality of life, leading to a decision not to medically intervene to prevent death from subsequent events.\nJurisdictional Issues: The case highlights the territorial jurisdiction of states in cases where the act leading to death occurs in one state, but death occurs in another.\n\nLegislation varies across states regarding jurisdiction in such cases.\n\n\nMens Rea of Murder: The text also briefly touches on the mens rea (mental element) of murder in New South Wales and Victoria, mentioning the different alternatives of intention and recklessness encompassed within this element.\n\n\nR v Smith [1959] 2 QB 36,\n\nif the second cause is so overwhelming as to make the original wound merely part of the history can it be said that the death does not flow from the wound.\nif the deceased had received proper treatment after he was stabbed, there was a 75 per cent chance he would have recovered.\n\n\nEvans and Gardiner (No. 2),\n\nDied 11 months after stabbing\nScar tissue from surgery - should have been diagnosed and treated (could be cured)\nupheld the applicant’s convictions for murder.\nabnormal treatment could be regarded as a supervening event which broke the causal chain\n\n\nR v Blaue [1975] 1 WLR 1411\n\nchain of causation was not broken because the victim of a stabbing, who was a Jehovah’s Witness, had refused to have a blood transfusion which would probably have saved her life\nReligion did not stop the injury from being stabbers fault\n\nThose who use violence on other people must take their victims as they find them.\nThis in our judgment means the whole man, not just the physical man.\nTake the victim as you find them, eggshell principle\n\n\n\n\nMalcherek and Steel\n\nTwo cases involving defendants charged with murder due to inflicted injuries and subsequent medical treatment.\nIn the first case, defendant stabbed his wife, leading to hospitalization; she later died after life support removal.\nIn the second case, defendant attacked a girl, causing severe head injuries; she died after life support disconnection.\nBoth defendants argued life support disconnection caused deaths.\nDefendants’ appeals dismissed; court emphasized competent medical treatment doesn’t absolve assailant if original injury remains a significant cause of death.\nPrecedent from R v Malcherek; R v Steel [1981] 2 All ER 422 supported court’s decision.\nOriginal injury’s causative impact persists despite medical decisions if it contributes to victim’s death.\n\n\nR v Jordan (1956) 40 Cr App R 152\n\na stabbing wound was stitched up but the victim died a week later.\ndeath had not been caused by the stab wound but by the introduction of terramycin after the deceased\nhad shown that he was intolerant of it and by the intravenous introduction of abnormal quantities of liquid

relevant\n\n\nR v Crabbe\n\nKnowledge vs. Probability:\n\nAn accused’s act, when knowing death or grievous harm is probable, aligns with an intent to kill or harm.\n\n\nProbability vs Possibility:\n\nMurder is considered when death is a probable outcome, not just possible.\n\n\nReckless Indifference:\n\nBeing indifferent to potential harm doesn’t equate to murder.\nKnowledge of

provocation\n\na killing under extreme provocation provides a partial defence for murder, resulting in a conviction of manslaughter: Crimes Act (NSW) s 23(1).\nIn 2014, amendments were introduced by the Crimes Amendment (Provocation) Act 2014 (NSW)\n\nchanging the name of the partial defence to ‘extreme provocation’ and making the requirements of the defence more stringent.\nThe amended provision introduced a new objective test.\n\nFor the partial defense to be available, the acts or omissions of the deceased must constitute extreme provocation to an ordinary person, and the accused must have lost self-control in response to these acts or omissions.\n\n\nExclusions:\n\nThe amendment explicitly excluded certain situations from the definition of “extreme provocation.”\nFor instance, non-violent sexual advances and the discovery, knowledge, or belief of a person’s sex or sexual orientation cannot be raised as grounds for extreme provocation.\n\n\nInducing or inciting one’s own death:\n\nActs done by or words used by the deceased that were incited by the accused for the purpose of providing an excuse to use violence against the deceased are also excluded from the grounds of extreme provocation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrationale for provocation\nManslaughter with the proper mens rea for murder\n\nHowever formed mens rea as a loss of self-control due to provocative conduct\nCannot be premeditated\n\nParker v R (1963) 111 CLR 610\n\n\n\n\nIf not capable of controlling themselves, it is actually automatism\n\nMust still have been possible to control actions during passion\n\n\nPurpose of provocation is providing an appropriate offence label (that is, manslaughter) that reflects the lesser-degree of culpability of the offender\n\n\nThe partial defence of extreme provocation has three aspects:\n\n(1) there was a ‘trigger’; that is, there was an act of the deceased towards or affecting the accused that amounted to a serious indictable offence, and that is not excluded by s 23(3);\n(2) this trigger caused the accused to lose self-control (which is assessed subjectively); and\n(3) the conduct of the deceased could have caused an ordinary person to lose self-control to the extent of intending to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm on the deceased (which is assessed objectively)\n\n\nProcedural issues\n\nExtreme provocation becomes relevant only if the prosecution has otherwise proven all the elements of murder.\n\n\nTrigger for the loss of self-control\n\nTriggers for provocations\n\n‘Conduct of the deceased towards or affecting the accused’\nR v Davis (1998) 100 A Crim R 573.\n\nKilled someone that stepdaughter told assaulted her and 5 year old neice.\nDavis killed deceased while sleeping later days\n\nHeld in R v Quartly (1986) 11 NSWLR 332, that hearsay provocation does not amount to provocative conduct within the meaning of the Crimes Act (NSW).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‘Serious indictable offence’\nconduct of the deceased must constitute a ‘serious indictable offence’\nAccording to the Crimes Act (NSW) s 4(1), a serious indictable offence is an ‘indictable offence that is punishable by imprisonment for life or for a term of 5 years or more’\n\n\nExclusions\n\nThe conduct was only a non-violent sexual advance to the accused\n\nGreen v R (1997) 191 CLR 334; 148 ALR 659 (at 6.40C), Green killed the deceased after the deceased made an unwanted homosexual advance towards him\n\nunlikely that the kind of homosexual advance that occurred in Green could amount to a serious indictable offence\n\n\nthe High Court held that words alone could amount to provocation and that it was not necessary for there to be a physical act to give rise to the defense.\n\n\n\n\nThe accused incited conduct\n\nIn R v Allwood, the accused deliberately sought out the deceased and was determined to have a confrontation.\n\nOnly if the hostile reaction goes beyond the reasonably predictable can provocation that is itself provoked be fit for consideration by a jury.\n\n\n\n\nWords alone?\n\nAfter 2014, the requirement in s 23(2)(b) that the provocative or ‘triggering’ conduct by the deceased must amount to a serious indictable offence (discussed at 6.31) is likely to prevent an accused from successfully raising provocation in many situations involving words alone\nMoffa v R (1977) 138 CLR 60\n\nWife became indifferent to husband, wife was going to leave family\nBegged wife not to leave family\nInsulting words Moffa v The Queen (1977) 138 CLR 601, 620-621 Mason J requires “close scrutiny of claims of provocation founded in words, rather than in conduct.” b/c words easier to fake claim\n\n\nR v R (1981) 28 SASR 321\n\nWoman was not present, but daughters were raped by husband\nKilled husband\n\nJudge found that jury should have decided bc she was not present, almost hearsay\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ‘trigger’ caused the accused to lose self-control\n\nThere must be some evidence that the accused was, in fact, acting under provocation.\naccused cannot assert that the situation would have aroused the ire of another, although it in fact left them unmoved.\n\n\nTiming between the triggering conduct and the (actual) loss of self-control\nProvocation includes ‘slow-burn’ response to long-term domestic violence: see R v Muy Ky Chhay (1994) 72 A Crim R 1.\n\ndoes not remove the requirement that the accused must have subjectively lost self-control\n\n\nSelf-induced intoxication and the loss of self-control\n\nHowever, self-induced intoxication is now irrelevant to this question.\n\nThis is set out in s 23(5) of the Crimes Act (NSW),\n\n\n\n\nThe ordinary person test\n\nThe law requires that the conduct of the deceased could have caused an ordinary person to lose self-control (the ordinary person test), to ensure there is a control on the circumstances that can reduce murder to manslaughter.\nFrom Stingel v R (1990) 171 CLR 31\n\nThen\n\nMasciantonio v R (1995) 183 CLR 58; 129 ALR 575;\nR v Mankotia (2001) 120 A Crim R 492),\nthe High Court adopted a two-stage approach to the ordinary person test.\n\nThe first stage\ndetermine the gravity of the provocation assessed from the perspective of the accused\nThe second stage\na court must ask whether an ordinary person could have lost self-control to such an extent as to form the intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm and to act upon that intention as the accused did.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemoved two-stage test\n\nSection 23(2)(d) requires that ‘the conduct of the deceased could have caused an ordinary person to lose self-control to the extent of intending to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm on the deceased.\n\n\n\n\nSingh v R [2012] NSWSC 637\nChamanjot Singh was sentenced to just six years in prison for repeatedly slitting his

122;\n\naccused individuals were convicted of conspiring to import a significant amount of cannabis into Australia.\nOne of the accused claimed he had been under duress due to threats, which compelled him to participate in the criminal venture after discovering its illicit nature.\nThe trial judge had rightly considered both the subjective state of the accused and the objective test based on an “average person of ordinary firmness.”\n\n\nTaiapa v R (2009) 240 CLR 9\n\nTaiapa had a drug-related debt of $60,000 to his dealers, Tony and Salvatore.\n\nWhen he couldn’t repay the debt, the dealers threatened Taiapa’s partner’s life if he approached the police.\n\n\nCompulsion could not be held due to accused’s belief that police could not protect him\nThe lack of faith in police to protect his familyt was not sufficient to claim compulsion in committing the crime\n\n\nR v Turnball\n\n70 year old farmer held grudge against compliance officer for farm purposes\nShot compliance officer when trying to run away\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 4A: Involuntary Manslaughter\n\nInvoluntary manslaughter is the category of unlawful homicide where an accused lacks the mens rea for murder, but is regarded by the law as sufficiently culpable that they should still be held responsible for the death.\n\n(1) unlawful and dangerous act manslaughter (UDA); and\n(2) manslaughter by gross negligence\n\nManslaughter by omission\n\n\n\n\nUnlawful and dangerous act manslaughter\n\nconfine the concept of ‘unlawful act’ to those acts that are subject to criminal punishment and not simply to civil liability,\nAccepted

such property by that fire?\n\n\n\n\nR v Patton [1998] 1 VR 7\n\nThe accused was convicted of a number of offences, including burglary arising from a spate of criminal activity over the course of an afternoon.\nThe Crown alleged the accused had entered a building as a trespasser with ‘intent to assault and injure a person (in the premises)‘.\nOn appeal it was argued that the accused should not have been convicted of burglary because the intent relied on was an intent to commit a common assault, and that crime had been abolished in Victoria when the former s 37 of the Crimes Act (Vic) was repealed in 1985\n\nwe are satisfied that the Parliament did not intend, when it repealed s 37, to do more than remove the penalty which had been so prescribed.\nThe effect of the repeal was, we believe, to leave the offence of common assault as a common law offence capable of being tried on indictment and for which the penalty was at large.\n\n\n\n\nR v Venna [1976] QB 421;\n\nThe appellant was involved in a struggle with police officers who were attempting to arrest him.\nThe appellant fell to the ground and then proceeded to lash out wildly with his legs.\nIn doing so, he kicked the hand of one of the police officers, fracturing a bone.\nThe appellant claimed that he was kicking out in an attempt to get up off the ground, and that he did not intend his foot to strike the police officer.\n\nThe appellant was charged, inter alia, with assault occasioning actual bodily harm.\nThe trial judge directed the jury that they could find the appellant guilty if they found that he had lashed out with his feet ‘reckless as to who was there, not caring one iota as to whether he kicked somebody’.\nThe appellant was convicted, and appeale\n\n\nArgued on R v Lamb [1967] 2 All ER

that recklessness, which falls short of intention, is not enough to support a charge of battery, and argued that, there being no authority to the contrary\n\n\nHowever\n\nR v Bradshaw (1878) 14 Cox CC 83 can be read as supporting the view that unlawful physical force applied recklessly constitutes a criminal assault\nDid not support the arguments by appellant\n\n\n\n\nR v Coleman (1990) 19 NSWLR 467\n\nFacts:\n\nThe defendant was charged with maliciously inflicting bodily harm with the intent to have sexual intercourse.\nAt trial, the jury was instructed that an act is considered reckless if the accused realized there was a possibility of injury but chose to proceed anyway.\nThe defendant appealed, arguing that recklessness should require the realization of a probability (or likelihood) of injury, not just a mere possibility.\n\n\nLegal Context:\n\nThe High Court, in the case R v Crabbe, had clarified that for the crime of murder, the recklessness test should be based on the probability of causing death.\nHowever, it was generally accepted in Australia that for statutory offenses other than murder, recklessness could be established if the accused realized that some harm might possibly result from their actions.\nThis distinction arose from cases like R v Cunningham and R v Mowatt.\n\n\nHunt J emphasized that the degree of reckless indifference required for murder is distinctly different from that needed for lesser offenses.\n\nWhile the realization of the probable consequence of death is essential for murder, the same standard doesn’t apply to lesser crimes from a legal, logical, or commonsensical perspective.\n\n\nOutcome:\n\nThe appeal was dismissed, with Finlay and Allen JJ concurring.\nThis means the court upheld the definition of recklessness as the realization of the possibility (not probability) of harm for the crime in question.\nThis essentially solidified the understanding that the test for recklessness in common assault is a subjective one.\n\nThe accused must have foreseen the possibility of the assault (even if they didn’t intend for it to happen).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR v Campbell [1997] 2 VR 585\n\nIn a dispute involving the accused, a gun was discharged, injuring a man.\n\nThe accused was convicted of recklessly causing serious injury but appealed, citing jury misdirection by the trial judge on the nature of “recklessness.”\nThe Court of Appeal agreed, clarifying that the correct measure is knowing an injury “probably will” occur, not just “might” occur.\nThe appeal was allowed, and a new trial was ordered.\n\nThis interpretation was later supported in Victoria but rejected in New South Wales.\nR v Coleman (1990) 19 NSWLR 467 is still the authority on reckless assault in NSW\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRozsa v Samuels [1969] SASR 205\n\nBackground:\n\nThe appellant, a taxi driver, had a confrontation with another taxi driver, Drummond, after cutting in front of him in a taxi queue.\nWhen Drummond threatened physical harm, the appellant responded by showing a table knife, threatening to use it if Drummond tried to attack.\nThe appellant was convicted of assault and appealed the decision.\n\n\nLegal Discussion:\n\nJudge Hogarth examined the nature of assault, specifically focusing on whether a conditional threat (i.e., “I will harm you if you do X”) can constitute an assault.\nThe core issue is whether an apparent threat can still be considered an assault if the threatening individual expresses conditions that may or may not lead to the actual use of force.\n\n\nThe judgment cites several past cases, including “Tuberville v Savage” and “State v Myerfield”.\n\nThese cases suggest that a gesture could be deemed non-assaultive if accompanied by words indicating no intent to use force.\nHowever, a threat coupled with a condition may still constitute an assault, especially if the condition is unlawful or if the threat involves excessive force compared to what would be legally justifiable.\n\n\nJudge Hogarth concluded that the primary test to ascertain if an assault occurred is to determine whether, if Drummond had acted on his threat, the appellant would have been justified in using the table knife in self-defense.\n\nIf the use of the knife would’ve been justifiable, then the conditional threat might not constitute an assault.\n\n\nOutcome:\n\nThe appeal was dismissed, upholding the original conviction of assault.\n\n\n\n\nR v Salisbury [1976] VR 452\n\nThe accused had hit another man in the eye, causing the victim to lose most of the sight of that eye.\n\nHe was convicted of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm: Crimes Act (Vic) s 19A (now repealed).\n\n\nOn appeal it was argued the trial judge had erred in not directing the jury that they were entitled to find the accused guilty of one of the lesser offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm or common assault.\n\nThe accused had not been charged with these offences, thus the question whether the trial judge should have given such a direction could only arise if an assault constituted an essential ingredient of the offence contained in s 19A.]\n\n\nThe injury does not need to have been caused by the accused personally assaulting the complainant.\n\nThis element will be satisfied even if s/he caused the injury indirectly\n\n\n\n\nR v Westaway (1991) 52 A Crim R 336\n\nThe applicant appealed against his conviction under s 16 of the Crimes Act (Vic) for intentionally causing serious injury to a child.\n\nThe applicant had been looking after the 1-month old child of his partner in their caravan, while his partner was out.\n\n\nOn the mother’s return, the child was found to have been injured; she had a fractured skull, brain damage and other injuries.\n\nThe applicant eventually admitted to hitting the child and to picking her up and throwing her.\n\n\nThe injury must have been intended (Westaway v R) AND\n\nThe prosecution must establish an intention to cause serious injury, not merely an intention to do an act which in fact causes serious injury\n\n\n\n\nR v Abdul-Rasool (2008) 18 VR 586\n\nThe applicant was convicted of reckless conduct endangering life.\nIn the course of an altercation in the office of the deputy principal of the school attended by the applicant’s daughter, the applicant poured petrol over herself, some of which splashed onto the deputy principal and an interpreter who was present.\nAt trial, the Crown submitted that in the applicant’s highly agitated state she may have lit the petrol by striking a lighter or matches she was carrying and setting fire to herself.

The Court held that Papadimitropoulos had not committed rape because he had an honest and genuine (though mistaken) belief that the woman had consented to intercourse.\n\n\nSignificance in the context of rape and sexual assault:\n\nThe case is notable for its establishment of the principle that a genuine belief in consent, even if based on a mistake of fact, can serve as a defense to a charge of rape.\nThe decision has been both influential and controversial, as it places an emphasis on the accused’s state of mind and belief about consent rather than the complainant’s actual experience and lack of consent.\n\n\n\n\nSection s 61HE(6) (amended due to this case)\n\nalso clarifies the mens rea for those who commit sexual assault knowing the victim is under a mistaken belief in relation to marriage or to the identity of the accused, or that the act is for a medical or hygienic purpose.\n\n\nIn New South Wales, s 61HE(8)(a) of the Crimes Act provides that a person does not consent to sexual intercourse if that person is substantially intoxicated\n\n\nConditional consent and ‘stealthing’\n\n‘Stealthing’\n\nStealthing involves a person removing their condom during sexual activity, without telling their sexual partner they have done so (and therefore doing so without the partner’s consent).\n\n\nAssange v Swedish Prosecution Authority [2012] EWCA 2849 (Admin)\n\nextradition of Julian Assange to Sweden to face questioning in relation to possible sexual offences\ngave some support to a more expansive approach to the circumstances in which consent is vitiated by mistaken belief or the non-fulfilment of a condition of consent.\n\n\n\n\nAbolition of spousal immunity\n\nCrimes Act (NSW) s 61T\nabolished spousal immunity for sexual axt crimes\n\n\nTHE FAULT ELEMENT OF RAPE\n\nCurrently have fault element, not mens rea for sexaul crimes\nFault element for rape\n\nhaving no reasonable grounds for believing the other person consents (New South Wales)\n\n\n\n\nCommon law subjectivism\n\nDirector of Public Prosecutions v Morgan [1976] AC 182\n\nHouse of Lords Material Facts:\n\nMorgan and 3 friends had been drinking when Morgan invited them to his house andsuggested they have sexual intercourse with his wife.\nMorgan told them she was ‘kinky’ and would pretend to resist but that she really enjoyed this sort of sex.\nAll 3 had intercourse with her, claiming that, although she resisted at first she had later actively co-operated and enjoyed it Victim said she screamed, struggled and shouted for their son to call the police, but the defendants held her down and had sexual intercourse with her.\n\n\nIssue:\n\nWhether in rape a defendant can properly be convicted notwithstanding that he in fact believed the woman consented, if such belief was not based on reasonable grounds?\n\n\nRatio:\n\nPoint in dispute is as to the quality of belief which entitles the defendant to be acquitted and as to the evidential burden of proof with regard to it.\nBelief must be honest.\nReasonableness is only “evidence for or against the view that the belief and therefore the intent was actually held”\n\n\nImportance/Principle:\n\nNSW legislation is in place that allows for the conviction of those who make an honest and yet unreasonable mistake of fact.\nHowever, the case is still important for the strong statement it makes about the relationship between subjective mens rea standards and mistake.\n\nWhere standard is a subjective one, even unreasonable mistakes will negate proof of mens rea, provided they are genuine: Lord Hailsham’s “inexorable logic”\n\n\n\n\nMorgan defence\n\nif an accused genuinely believed that the complainant was consenting to the sexual act, even if that belief was unreasonable, it could be a defense to a charge of rape.\ns 61HK of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) directly addresses the knowledge about consent in sexual assault cases.\n\n\n\n\nLazarus v R [2016] NSWCCA 52\n\nthe defendant appealed against his conviction on a charge of sexual intercourse without consent.\nReally drunk girl on 18th bday accusing dude she met at club\nMay have held an honest belief that the victim consented (a subjective test),\n\nbut that belief was unreasonable (an objective test)\n\nthe accused must have reasonable grounds to believe that the person was consenting\n\n\nDid the accused believe that the person was consenting (subjective)\n\nAND were there reasonable grounds to support that belief?

sexual intercourse with another person without that person’s consent\n\nand they know that the other person does not consent to the sexual intercourse (s 61HE(3)(a))\nor is reckless as to whether the other person consents (s 61HE(3)(b)\n\n\nR v Kitchener (1993) 29 NSWLR 696\n\nThe appellant, who was the president of the Life and Death Motorcycle Club, Penrith Division, took the complainant on a motorcycle ride to a secluded area.\n\nThe complainant alleged that he forcibly performed various sexual acts on her.\n\n\nThe court held that failure to advert at all\tto the possibility that the complainant is not consenting, necessarily means that the accused is reckless as to whether the other\tperson consents.\n\nThis type of behaviour (not even considering the possibility at\tall, despite\tit being obvious) is usually termed inadvertent\trecklessness\n\n\nTranslation: The court held that if an individual does not even consider (or advert to) the possibility that the other party might not be consenting, then this is a form of recklessness.\n\n\nBanditt v R (2005) 224 CLR 262\n\nThe accused was convicted in the New South Wales District Court of breaking and entering a dwelling

reasonable belief, or reasonable grounds for belief, in consent\n\nThe third form of fault element of sexual assault in New South Wales is that the accused ‘has no reasonable grounds for believing’

should the objective test be wholly detached from the accused’s circumstances.\n\nInstead, the court should assess what a “reasonable person” in the position of the accused would have believed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReasonableness and taking steps to find out whether the other person consents\n\nSection 61HE(4)(a) of the Crimes Act (NSW) provides that the trier of fact must have regard to ‘any steps taken by the person to ascertain whether the alleged victim consents to the sexual activity’.\nR v Lazarus [2017] NSWCCA 279 at [146]–[147].\n\n‘steps taken’ requirement\n\nformation of

account when assessing the reasonableness of belief in\n\n\n\n\nMental illness and reasonableness\n\nB v R [2013] EWCA Crim 3.\n\nIn this case, the accused was ‘affected by paranoid schizophrenia and harbouring a number of delusional beliefs’\nthose delusional beliefs were not to be taken into account in assessing the reasonableness of the accused’s belie\n\n\n\n\nThe relevance of awareness of consent-negating circumstances\n\nCrimes Act (NSW) s 61HE(6\n\nrelevant statutes define a number of situations to be cases\nwhere there is no consent to sexual intercourse or penetration:\n\n\nSection 61HE(5) of the Crime Act (NSW) provides\n\nthat consent is vitiated where a person consents to sexual intercourse with another person under a mistaken belief as to the other person’s identity, or a mistaken belief that they are married to the other person, or that the intercourse is for a health or hygienic purpose, or any other mistaken belief about the nature of the act induced by fraud.\n\n\nSubsection (7) then provides that if the other person knows that the person consented while under such a mistaken belief, then they know that the person does not consent.\nThus, subsection (8) defines knowledge of certain kinds of circumstances as also cases of knowledge of non-consent.\nSubsection (9) provides that a person who does not offer actual physical resistance to a sexual activity is not, by reason only of that fact, to be regarded as consenting to the sexual activity\n\n\nJury directions:\n\ns292 - s292E, Criminal Procedure Act 1986\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 7A:

In this case, the mere act of setting the money aside, without further action, did not meet the threshold for criminal intent.\n\nwhere an accused has obtained property due to a mistake, and the accused is aware of the mistake at the time or subsequently becomes aware of the mistake and then converts the property, the accused can be charged with larceny only where the mistake is so fundamental as to prevent ownership from passing.\n\n\nfundamental mistake could not apply to mistakes involving money\n\n\nMistaken identity of the person whom property is given (post office clerk believed M was the person referred to in the letter authorising payment)- Middleton 1873\nThree kinds of fundamental mistakes\n\nMistaken identity of the person whom property is given\n\n(post office clerk believed M was the person referred to in the letter authorising payment)- Middleton 1873\n\n\nMistake as to the identity of the property handed over\n\n(Both A and transferor thought it was a shilling but in fact it was a sovereign)- Ashwell 1885\n\n\nWhere an excess in the quantity of goods is delivered, ownership of the excess has not passed to the receiver - does not apply to money\n\n(8 stacks too many delivered to A who appropriated them, Russell v Smith)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMens rea\n\nThe definition of larceny contained in s 1(1) of the Larceny Act 1916 (UK) requires:\n\n(a) an intent to permanently deprive the owner of their property;\n(b) the absence of a claim of right made in good faith;

her employer and the bank that she was authorized to make the transfers.\n\nEven if MYOB entries were the only deception, they were causative as they concealed misappropriations, allowing further

27–30)\n\n\n\nIt is only when the accused’s activities begin to approach the complete commission of an offence that the law treats the accused as guilty of an attempt.\n\nR v Smith [1975] AC 476\n\nthe House of Lords restated and affirmed the basic distinction between attempts and preparation\nactivity sufficiently indicative of criminal purpose to law-abiding\n\nbefore a person may be guilty of attempting to murder, it must be shown it was their purpose to kill, not merely to cause some harm which, if the victim had died, would have made the accused a murderer in the eyes of the law\n\n\n\n\n344A Attempts\n\n(1) Subject to this Act, any person who attempts to commit any offence for which a penalty is provided under this Act shall be liable to that penalty.\n(2) Where a person is convicted of an attempt to commit an offence and the offence concerned is a serious indictable offence the person shall be deemed to have been convicted of a serious indictable offence\n\n\nR v Mohan [1976] QB 1\n\nD drove his car quickly when a policeman ordered him to stop.\n\nThe car almost hit the policeman and D was charged with attempted ABH against the policeman.\nThe judge directed that D had to have been at least reckless that ABH would be caused.\nCA allowed appeal against D’s conviction since in attempted crimes it had to be proved that D intended the crime regardless of normal rules of mens rea.\nHowever, in relation to the offence of attempt, such knowledge is not to be equated with intent unless it is established.\n\n\nThe term “intention” refers to the decision, to ensure that a specific outcome is achieved.\n\nIt is thus irrelevant whether the intended result was likely to occur or not.\n\n\nTo prove the offence of attempt to commit a crime, a specific intent has to be proven i.e., an aim or decision by the accused to bring about the commission of the offence that he was alleged to have attempted to commit.\n\nIt was not enough to show that the accused knew or foresaw that the ramifications of his actions would almost certainly result in the commission of the actual offence; nor is a reckless state of mind sufficient to demonstrate the required mens rea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR v Eagleton (1855) Dears CC 515\n\nEagleton contracted with a local Poor Law authority to supply bread of an agreed weight to poor persons who presented the

activity constituted an attempt\n\n\n\n\njury found that Eagleton intended to represent that the loaves were of full weight\nEagleton test?\n\nActs remotely leading to the commission of the offence

scaling fence to break into house.\n\nStill guilty.\n\n\nAttempt is an act done or omitted with intent to commit that offence, forming part of a series of acts, which would have constituted the offence if the D completed the offence.\n\nAttempt is “an act done or omitted with intent to commit that offence, forming part of a seriesof acts or omissions which would have constituted the offence if such series of acts or omissions had not been interrupted either by the voluntary determination of the offender not to complete the offence or by some other cause”\n\n\n\n\n\nDirector of Public Prosecutions v Stonehouse [1978] AC 55\n\nknown as the substantial progress or sufficiently proximate test.\nFakes death to claim insurance money.\nHere, the charge was that the accused “dishonestly and by deception enabled his wife toobtain insurance money by the false pretence that he had drowned.”\n\nTowards the commissionof that offence “the faking of his death was\n\n(a) intended to produce that result;\n(b) was thefinal act that he could perform, and\n(c) went a substantial distance towards the attainment of his goal.\n\n\nActs which are “sufficiently proximate” to completed offence, and not merely in preparation\n\n\nIn short, in my judgment it was sufficiently proximate thereto to constitute theattempt charged.”\n\nFound guilty\n\n\n\n\n\n\nATTEMPTS AND SEXUAL ASSAULT\n\nEvans v R (1987) 48 SASR 35\n\nAttempted sexual assault includes reckless indifference as to whether V consents.\ntrial judge in directing the jury as to the law relating to attempted rape, referred to the mental element in the same terms as the mental element of rape,\n\nthat is to say, knowledge that the woman was not consenting or reckless indifference as to whether she was consenting or not\n\n\nThis submission raises the question of the mental element of a crime of attempt.\n\nAn attempt is necessarily purposive.\nA person attempts to do something only if he intends to do that thing.\n\n\n\n\nIMPOSSIBILITY\n\nCan a person be guilty of attempting to commit an offence where, for one reason or another, it was not possible for that person to commit the full offence itself\nR v Smith [1975] AC 476\n\nLater held incorrect\n\n\nLegal impossibility\n\nLegal impossibility covers two types of case.\n\nFirst, the accused may believe their objective to be criminal when in fact it is not.\n\nadultery\n\n\nThe second type of legal impossibility involves accused persons who are outside the class of those defined by the law as capable of committing particular crimes.\n\n14 and younger could not be convicted of rape\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFactual impossibility\n\nAll other types of impossibility are classified as cases of ‘factual impossibility’.\nThe accused fires a gun into an empty room, intending to kill a person believed to be in the room.\n\nThe intended victim is, in fact, nowhere in the vicinity.\nThis was held to constitute an attempt in the American case of State v Mitchell (1902) 170 Mo 633.\n\n\n\n\nThe principle in R v Smith\n\nR v Smith [1975] AC 476,\n\nthe police stopped an overloaded van on the highway.\nThe van was found to contain stolen corned beef, whereupon the van and its driver were taken to a police station.\n\nAfter a period, the police allowed the van to proceed to its destination in order to trap a number of persons who were destined to receive the goods\n\n\nLord Hailsham concluded that the facts of R v Smith likely fell within class 6 but at the very least within class\nR v Donnelly [1970] NZLR 980 sixfold classification\n\n(1) The accused may change her or his mind before committing any act sufficiently overt to amount to an attempt.\n\nClearly, there would be no criminal attempt in this situation.\n\n\n(2) The accused may change her or his mind, but too late to deny that she or he had got so far as an attempt.\n\nIn this situation, there would be a criminal attempt.\n\n\n(3) The accused may be prevented by some outside agency from doing some act necessary to complete the commission of the crime.\n\nFor example, a police officer may interrupt the accused while he or she is endeavouring to force a window open, but before an actual breaking occurs.\nIn this situation, there would be a criminal attempt assuming sufficiently proximate overt acts had occurred.\n\n\n(4) The accused may suffer no such outside interference but may fail to complete the crime because of incompetence.\n\nFor example, the accused may shoot at an intended victim who is out of range or administer a dose of poison to the intended victim that is insufficiently potent to kill.\nCases such as these constitute criminal attempts.\n\n\n(5) The accused may find that what he or she is proposing to do is after all impossible in a physical sense — it does not fail as a result of any incompetence on the accused’s part.\n\nThe empty pocket case would be an example of this.\nLord Hailsham reviewed the authorities, which were in conflict, and concluded that cases falling within this fifth class did not constitute criminal attempts.\n\n\n(6) The accused may do every act he or she sets out to do but it may transpire that those acts, contrary to the accused’s own belief at the time, do not, after all, amount in law to a crime.\n\nFor example, the accused may believe that duty is payable on a particular commodity and smuggle it past customs officers when, in fact, no duty is payable on that item.\nIn this situation, the accused would not be guilty of attempted smuggling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto fire a shot at a person just out of range is a case of relative impossibility (class 4),\n\nwhile to fire a shot into an empty room, the intended victim being many miles away at the time, is a case of absolute impossibility (class 5)\nThe accused’s moral culpability is precisely the same in cases of absolute impossibility as in cases of relative impossibility\n\n\n\n\nR v Smith does not represent Australian common\n\nR v Mai (1992) 26 NSWLR 371\nrejected earlier New South Wales decisions that followed R v Smith in favour of following the Victorian approach in Britten v Alpogut.\nR v Collingridge (1976) 16 SASR 117\nWhile his wife was bathing, the accused entered the bathroom and threw the bared end of a live electric wire into the water behind her.\n\nThe wire did not touch her body and he did not attempt to bring it into contact with her body.\nIf, however, the wire had contacted her body she might have been killed.\n\n\nIssue was whether the case was one of relative impossibility (because the current was insufficient on the facts) or absolute impossibility (because it was absolutely impossible that an electric wire placed as it was could have led to the victim’s death).\n\n\nBritten v Alpogut [1987]

After making a report and getting no response, they drugged, killed and dug the husband up.\nThe son was acquitted on self-defence but Osland was found guilty.\n\nThe outcome should have been different as the absence of response from the police gave Osland and her son no choice but to act in self-defence.\nInstead of being charged for murder, she should have been acquitted on self-defence, just as her son did, or at least received a much lighter sentence.\n\n\n\n\nHuynh v R; Duong v R; Sem v R (2013) 295 ALR 624;\n\nFacts\n\nV was stabbed and killed, conflicting stories about who did what and weapons\nUnclear who stabbed, all denied to inflict death/ grievous bodily harm or agreement\n\n\nHeld\n\nIf agreement to inflict death or grievous harm and Ds were present – sufficient to make them liable as principal offenders (don’t need 323 or 324 but could as an alternative)\nA person participates in joint criminal enterprise by being present when crime is committed pursuant to an agreement\nProof D assaulted person was material to determination of existence and nature of any agreement to which D was a party\n\n\n\n\nLikiardopoulos v The Queen (2012) 247 CLR 265,\n\nthe court dealt with the question of whether being a mere presence at the scene of a crime could constitute aiding and abetting. The court suggested that mere presence is generally insufficient to establish liability unless it’s accompanied by other factors like encouragement or direct participation in the crime.\n\n\nProchilo\n\n\nWithdrawal\n\nWhite v Ridley (1978) 140 CLR 34\n\nHigh Court emphasised the need for ‘timely communication’ of the intention to withdraw, and taking reasonable steps to prevent the commission of the crime\nrules of timely withdrawal also apply in cases of joint criminal enterprise\n\n\nR v Tietie, Tulele and Bolamatu (1988) 34 A Crim R 438,\n\nendorsed the following trial judge’s direction to a jury in a case where the appellant alleged that he had withdrawn from a joint criminal enterprise before it escalated into a more violent, and ultimately fatal, attack on the victim\n\nThe Crown must negate timely withdrawal beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\n\n\nMcEwan, Robb and Dambitis v R (2013) 41 VR 330\n\nconsidered the issue of withdrawal from a joint criminal\n\na participant would not escape liability merely by leaving the scene shortly before the offence was committed, or by attempting to withdraw when it was too late to stop the offence\nOnly wait to do so is if participant attempts to discourage group from continuing crime\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINCIPAL IN THE FIRST DEGREE: DOCTRINE OF INNOCENT AGENCY\n\nA person who acts through an innocent agent is a principal in the first degree rather than an abettor.\nThe innocent agent may be either one who is unaware of what they are doing (as in the case of a person who administers poison, believing it to be harmless) or one who is (in a sense) aware of what they are doing but, for some reason, is not amenable to the criminal law.\nThis could arise in various ways; for example, the agent might be insane or might be excused on some ground such as duress or infancy.\n\nSee Pinkstone v R (2004) 219 CLR 444; 206 ALR 84; Matusevich (at 12.52C ).\n\n\n\n\n\nR v Hewitt [1997] 1 VR 301\n\nFACTS:\n\nA lured V into vehicle – picked co-accused up\talong\tthe way – not in presence of\tCA, A insisted V have sex with Co-accused (CA) – no AR from A – innocent agency – A set up situation\t– forced V sex with CA\nThe jury acquitted the co-accused\ton all\tcounts but found the accused guilty of rape on each count.\n\n\nHELD:\n\nDoctrine of\tIA should be considered separate\tfrom accessorial\tliability\nWhat\thas to be demonstrated in order to\tsupport conviction on this basis (per Cogan and\tLeak) is that A wanted and intended the act of intercourse by ‘the agent’ to take place and, by his conduct, caused the\tact to occur when he knew that the V was not consenting.\nP was “merely the instrument used” (so CAs\tAR was attributed to A)\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 9: Complicity, and Extended Joint Criminal Enterprise\n\nACCESSORIAL LIABILITY\n\nAccessorial liability\n\nss 345, 346 and 351\nwhere D does not commit the actus reus of the principal offence, but where D intends to assist the P1 in some way or other in the commission of the offenc\nAbettors (including accessories before the fact) are liable to be punished in the same way as principals in the first degree: Crimes Act (NSW) ss 345–346, 351.\n\naccessories after the fact are commonly liable to lesser penalties than the principal offender: Crimes Act (NSW) ss 348–350\n\n\nan abettor can be guilty of a higher crime than the principal in the first degree\n\nR v Howe [1987] 1 All ER 771;

Ruddock [2017] AC 387\n\nFacts\n\nThis joint case involved two separate appellants who had been convicted for murder on the basis of joint enterprise, after a co-defendant had actually killed the victim.\nIn the case of Jogee, he had been vocally encouraging the principal while he murdered a police officer.\n\nIn Jogee, the judge made the direction that liability as an accessory would attach where the defendant participated in the attack while realising that the principal might stab the victim while intending to cause really serious harm.\n\n\nIn the case of Ruddock, liability was based on his participation in a botched robbery during which the principal murdered the victim (an act which the principal admitted).\n\nIn the case of Ruddock, the judge made the direction that it was necessary to establish a shared common intention between the principal and the accessory and this could be proved where the defendant was shown to have known that there was a real possibility that the principal might intend to commit a given crime (in that case GBH or murder) and still continued with his participation in the joint enterprise.\n\n\n\n\nIssues\n\nThe court had to determine whether the principle of Parasitic Accessory Liability, as established in Chan Wing-Siu v The Queen [1985] 1 AC 168, is a correct exposition of the law.\n\n\nDecision/Outcome\n\nThe court held that in order to prove accessorial liability, it was not sufficient to only prove the necessary mental element, but also the element of conduct.\n\nThis could be discharged by proving that the accessory either assisted or at least encouraged the principal in committing the offence.\n\n\nThe mental element is discharged by proving that the accessory intended to so assist or encourage the principal.\n\nThe mental element however is not discharged by mere foresight that the principal might commit an offence.\n\n\nChan Wing-Siu v The Queen [1985] 1 AC 168 was incorrectly decided in the part of equating foresight with intent.\nThe convictions were therefore quashed and R v Collinson (1831) 4 Car &amp; P 556, R v Smith (Wesley) [1963] 1 WLR 1200, CCA and R v Reid (Barry) (1976) 62 Cr App R 109, CA were approved.\n\n\n\n\n\nABANDONMENT OF CRIMINAL PARTICIPATION\n\nR v Rook [1993] 2 All ER 955\n\nFacts\n\nThe accused agreed with A, L and MA to kill MA’s wife in return for MA paying them £20,000\nAccused seemingly bailed, but the others killed wife anyways.\n\n\nDefense\n\nThe accused’s defence was that he had never intended the woman to be killed, that he hoped to get some money ‘up front’ from MA and then disappear, that he had never intended to go through with the killing himself and that he had deliberately absented himself on the day of the killing because he thought that if he were not there the other two would not go ahead with the crime\n\n\nHeld\n\nwhile a person who has embarked on a criminal enterprise may withdraw from it and save himself from criminal liability, ‘more than mere inactivity is required to destroy the criminal liability which flows from the earlier acts\nConvicted, appeal dismissed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACCESSORIES AFTER THE FACT\n\nBlackstone’s description of an accessory after the fact is ‘where a person, knowing a felony to have been committed, receives, relieves, comforts, or assists the felon’: 4 B1 Comm\nAt common law, an accused can only be convicted as an accessory after the fact if it is established that they had knowledge of all the relevant facts or acts that established the precise offence with respect to which the Crown alleged the accused was an accessory: R v Stone [1981] VR 737\nThe penalty for an accessory after the fact for treason is 2 years;

Automatism\n\nThe foundations of the modern law on insanity are to be found, however, in two nineteenth century cases.\n\nThe first is the Trial of James Hadfield (1800) 27 St Tr 1282.\n\nFacts\n\nHadfield attempted to kill King George III by shooting at him\nAt his trial it appeared that Hadfield had acted under a delusion, possibly brought on by an injury to the brain sustained while a soldier, that he was to be the saviour of the world and that this was to be accomplished by his being executed after commission of a spectacular crime.\n\n\nUncertainty about whether it was possible to detain Hadfield under the criminal law prompted Parliament to pass the Criminal Lunatics Act 1800 (39 &amp; 40 Geo 3 c 94) (England and Wales\n\nIt provided that in cases where it appeared at a trial that the accused was insane and they were acquitted on this ground, the accused should not be released but should be ordered to be detained at the pleasure of the Sovereign.\nThe provision in the 1800 Act that a defendant found ‘not guilty on account of insanity’ would be detained ‘in strict custody … until His Majesty’s pleasure be known’ came to be known as indefinite detention, and carried over from England and Wales to the Australian states and territories\n\n\n\n\nThe second, Re M’Naghten’s Case (1843) 10 Cl &amp; Fin 20\n\nDaniel McNaughtan shot and killed Edward Drummond, who was secretary to Sir Robert Peel, the then Prime Minister of England.\nMcNaughtan had suffered from the delusion that he was being followed and persecuted by his enemies.\n\nHe also believed that these persecutors were ‘the Tories’, and he made several unsuccessful attempts to air his grievances, but without result.\nAt his trial, various lay witnesses testified to his delusions and five eminent doctors also gave evidence in support of the view that he was insane.\nTindal CJ, in effect, stopped the trial by advising the jury that they could, if they wished, return a verdict of not guilty without hearing further evidence.\n\n\nPost trial parliament hearing about case came to be known as The M’Naghten Rules\n\nIt is well recognised that the M’Naughten Rules-influenced insanity defence is difficult to raise successfully.\n\n\n\n\nA defence related to the defence of mental impairment is that of automatism.\n\nAutism def\n\nAutomatism may be described variously as insane automatism, where the accused acts under the influence of an internal or congenital physiological condition or illness, including a mental illness, or non-insane automatism, where the accused acts in response to an external stimulus.\n\n\nAlthough automatism is colloquially referred to as a defence, it is probably more appropriate to think of it as a negativing factor.\n\nautomatism merely restates the requirement that the the act of the accused must be voluntary – ‘conscious’ or ‘willed’ (Ryan)\n\n\nInsane automatism is dealt with under the defence of mental illness/impairment.\nAs such, most cases of automatism arise from the accused’s reaction to an ‘external’, rather than an ‘internal’, factor\n\nIt is on this basis that non-insane automatism is thought to mark out an individual who is of less danger to the community, resulting in an unqualified verdict of acquittal.\n\n\nWhere an accused consumes an intoxicant voluntarily they will be dealt with under the law of intoxication, even regarding automatism.\n\nA plea of automatism is preserved where an accused loses consciousness or ‘blacks out’ as the result of the involuntary consumption of an intoxicant: see s 428G.\n\n\n\n\nAn additional defence dependent on the accused’s mental state is the defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind\nunfitness to plead def.\n\nIt is a procedural provision (rather than a defence) that exempts an accused from an ordinary trial (at least temporarily) on the basis that they cannot understand or participate in it\nIf a defendant is found unfit to plead, they are also subject to the disposal regime that follows a successful mental impairment defence: see Kesavarajah v R (1994) 181 CLR 230;\n\nA person who is unfit to plead may have been of sound mind at the time of the alleged offending, and a person who suffered an exculpatory mental impairment at the time of the otherwise criminal conduct may be fit to plead at the time of the trial.\nIf an accused satisfies both conditions, then it will usually be the case that they will argue unfitness to plead fi\n\n\n\n\nRe M’Naghten’s Case (1843) 10 Cl &amp; Fin 200\n\nFacts\n\nIn January 1843, at the parish of Saint Martin, Middlesex, Daniel M’Naghten took a pistol and shot Edward Drummond, who he believed to the British Prime Minister Robert Pell, wounding him fatally.\n\nDrummond died five days later and M’Naghten was charged with his murder. He pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity.\n\n\nAt trial, evidence was given of the shooting of Drummond and witnesses were called on the behalf of the defendant, M’Naghten, to attest to the fact he was not in a sound state of mind at the time of committing the act.\n\nSome of the witnesses who gave this evidence, had previously examined M’Naghten, whilst others had not seen him prior to the trial and, and they formed their opinion on hearing the evidence given by other witnesses.\nThe medical evidence brought forward stated that persons of otherwise sound mind, might be affected by morbid delusions and that M’Naghten was so affected.\n\n\nA person labouring under such delusion, might usually possess a moral perception of right and wrong, but in relation to acts connected to their delusion may be carried beyond power of their own control leaving them with no such perception.\nAccordingly M’Naghten was not capable of exercising control over his acts whilst under his delusion. Due to the nature of M’Naghten’s condition these delusions went on gradually until they reached a climax, ending with Drummond being shot.\n\nEvidence brought before the Court about the condition from which M’Naghten suffered stated that a man may go on for years quietly whilst under the delusion’s influence, but had the potential break out into extravagant and violent paroxysms.\n\n\nIn relation to the charge against M’Naghten, Lord Chief Justice Tindal stated that “the question to be determined is, whether at the time the act in question was committed, the prisoner had or had not the use of his understanding, so as to know that he was doing a wrong or wicked act.\n\nIf the jurors should be of opinion that the prisoner was not sensible, at the time he committed it, that he was violating the laws both of God and man, then he would be entitled to a verdict in his favour:\n\nbut if, on the contrary, they were of opinion that when he committed the act he was in a sound state of mind, then their verdict must be against him.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM’Naghten was found not guilty.\n\nFollowing this a panel of Judges attended the House of Lords and had a series of hypothetical questions on the topic of insanity put before them.\n\n\nIssues\n\nThe hypothetical questions about insanity the judges had to address were as follows:\n\nWhat is the law respecting alleged crimes committed by persons afflicted with insane delusion, in respect of one or more particular subjects or persons: as, for instance, where at the time of the commission of the alleged crime, the accused knew he was acting contrary to law, but did the act complained of with a view, under the influence of insane delusion, of redressing or revenging some supposed grievance or injury, or of producing some supposed public benefit?\nWhat are the proper questions to be submitted to the jury, when a person alleged to be afflicted with insane delusion respecting one or more particular subjects or persons, is charged with the commission of a crime (murder, for example), and insanity is set up as a defence?\nIn what terms ought the question to be left to the jury, as to the prisoner’s state of mind at the time when the act was committed?\nIf a person under an insane delusion as to existing facts, commits an offence in consequence thereof, is he thereby excused?\nCan a medical man conversant with the disease of insanity, who never saw the prisoner previously to the trial, but who was present during the whole trial and the examination of all the witnesses, be asked his opinion as to the state of the prisoner’s mind at the time of the commission of the alleged crime, or his opinion whether the prisoner was conscious at the time of doing the act, that he was acting contrary to law, or whether he was labouring under any and what delusion at the time?\n\n\n\n\nDecision/Outcome\n\nIn response to these questions the Judges formulated the M’Naghten Rules (1843) 4 St.Tr.(N.S.) 847.\nThese provide the legal definition of insanity. Insanity def:\nThey provide that a defendant wishing to rely on the defence of insanity must show that:\n\nThey laboured under a defect of reason\nCaused by a disease of the mind; so that either\nHe did not know the nature and quality of his acts, or that he did not know what he was doing was wron\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR v Porter (1933) 55 CLR 182\n\nBackground facts\n\nThe Defendant [Porter] became estranged from his wife and extremely emotional because of it.\nEvidence suggests he had a nervous breakdown, barely slept, and took a lot of aspirin and caffeine.\nAfter a final unsuccessful attempt to reconcile with his wife, he decided to commit suicide and kill his infant child as well.\nHe injected his son with poison, but the police came in beforehe had a chance to kill himself.\nHe was charged for the murder of his son, and he pleaded that he was mentally insane at the time.\n\n\nLegal issues\n\nInsanity Defence - Clarifying terms from M’Naghten’s Case\n\n\nJudgement\n\nEvery person is presumed to be sane unless he argues otherwise (prosecution doesn’t need to disprove it until it is raised).\n\nWhen assessing insanity, it is important to only assess whether the accused was insane at the time the act was committed, as opposed to before, after, or now.\n\n\nA ‘disease of the mind’ is defined as much more than mere excitability, stupidness, passion, lack of self control etc.\n\nThose are the actions of the normal man, and a ‘disease of the mind’ requires a real disorder.\n\n\n‘Did not know the nature and quality of their act’ means that the accused did not understand what they were doing, and what the implications would be (ie, ending a life).\n\nThis is a very high standard.\nThe person must be so clueless that, in his mind, ending a life would be the same as breaking a twig.\n\n\n‘Did not know what they were doing was wrong’ means that the accused was not capable of reasoning that his act is wrong is the normal standards of everyday life.\n\nThis is a lower standard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWillgoss v R (1960) 105 CLR 295\n\nMurder during robbery, D psychopath. Distinguished psychopath by gross lack of self-control and gross lack or diminution of emotional feeling, which involved gross diminution of conscience.\n\nArgued judge didn’t distinguish an intellectual understanding of wrongfulness and an emotional appreciation of it.\nRequest denied.\n\nThe complaint, however, on behalf of the prisoner is that his Honour did not direct the jury that a mere intellectual apprehension on the prisoner’s part of the wrongness of the act would not or might not amount to knowledge unless it was accompanied by some sufficient appreciation of, or feeling about, the effect of his act upon other people; perhaps some moral appreciation.\nThe law provides no foundation for such a complaint.\n\nIt is enough to say that it is an attempt to refine upon what amounts to knowledge of the wrongness of the act which is not countenanced by the law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney-General (South Australia) v Brown [1960] AC 432\n\nBackground:\n\nAccused charged with murder, sole defense being insanity.\nHigh Court of Australia quashed initial guilty verdict.\n\n\nLegal Issue:\n\nCan “uncontrollable impulse” serve as evidence of legal insanity without specific medical backing?\n\n\nMedical Evidence:\n\nDefense and prosecution agreed on schizoid personality disorder but disagreed on accused’s mental state during the crime.\n\n\nRatio:\n\nPrivy Council emphasized M’Naughten Rules as defining legal insanity. “Uncontrollable impulse” not recognized as a symptom of legal insanity by default.\n\n\nDecision:\n\nPrivy Council allowed the Crown’s appeal, setting aside the High Court’s judgment.\n\n\nApplication:\n\nOriginal guilty verdict upheld; clarified role of “uncontrollable impulse” in insanity defense.\n\n\n\n\nR v Falconer (1990) 171 CLR 30;\n\nProsecution will presume this act was voluntary unless there is evidence to the contrary\n\nIf automatic, not liable\n\n\nDid not to the actus Reus because they were unwilled or unconscious- involuntary\n\nThis is caused by trauma, that the ordinary person is not likely to withstand.\nTransient, and due to some external cause the ordinary person would not likely withstand, not prone to recur\nEXAMPLES: Disassociation, concussion, sleepwalking, Acts performed under\tanesthetic,\t Hypoglycemia\n\n\nBackground:\n\nThe defendant, Falconer, was charged with murdering her husband.\nShe claimed to have no memory of the act and argued that she was suffering from dissociation at the time, making her actions involuntary.\n\n\nLegal Issue:\n\nThe primary issue was whether acts committed during a dissociative state could be considered “involuntary,” thus negating the actus reus element required for criminal liability.\n\n\nCourt’s Reasoning:\n\nThe High Court of Australia examined the concept of “voluntariness” in criminal law.\nIt was established that the prosecution generally presumes an act is voluntary unless there is evidence to the contrary.\n\n\nFactors for Involuntariness:\n\nThe court highlighted that an act could be considered involuntary if it was automatic or unconscious.\n\nThe condition causing this must be transient, due to some external cause an ordinary person would not likely withstand, and not prone to recur.\n\n\n\n\nExamples:\n\nThe court discussed various states or conditions that could render an act involuntary, such as dissociation, concussion, sleepwalking, acts performed under anesthesia, and hypoglycemia.\n\n\nDecision:\n\nThe High Court upheld Falconer’s conviction, finding that her act was not involuntary under the law.\n\n\nSignificance:\n\nThe case is significant for its comprehensive discussion on what constitutes an “involuntary” act in criminal law, establishing guidelines for what could negate criminal liability.\nThe High Court of Australia outlined three tests to distinguish between non-insane (sane) and insane automatism:\n\nNature of Condition:\n\nInsane automatism is generally associated with a disease of the mind or mental disorder, whereas sane automatism typically results from a transient condition like concussion, sleepwalking, or shock.\n\n\nLikelihood of Recurrence:\n\nThe Court pointed out that for it to be considered insane automatism, the condition should be prone to recur.\nConversely, sane automatism is generally due to an external cause unlikely to recur.\n\n\nOrdinary Person Test:\n\nThe condition causing the automatistic state in sane automatism is usually something that an ordinary person would not likely withstand, like extreme trauma.\nInsane automatism, on the other hand, typically does not pass this “ordinary person” test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf an accused raises both mental impairment and automatism, different directions regarding burdens will be required.\n\nunlike mental impairment, the defence need only raise evidence of automatism, rather than prove it to a legal standard.\n\nThus, if sufficient evidence of automatism is raised by the defence, the prosecution bears the burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was not acting in an automatistic state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion of Law Reserved (No 1 of 1997) (1997) 70 SASR 251\n\nBackground:\n\nThe case involved a person charged with murder who had a history of psychiatric illness.\nThe case stated raised questions about the accused’s mental competence to commit the offense and issues of self-defense.\nThe case was reserved for the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia.\n\n\nLegal Issue:\n\nThe main legal issue revolved around changes to the Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA), which established a code for dealing with issues of mental competence to commit an offense and fitness to stand trial.\n\n\nCourt’s Reasoning:\n\nJustice Duggan provided an in-depth interpretation of Section 269B and related provisions of the Act.\nThese sections significantly depart from the common law by separating issues of mental competence from the rest of the trial.\nThe Court also clarified what counts as “objective” and “subjective” elements of an offense.\n\n\nProcedural Steps:\n\nAccording to the Act, if the court is satisfied that the accused was mentally incompetent to commit the offense, it must record a finding to that effect.\nDepending on the evidence, the court may then either discharge the accused or find them not guilty but liable for supervision.\n\n\nSubjective vs Objective Elements:\n\nThe Act distinguishes between subjective elements (mental states like intention, knowledge, etc.) and objective elements (all other elements of the offense).\nA finding of mental incompetence, coupled with proof of objective elements beyond reasonable doubt, results in a verdict of not guilty but liable for supervision.\n\n\nImpact on Defenses like Self-Defense:\n\nThe Court noted that defenses such as self-defense are not considered objective elements under the Act.\nThe state of mind that would attract self-defense is a subjective element of the offense for the purposes of Part 8A of the Act.\n\n\nLegislative Intent:\n\nThe Court observed that the legislation aims to address issues previously encountered in common law, particularly concerning voluntariness and other subjective elements.\nThe legislation assumes that any lack of voluntariness is likely due to mental incompetence.\n\n\nSignificance:\n\nThe case is significant for its interpretation of the Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA), particularly in dealing with defendants who have a history of psychiatric illness.\nIt clarifies how issues of mental competence and self-defense should be treated under this legislative framework.\n\n\nDecision:\n\nJustices Matheson and Nyland concurred with Justice Duggan’s reasoning and interpretation of the Act.\n\n\n\n\nSOME COMMENTS ON MENTAL IMPAIRMENT AND RELATED DEFENCES\n\nScope of the mental impairment defence\n\nThe scope of the M’Naghten Rules has been restricted to cognitive defects (defects of reason or rationality), excluding defects of conation, the psychological processes of desire and volition.\n\nThus, the rules do not extend to cover the case of psychopathy (Willgoss v R (at 15.14C)) and are not readily applicable to the person who is aware of the nature and wrongfulness of the acts they are performing but who is unable to restrain themself from so acting, that is, the person suffering from uncontrollable impulse:\n\nAttorney-General (South Australia) v Brown (at 15.15C ).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommonwealth’s Criminal Code (Schedule to the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth)) widens the common law defence of insanity.\n\nSection 7.3(1) of the Code provides:\n\n(1) A person is not criminally responsible for an offence if, at the time of carrying out the conduct constituting the offence, the person was suffering from a mental impairment that had the effect that:\n\n(a) the person did not know the nature and quality of the conduct; or\n(b) the person did not know that the conduct was wrong (that is, the person could not reason with a moderate degree of sense and composure about whether the conduct, as perceived by reasonable people, was wrong); or\n(c) the person was unable to control the conduct.\n\n\n\n\n‘Mental impairment’ is defined in s 7.3(8) and (9) as follows:\n\n(8) In this Code:\n\nmental impairment includes senility, intellectual disability, mental illness, brain damage and severe personality disorder.\n\n\n(9) The reference in subsection (8) to mental illness is a reference to an underlying pathological infirmity of the mind, whether of long or short duration and whether permanent or temporary, but does not include a condition that results from the reaction of a healthy mind to extraordinary external stimuli.\n\nHowever, such a condition may be evidence of a mental illness if it involves some abnormality and is prone to recur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn New South Wales, the defence of mental impairment continues to be governed by the common law M’Naghten Rules, but a procedural framework for the defence was included in the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW).\n\nSection 38(1) provides that if the person tried ‘did the act or made the omission charged, but was mentally ill at the time’, the jury should return a ‘special verdict’ — ‘that the accused person is not guilty by reason of mental illness’.\nMental illness def\n\nthe Mental Health Act 2007 (NSW) s 4 provides:\n\nmental illness means a condition that seriously impairs, either temporarily or permanently, the mental functioning of a person and is characterised by the presence in the person of any one or more of the following symptoms—\n\n(a) delusions,\n(b) hallucinations\n(c) serious disorder of thought form,\n(d) a severe disturbance of mood,\n(e) sustained or repeated irrational behaviour indicating the presence of any one or more of the symptoms referred to in paragraphs (a)–(d).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvolitional incapacity has been proposed\n\nVolitional incapacity def\n\nthe person was unable to control the conduct’\n\n\nThe revised defence would rest on statutory definitions of ‘mental health impairment’ and ‘cognitive impairmen\n\n‘Mental health impairment def’ is defined broadly as a ‘temporary or continuing disturbance of thought, mood, volition, perception, or memory that impairs emotional wellbeing, judgment or behaviour, so as to affect functioning in daily life to a material extent’\n\n\n\n\nCognitive impairment def:\n\n(a) Cognitive impairment is an ongoing impairment in comprehension, reason, adaptive functioning, judgement, learning or memory that is the result of any damage to, dysfunction, developmental delay, or deterioration of the brain or mind.\n(b) Such cognitive impairment may arise from, but is not limited to, the following:\n\n(i) intellectual disability\n(ii) borderline intellectual functioning\n(iii) dementias\n(iv) acquired brain injury\n(v) drug or alcohol related brain damage\n(vi) autism spectrum disorders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Mental Health and Cognitive Impairment Forensic Provisions Bill 2020 (NSW) seeks to replace the previous defence of not guilty by reason of mental illness with a verdict of ‘act proven but not criminally responsible’.\n\nThe Bill proposes that a jury is to return a special verdict of act proven but not criminally responsible in respect of an offence if the jury is satisfied that the defence of mental health impairment or cognitive impairment has been established.\n\n\nThe question of whether the defence is established is to be determined on the balance of probabilities by the jury (or judge where there is no jury)\n\n\nThe burden of proof\n\nIn M’Naghten’s Case, the legal burden of proof on the issue of insanity was clearly placed on the accuse\n\nthe jurors ought to be told in all cases that every man is to be presumed to be sane, and to possess a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his crimes, until the contrary be proved to their satisfaction’\nThe standard of proof is on the balance of probabilities.\n\nInsanity is the only common law defence that imposes a legal (as opposed to evidentiary) burden on the accused, and it is referred to as the ‘reverse burden of proof ’ on that basis\n\n\n\n\nIn Woolmington v DPP [1935] AC 462, the House of Lords accepted insanity as an exception to the ‘golden thread’, and this view has been accepted in numerous Australian cases:\n\nIt has also been held that the burden of proof on substantial impairment by abnormality of mind and unfitness to plead, rests on the accused: R v Dunbar [1958] 1 QB 1;\n\n\n\n\nDisposition of mentally ill offenders\n\nThe underlying rationale of current disposition rules is that an individual found not guilty by reason of mental illness should be subject to a regime that is the least restrictive of their freedom and autonomy as is consistent with the safety of the community.\ns 39 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 provides that on a finding of not guilty by reason of mental illness, the court may order that the person be detained in such place and in such manner as the court thinks fit until released by due process of law, or may make such other order (including an order releasing the person from custody, either unconditionally or subject to conditions) as the court considers appropriate.\n\ns 39(2) provides that the court is not to make an order under this section for the release of a person from custody unless it is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the safety of the person or any member of the public will not be seriously endangered by the person’s release.\n\n\n\n\nVictim rights following the special hearing\n\nIn 2018, New South Wales introduced the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Amendment (Victims) Act 2018 (NSW), which gave victims of crime the ability to furnish an impact statement before a judge conducting a special hearing into the standing of mentally ill offenders.\nThe 2018 amending legislation amends the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) by inserting s 28A, which provides the following rights to victims and their families:\n\n28A Victim impact statements where verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness or limited finding of guilt\n\n(1) A court may receive a victim impact statement after:\n\n(a) a verdict that an accused person is not guilty by reason of mental illness (whether or not following a special hearing) under the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, or\n(b) a verdict following a special hearing under that Act, that, on the limited evidence available, an accused person committed an offence.\n\n\n(2) A court must acknowledge receipt of the victim impact statement.\n(3) A court may consider a victim impact statement when it considers what conditions are to be imposed on the release of the accused person.\n(4) A court is not to consider a victim impact statement when determining the limiting term to be imposed on an accused person.\n(5) A court must not consider a victim impact statement under this section unless it has been given by or on behalf of the victim to whom it relates or by or on behalf of the prosecutor.\n\n\n28B Submissions by designated carers and principal care providers\n\n(1) A court may seek a submission by the designated carer or principal care provider of an accused person after a verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness (whether or not following a special hearing) under the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 or a verdict following a special hearing under that Act, that, on the limited evidence available, the accused person committed an offence.\nAt the time of publication, these amendments had not yet commenced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR v DB [2022] NSWCCA 87:\nBackground:\n\nThe case revolves around an individual (referred to as DB) who was accused of child sexual offending.\nThe defense for DB was centered around a condition known as sexsomnia, which is a form of parasomnia where an individual engages in sexual activities while asleep​.\n\n\nLegal Issue:\n\nThe core legal issue was whether sexsomnia could be considered a mental health impairment under the Mental Health and Cognitive Impairment Forensic Provisions Act 2020, ss 4, 28, and whether this condition absolved DB of criminal responsibility for the alleged actions​​.\n\n\nRatio:\n\nThe court reasoned that sexsomnia did not qualify as a mental health impairment under the mentioned Act.\nIt was argued that the absence of volition while asleep is a universal phenomenon and not a disturbance of volition, hence the common law defense of “sane automatism” continued to apply​​.\n\n\nDecision:\n\nThe judge concluded that sexsomnia did not constitute a mental health impairment under the Act and acquitted DB, asserting that DB’s condition made his actions involuntary​1​​2​​3​.\n\n\nApplication:\n\nThis case set a precedent regarding how conditions like sexsomnia are treated in the context of criminal responsibility for sexual offenses.\nIt illustrated an instance of non-insane automatism, updating commentary and suggested directions in reference to the Mental Health and Cognitive Impairment Forensic Provisions Act 2020​.\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 10B: Defences Part 2 - Self-defence and Intoxication\n\nSelf-Defence\n\nSelf-defence def - ss 418-423\n\nPurely statutory - no common law\nthe accused asserts they have been compelled by extreme circumstances or the threats of another to break the law\ndo not deny that the elements of the offence charged can be proved but instead exculpate the accused on the basis of some further fact, beyond the offence’s elements.\n\n\nSelf-defence burden/onus\n\nit is the accused who bears the evidential burden with regard to a defence, while the prosecution bears the legal or persuasive burden of disproving the defence\n\nQuestion of law, evaluated by judge\n\n\nThus the question for the jury to decide, once the accused has met the evidential burden, is whether the prosecution has disproved the defence beyond a reasonable doubt:\n\nWoolmington v DPP [1935] AC 462;\n\n\nWhere the accused has not raised a defence but the evidence in the trial nonetheless raises that defence, the common law approach is that the trial judge must instruct the jury that the prosecution must disprove the defence:\n\nPemble v R (1971) 124 CLR 107;\n\n\n\n\nCommon law self-defence\n\nIn general, a person could raise the defence if they acted in order to:\n\n(1) defend themself from unlawful violence;\n(2) defend another from unlawful violence;\n(3) prevent the commission of a crime, or\n(4) exercise a power of lawful arrest\n\n\nIn such cases, the accused was entitled to a complete acquittal if three conditions were satisfied:\n\n(1) the accused was genuinely acting for one of these purposes.\n\nClearly, the accused may not take advantage of such a situation arising in order to do away with an enemy;\n\n\n(2) the accused used no greater degree of force than they honestly believed to be necessary in the circumstances of the case.\n\nThis condition posed a test that was subjective in nature; the question is whether the accused believed the force used was proportionate to the necessity of the situation in which that person was placed; and\n\n\n(3) the accused used no greater degree of force than a reasonable person would have regarded as necessary in the circumstances of the case.\n\nThis condition posed a test that was objective in nature; the question is not what the accused believed to be reasonably necessary but what an ordinary person would have regarded as necessary.\nIn Palmer v R [1971] AC 814, the Privy Council took the view that [failing in condition 3], the accused’s defence would fail altogether and they would be guilty of murder\nZecevic v DPP (Vic) (1987) 162 CLR 645; 71 ALR 641,\n\nThe High Court disapproved of its earlier decisions and chose to follow the approach taken 16 years earlier by the Privy Council and the English Court of Appeal, Criminal Division. While\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZecevic v DPP (Vic) (1987) 162 CLR 645; 71 ALR 641\n\nBackground:\n\nThe appellant, Zecevic, lived in a block of units with his family in Melbourne, Australia.\nThe deceased was a tenant in the unit block.\nA deteriorating relationship led to an altercation between the two, after which Zecevic shot and killed the deceased.\n\n\nLegal Issue:\n\nThe case centered on whether Zecevic acted in self-defense when he shot and killed the deceased.\nSpecifically, did he have a reasonable belief that the use of deadly force was necessary to protect himself?\n\n\nRatio:\n\nThe court articulated that the test for self-defense should be whether the accused believed upon reasonable grounds that it was necessary in self-defense to do what he did.\nThe reasonableness of this belief should be considered in the context of the perceived threat.\n\n\nDecision:\n\nThe High Court of Australia allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial.\nThe judges stated that the jury should consider whether Zecevic believed that his actions were necessary in self-defense and whether he had reasonable grounds for this belief.\n\n\nApplication:\n\nThis case serves as a precedent in Australia for cases involving self-defense claims.\nIt emphasizes that the test should not involve any set words or formulae but focus on the reasonable belief of the accused in the necessity of their actions.\n\n\n\n\nR v Burgess (2005) 152 A Crim R 100\n\nPainted no war on opera house, “if we don’t show iraq we are not enemies, we may be targets”, Both argued in self-defence\nSelf defence cannot be too remote\n\n\n\n\nStatutory self-defence\n\nIntroduced to Crimes Act 1900 via Crimes Amendment (Self-Defence) Act 2001 (NSW\n\nre-established the doctrine of excessive self-defence reducing murder to manslaughter.\nCrimes Act 1900 Division 3 Self-defence\n\nss 418-423\n\n\n\n\nColosimo v DPP [2006] NSWCA 293\n\nBackground\n\nThree brothers got into a physical altercation with security staff at Star City Casino in Sydney after one of them was asked to leave due to intoxication.\nWhen the other brothers verbally abused the security guard and were also asked to leave, a physical confrontation ensued that resulted in injuries to four security guards.\n\n\nLegal Issue\n\nThe key legal issue was whether the brothers could claim self-defense to justify their actions, stating they were acting to protect themselves and each other from being deprived of their liberty.\n\n\nRatio\n\nThe court reasoned that for self-defense to apply, there must be an immediate and unlawful threat to one’s safety or liberty.\n\nIn this case, the brothers were not facing any such immediate and unlawful threat, thus disqualifying the use of self-defense as a viable legal argument.\n\n\n\n\nDecision\n\nThe New South Wales Court of Appeal upheld the brothers’ convictions for affray.\nThe court agreed with the lower courts that the defense of self-defense did not arise in this particular situation.\n\n\nApplication\n\nThe case serves as a legal precedent, highlighting that self-defense cannot be used as an argument for justifying acts of affray or physical confrontations unless there is a clear, immediate, and unlawful threat to personal safety or liberty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcessive self-defence: statutory provisions in New South Wales\n\nThe High Court of Australia abolished the common law doctrine of excessive self-defence in Zecevic v DPP (Vic) (1987) 162 CLR 645; 71 ALR 641.\nNew South Wales reintroduced excessive self-defence in s 421 of the Crimes Act (NSW).\n\n(a) all the elements of murder have first been proven by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt;\n(b) the accused genuinely believed it was necessary to engage in the conduct in order to defend themself against another person or prevent unlawful deprivation of liberty; and\n(c) a reasonable person in the accused’s position would not have considered the accused’s response reasonable in the circumstances\n\n\n\n\nExcessive Self-defence Onus\n\nIf s 421 is raised on the evidence or by the defence, the onus is on the prosecution to prove that the act causing death was not done in self-defence;\nthat is, that the accused did not (subjectively) hold the relevant belief:\n\nsee Crimes Act (NSW) s 419; Ryan v R [2013] NSWCCA 175\n\n\n\n\nSilva v R [2016] NSWCCA 284\n\nSelf-defence in a situation of domestic violence appellant\nThere was much evidence of extreme threats and violence by the deceased against Silva, including recordings of ranting and threats on the day of the homicide.\n\nThe prosecution had successfully argued that at the time the fatal stab wound had been inflicted, it was no longer reasonable for Silva to inflict a mortal injury, as the deceased was no longer a threat as he was being held down by two men\n\n\nOn Appeal, the court held that the deceased’s attack on Silva was urgent, life-threatening and inescapable, and the physical confrontation should be considered in the context of the hours prior to the fatal wound\n\nThe court focused on Silva’s perception of the threat, including her belief the deceased had a gun (when in fact he did not).\nIt was also accepted that her response of arming herself and stabbing the deceased was a ‘reasonable response’ to defend herself, or her brother or father.\n\n\n\n\nR v Katarzynski [2002] NSWSC 613,\n\nin New South Wales the questions to be considered by the jury when self-defence is raised are:\n\n(a) is there a reasonable possibility the accused believed their conduct was necessary in order to defend themself; and (subjective)\n(b) if there is, is there also a reasonable possibility that what the accused did was a reasonable response (not a reasonable person test) in the circumstances as they perceived them to be? (objective)\n\n\nIt was held that intoxication is relevant to the first, subjective question to be determined by the jury; that is, whether it is reasonably possible that the accused believed it was necessary to do what was done in self-defence, but not to the second question, being whether the response was reasonable.\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 10B: Part 2 - Intoxication\n\nIntoxication\n\nIntoxication, whether as a result of the consumption of alcohol or of other drugs, is not a defence as such.\nIntoxication is evidence that may go to the issue of whether the prosecution has proved that the accused performed the requisite actus reus with the mens rea.\n\nthe law on intoxication relates to the admissibility of evidence, rather than substantive law.\nIntoxication does not of itself excuse or exculpate an accused.\n\n\nIntoxication as a consequence of alcohol or drugs voluntarily consumed, and falling short of rendering the accused’s conduct involuntary, cannot, however, give rise to a defence to a crime of absolute liability\nIn the important case of R v O’Connor (1980) 146 CLR 64; 29 ALR 449 (at 16.26C ), the High Court of Australia rejected Director of Public Prosecutions v Majewski [1977] AC 443\nThe accused was charged with the murder of a girl whom he raped and suffocated.\nHis defence was that he was drunk and had not intended to cause either death or grievous bodily harm to the girl.\n\nThe accused was charged with the murder of a girl whom he raped and suffocated.\n\nHis defence was that he was drunk and had not intended to cause either death or grievous bodily harm to the girl.\n\n\nPrinciple\n\nIn relation to crimes of ‘specific intent’, intoxication could be adduced to cast doubt on whether the Crown had proved the elements of the offence, but that in relation to crimes of ‘basic intent’, self-induced intoxication could not be adduced as evidence to cast doubt on the Crown case. = Beard passage\n\n\n\n\nIn Bratty v Attorney-General (Northern Ireland) [1963] AC 386, Lord Denning stated in obiter that if a ‘drunken man is so drunk that he does not know what he is doing, he has a defence to any charge … in which a specific intent is essential’\r\n- specific intent def was invested with a distinct technical meaning and came to denote the intent required for an offence, over and above the intent to do the external actus reus of the offence: see R v Heard [2007] 3 All ER 306\n\nAka ulterior intent\n\n\nIn R v Lipman [1970] 1 QB 152, the accused and his girlfriend took a quantity of the drug LSD.\n\nIn the course of the hallucinatory experience that followed, the accused, believing he was being attacked by snakes and had to fight for his life, suffocated his girlfriend by cramming part of a sheet into her mouth.\nThe accused was convicted of manslaughter on the basis of both the negligent manslaughter doctrine and the unlawful act manslaughter doctrine\n\nCourt of appeal held that manslaughter was a crime of basic intent; that is, it can be proven by proof of the fact of having caused\nThe Court of Appeal noted that, had the defendant’s girlfriend survived the attack, the defendant would have been acquitted, because the offences with which he would have been charged — causing grievous bodily harm with intent, or assault occasioning actual bodily harm — were specific intent offences;\n\nSpecific intent offence def\n\nthat is, they required proof that the defendant had a specific intent of causing grievous bodily harm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Director of Public Prosecutions v Majewski [1977] AC 443, the accused was involved in a brawl at a pub in which he attacked the landlord and customers.\nHe also attacked the police officer who arrested him, another police officer while he was being driven to the police station, and, the following morning, a police inspector in a cell at the police station.\n\nThe accused’s defence was that the offences had been committed while he was suffering from the effects of alcohol and drugs and that he had not intended to commit the assaults.\n\n\nJudge held assault was not a specific intent crime, self-induced or voluntary intoxication by drink and drugs could not be adduced as evidence and was to be ignored by the jury in reaching their verdict.\nHouse of Lords\n\nTheir Lordships accepted as crucial the distinction between crimes of specific intent and crimes of basic intent.\nintoxication voluntarily induced will be admissible to cast doubt on whether the Crown has proved the elements of the offence or, put another way, to assist the defence to suggest that the accused’s acts were involuntary or prevented them from forming the mens rea of the crime charged.\n\n\nThe decision as to which crimes are of specific intent and which are of basic intent is clearly one of public policy rather than clear logic or principle.\n\npartial list of crimes falling within each category.\n\nspecific intent.\n\nmurder,\nwounding\nor causing grievous

offence\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarkins v R [2015] NSWCCA 263 demonstrates the intended reading of Pt 11A of the Crimes Act (NSW) as wholly replacing the common law of intoxication in New South Wales\nAs to the inclusion of new offences under s 428B, McIlwraith v R [2017] NSWCCA 13 treats as an offence of specific intent one which can be proved by knowledge of specific matters, in the same way as one where the state of mind involves a specific intention, and thus subject to the provisions of Pt 11A.\n\ndetermines whether error in finding the offence of intimidation under s 13 of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 (NSW) is not an offence of specific intent, and whether the offender’s intoxication at the time of the offence is able to be taken into account in the determination of guilt.\n\n\nMcIlwraith v R [2017] NSWCCA 13\n\n\nBackground:\n\nMcIlwraith was convicted for violating s 13(1) of the Personal Violence Act.\nThe trial judge determined that intoxication was not relevant to the case because the offense was not of “specific intent.”\n\n\n\nLegal Issue:\n\nThe issue was whether the offense under s 13(1) of the Personal Violence Act qualifies as an offense of “specific intent” under s 428B, in which case intoxication could be relevant to the accused’s mental state.\n\n\n\nRatio:\n\nThe court distinguished between “knowledge” and “intention,” stating that knowing an outcome is likely is not the same as intending it.\n\nBasten JA pointed out that s 13(1) should still be considered an offense of “specific intent,” even when the element of intent can be satisfied by knowledge.\n\n\n\n\n\nDecision:\n\nThe court ruled that the offense under s 13(1) of the Personal Violence Act remains an offense of “specific intent” and that intoxication could be relevant in proving the mental element.\n\n\n\nApplication:\n\nThe decision clarifies the scope and application of “specific intent” offenses, specifically in the context of the Personal Violence Act.\nIt also discusses how the state of intoxication can be relevant when the offense involves specific intent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINVOLUNTARY INTOXICATION\n\nInvoluntary or non-voluntary intoxication def is defined narrowly to encompass circumstances in which the accused is tricked or forced into consuming alcohol or other drugs.\n\nConsuming a seemingly non-alcoholic drink that has been laced with alcohol will be considered involuntary intoxication (R v Allen [1988] Crim LR 698), but underestimating the effect of alcoholic substances will not: R v Eatch [1980] Crim LR 650.\n\n\nUnder the Majewski approach to intoxicated offending, evidence of involuntary intoxication may be adduced in relation to both ‘specific intent’ and ‘basic intent’ offences.\nSimilarly, in R v O’Connor, Barwick CJ suggested that the principles to be applied are the same in cases of both voluntary and involuntary intoxication.\n\nAs Lane LJ stated in R v Sheehan; R v Moore [1975] 2 All ER 960; [1975] 1 WLR 739 at 744, a ‘drunken intent is nevertheless an intent’.\n\n\nin R v Kingston [1994] 3 All ER 353\n\nHow involuntary intoxication affects liability\nThe accused, who had paedophiliac tendencies, was blackmailed by former business associates who arranged for another man, P, who had similar paedophiliac tendencies, to photograph and audiotape the accused in a compromising situation with a boy\n\nP lured a boy to his flat, where he gave him what seemed an innocuous drink and some cannabis.\n\nThe boy fell asleep on the bed and while he was unconscious P invited the accused to sexually abuse the boy.\nThe accused did so and was photographed and taped.\n\n\n\n\nThe Law Lords affirmed the trial judge’s direction that Kingston could be acquitted only if his involuntary intoxication meant he did not form, or might not have formed, the intention to assault the boy.\n\n\nA different approach is adopted in the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth), where a distinction is drawn between self-induced intoxication and intoxication that is not self-induced.\n\ns 8.1 provides:\n\nFor the purposes of this Division, intoxication is self-induced unless it came about:\n\n(a) involuntarily; or\n(b) as a result of fraud, sudden or extraordinary emergency, accident, reasonable mistake, duress or force\n\n\n\n\nin the case of defences an element of which depends on whether a reasonable belief exists,\n\ns 8.4(3) provides that if a person’s intoxication is not self-induced, regard must be had to the standard of a reasonable person intoxicated to the same extent as the person concerned.\ns 8.5 provides:\n\nA person is not criminally responsible for an offence if the person’s conduct constituting the offence was as a result of intoxication that was not self-induced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatutory Provisions of Self-defence\n\nThe New South Wales provisions follow the Majewski approach\n\ns 428C of the Crimes Act (NSW) provides that self-induced intoxication may be a defence in the case of offences of specific intent.\n\nIntoxication in relation to offences of specific intent\n\n\ns 428B lists numerous offences as offences of specific intent, and a further set of offences as offences of specific intent to the extent that an element of the offence requires a person to intend to cause the specific result necessary for the offence\ns 428D Intoxication in relation to other offences\ns 428E deals specifically with the situation in respect of murder, manslaughter and assault causing death,\ns 428F Intoxication in relation to the reasonable person test\n\nReasonable person is not intoxicated\n\n\ns 428G Intoxication and the actus reus of an offence\n\n\nIn R v Grant (2002) 55 NSWLR 80,\n\nthe Court of Criminal Appeal held that murder in all forms, including cases of murder by recklessness and felony-murder, is to be regarded as a crime of specific intent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 10B: Part 3 - Necessity and Duress\n\nDuress and Necessity\n\nThe elements of duress and necessity are elicited at common law.\nThe elements of necessity are outlined in Loughnan [1981] VR 443, 448.\n\nThe defence must raise evidence to suggest a reasonable possibility that:\n\n\n\nThe act must have been done in order to avoid consequences which would have inflicted irreparable harm on the V or those s/he was bound to protect;\n\n\n\n\nThe accused must honestly believe on reasonable grounds that there was an imminent or immediate peril; and\n\n\n\n\nActs done to avoid the peril must not be out of proportion to the peril avoided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe leading authority for the elements of duress is R v Lawrence [1980] 1 NSWLR 122,\n\napplying Smith J’s formulation of the defence in R v Hurley and Murray [1967] VR 526 with approval.\nThe defence must raise evidence to suggest a reasonable possibility that D was required to do the criminal act:\n\n\n\nunder threat of death or GBH to a person if the act is not done (majority limited it to a personal threat), and\n\n\n\n\na person of ordinary firmness would have yielded to the threat, and\n\n\n\n\nthe threat was present and imminent, and\n\n\n\n\naccused reasonably apprehended the threat would be carried out, and\n\n\n\n\nthe threat actually induced the crime (ie. no other main reason), and\n\n\n\n\nthe crime was not murder, and\n\n\n\n\nD did not, by their own fault, expose themselves to the threat, and\n\n\n\n\nD had no means to avoid the threat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to distinguish between defences of compulsion\n\nAs defences of compulsion, duress and self-defence are particular forms of necessity.\n\nSelf-defence applies to a situation where D commits a crime to avoid or terminate one of the threats listed in s 418(2)(a)-(d)\n\n(e.g. D punches V to escape V who is running at D with a knife in their hand)\n\n\nDuress applies to a situation where D is induced to break the law at the behest of another and their will is overborne by the threat of infliction of violence on D or a person close to D, unless D commits the criminal act\n\n(e.g. ‘If you do not rob this bank with me I will shoot you!‘)\n\n\nNecessity is the residual defence.\n\nIt may operate when the other defences of compulsion are not applicable.\nIt refers to a situation where is compelled or induced to break the law to avoid more dire consequences (e.g. D steals a car to drive to higher ground to escape a tsunami).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 11: Police Powers\n\n\nIntro\n\nCriminal investigation is usually put into motion when an alleged crime is reported to the police or when the police identify a crime.\n\nThe police have a virtually unfettered discretion to determine whether the law should be enforced\nStructuring a rule or a discretion as a curial\n\nA common mechanism for encouraging compliance by police investigators with legal obligations\n\nlaw can be framed such that non-compliance with it may lead a court to exclude relevant evidence wrongly or prejudicially obtained through methods such as questioning, a search or an arrest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNature of police powers\n\nPolicy-wise\n\nAlthough policy-makers intended the introduction of tasers to curb the use of firearms, evidence suggests the opposite has occurred.\nNew South Wales police have been given additional search and seizure powers in relation to things used to interfere with business or undertakings under the Inclosed Lands, Crimes and Law Enforcement Legislation Amendment (Interference) Act 2016 (NSW).\n\nIn New South Wales, extended strip search powers have been given to police under the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Amendment Act 2014 (NSW)\n\n\n\n\nFunction\n\nThe police have both inquisitorial and adversarial functions in relation to prosecutions.\nIn terms of their interrogations, the police are responsible for deciding to apprehend, search, caution, arrest, divert, charge, provide bail to and question suspects\n\n\n\n\nAdvances in criminal investigation\n\nHow the field has changed\n\n\n\nadvances in science, including DNA, breath testing and computer imaging technology, which make many aspects of criminal investigation less dependent on eyewitnesses, admissions and other sorts of traditional ways of linking crimes and suspects;\n\n\n\n\nvideo, sound and digital recording devices have meant that interviews with suspects can be scrutinised while CCTV has both provided a means for identifying suspected offenders as well as monitoring activities in police cells (including those relating to deaths in custody);\n\n\n\n\nbody-worn cameras by police officers record interactions with the public and help gather evidence at crime scenes;\n\n\n\n\nelectronic tags fitted to the ankles of people who have committed offences enable the police and parole officers to identify when they commit further offences.\n\n\n\n\nPost 9/11\n\nAustralian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 (Cth) s 34D(4)(a)\n\nthe power to arrest and detain a person for up to 168 hours on the broad ground that the person might ‘substantially assist the collection of Intelligence that is important in relation to a terrorism offence’:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHUMAN RIGHTS, COMMUNITY PROTECTION AND REASONABLENESS\n\nprocedural fairness def\n\nrefers to how fairly the person under investigation is treated and whether he/she is afforded basic legal rights\nThe accused must be treated humanely and his/her innocence presumed.\n\n\nFactual basis for reasonable suspicion\n\nEstablished in R v Rondo (2001) 126 A Crim R 562.\nIn Goldie v Commonwealth of Australia (2002) 117 FCR 566 at 569, [6], Gray and Lee JJ underscored the importance of officers forming a ‘reasonable’ suspicion before an arrest in order to uphold the principle of ‘individual liberty’ that underlies that common law\n\n\nIn Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Shaba [2018] NSWSC 811, the New South Wales Supreme Court narrowly interpreted the meaning of ‘reasonably required’ under s 74A of the Firearms Act 1996 (NSW), which permits searches if it is ‘reasonably required’ to determine whether a person is in breach of a Firearms Prohibition Order (FPO).\n\ninvolved a search of a vehicle for a person who was subject to an FPO, where the police found cannabis.\nIn defending the drug charge, the defendant argued that the search was unlawful because there was no reasonable basis for the search.\n\nR v Ioannidis (2015) 124 SASR 86 at [22], in which the Full Supreme Court of South Australia held in relation to its Firearms Act 1977 (SA) that a police officer may be deemed to have lawfully searched a person, on the basis that it is ‘reasonably required’ to ensure compliance with a FPO and ‘for no other cause than to check compliance with the FPO’.\n\nSupreme court said too bad\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, where police actions, including force, go beyond those prescribed in legislation, courts have restated that there must be proof of ‘reasonable suspicion’ and that their acts must be ‘reasonably necessary’.\n\nMoreover, State of Western Australia v Cunningham [No 3] [2018] WASCA 207 concerned a couple, including an associate professor in Law, in Perth who were tasered, handcuffed and charged with obstructing a police officer, as a result of helping a man lying in the bushes.\n\nThe Western Australian Court of Appeal found that the use of force and charge was excessive and unreasonable and amounted to battery, false imprisonment and misfeasance in public office.\n\nTheir defence of self-defence failed because the officers did not believe or believe on reasonable grounds that it was necessary to use such force\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe common law accusatorial system of criminal justice provides accused persons with the following general rights and privileges:\n\nthe presumption of innocence,\nthe right to remain silent,\nthe privilege against self-incrimination,\nthe right to liberty from unreasonable state interference and\nthe right to the quiet enjoyment of their homes and their properties.\n\n\nFor over a decade Coco v R (1994) 179 CLR 427 (see at 1.17) has guided Australian courts in relation to fundamental common law rights in criminal procedure.\n\nIn Coco v R (1994) 179 CLR 427 at 437 the High Court restated this coco principle as follows:\n\nThe courts should not impute to the legislature an intention to interfere with fundamental rights.\n\n\nLee v New South Wales Crime Commission (2013) 302 ALR 363; [2013] HCA 39 at [186], which rely on Coco, reiterate that the fundamental common law rights extend to immunity for suspects ‘from having to answer, under compulsion, questions of the police’\nIn Momcilovic v R (2011) 245 CLR 1; [2011] HCA 34 [444], the High Court described fundamental rights or freedoms as including\n\nfreedom from trespass by police officers on private property (referring to Coco),\nfreedom from arbitrary arrest or search,\nthe privilege against self-incrimination and\nthe right to a fair trial.\n\n\n\n\nColeman v Power (2004) 209 ALR 182 illustrates the balance that courts and legislatures must strike in the creation and policing of public order offences\n\nPublic order offences are directly related to policing because they are often utilised by police officers to enforce their power and authority on the street.\n\nIn Coleman v Power, Coleman was conducting a protest relating to allegations of corruption against certain Townsville police officers.\nHe was distributing pamphlets to this end, and when Constable Power approached and asked to see a pamphlet, he was pushed by Coleman, who said loudly:\n‘This is Constable Brendan Power, a corrupt police officer.’\nIt was found that Coleman’s pushing and verbal insult provoked his arrest.\nColeman was convicted of using insulting words to Power in a public place under s 7 of the Queensland vagrancy legislation\n\n\nThe major issue before the court was whether s 7 creating the offence was constitutionally valid and, following on from this issue, whether Coleman had been lawfully arrested.\n\nThe court by majority held that the legislation was valid but that Coleman’s conviction should be quashed because any legislation criminalising the use of insulting and abusive words required a narrow interpretation.\n\n\nBlood testing, breath testing and tape-recording of police questioning are some of the trappings of modernity that extend and keep in check police powers of investigation.\n\n\nAl-Kateb v Godwin [2004] HCA 37 illustrates the ‘rights’ tension in this new legal landscape.\n\nIn Al-Kateb the High Court split 4–3 in determining the applicability of the Coco principles to provisions in the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).\n\nThese provisions permit detention of unlawful non-citizens until their removal ‘as soon as reasonably practicable’ from Australia.\nFacts\n\nAl-Kateb, an unlawful non-citizen and a stateless Palestinian, had been detained in immigration detention for four years.\nThe countries with which he had connection by birth or by residency, Kuwait and Israel, refused him entry.\nThe court was required to consider whether, with no reasonable prospect of removal to another country, the Migration Act provisions validly authorised the detention of Al-Kateb.\n\nMcHugh, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ, the majority, held that they did.\n\n\n\n\nGleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ dissented.\n\nApplying the Coco principle, they viewed the provisions as regulating only detention for the purpose of facilitating the removal of unlawful non-citizens from Australia\nIn their Honours’ view, the provisions did not apply where there was no realistic possibility of removing Al-Kateb from Australia.\nThe minority viewed the statutory obligation to detain Al-Kateb as\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFOUNDATIONAL ISSUES RELATING TO POLICE POWERS\n\nThe scope of reasonable suspicion\n\nPolice have the power to arrest a suspect once they have established a ‘reasonable suspicion’ of guilt, or the test of reasonable belief in some jurisdictions\n\nIf a criminal prosecution is to proceed to conviction, police investigations will usually need to have produced sufficient admissible prosecution evidence to satisfy the court ‘beyond reasonable doubt\n\n\nReasonablesnes is based on the objective standard in context of the officer’s subjective standpoint\n\nReasonable suspicion is discussed in R v Nguyen\n\n\n\n\nGoldie v Commonwealth of Australia (2002) 188 ALR 708;\n\nBackground:\n\nCain, an officer with the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, detained Goldie under Section 189(1) of the Migration Act 1958.\nCain based his suspicion on computer records that were outdated and incomplete.\nGoldie actually had a valid visa at the time of the arrest.\n\n\nLegal Issue:\n\nWhether Cain’s suspicion that Goldie was an unlawful non-citizen was “reasonable” under the Migration Act, and thereby justifying detention.\n\n\nRatio:\n\nAn officer must make due inquiry to obtain material relevant to forming a “reasonable suspicion.”\nA suspicion not grounded in fact does not become reasonable just because there is a perceived need to act quickly.\n\n\nDecision:\n\nThe majority held that Cain’s suspicion was not reasonable; therefore, the arrest and detention were unlawful.\nStone J dissented, saying that under the circumstances, Cain’s suspicion was reasonable.\n\n\nApplication:\n\nThe case sets a precedent for what constitutes a “reasonable suspicion” under the Migration Act.\nIt emphasizes the need for immigration officers to make comprehensive inquiries before detaining individuals suspected of being unlawful non-citizens.\n\n\n\n\nPolice discretion\n\nguilty pleas represent by far the most common outcome where charges have been laid, preventing the court from scrutinising the methods by which evidence was collected.\nEven if a policing issue is aired in court, the reality is that curial reviews rely on contested accounts of incidents determined after the event.\n\n‘Voluntary’ cooperation of suspects often follows peremptory ‘commands/ invitations’ such as, ‘We’ll go back to the station and sort this out’.\nAt law these interactions, amounting to ‘consensual policing’ are often invisible.\n\n‘consensual policing’ continues to suspend police obligations — including charging, considering bail, and offering assistance with respect to legal representation — that would otherwise apply after arrest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPOLICE WORK\n\nPolice officers are subjected to work stresses, pressures, inflexibility and shift-work that contribute to high attrition rates.\nWorkplace issues such as bullying, and, at the other end of the spectrum, camaraderie, are also described in the Lynch and Tuckey study\nA significant feature of police culture is the bond in police services.\n\nThe term ‘police culture’ has become synonymous with a strong code of solidarity among police officers.\n\na sense of mission about one’s work;\nan orientation towards action;\na cynical or pessimistic perspective about the social environment;\na constantly suspicious attitude; an isolated social life with a strong sense of solidarity with other police officers;\na clear categorisation of the public as either the rough or the respectable;\nconservative views on politics and morality;\nmachismo attitudes towards women, drinking and womanising;\nintolerance of minorities;\nand a pragmatic view of police work discouraging of innovation and experimentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatutory limits on police powers: LEPRA and the Evidence Act\n\nOverhaul of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) and the introduction of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 (NSW\n\nregulates and enhances police powers in relation to arrest, search and identification of suspects, with the most recent changes focusing on forensic forms of identification, which will be discussed in future chapters.\n\nreflecting ‘the views of those who believe “effective law enforcement” is of greater importance than the preservation and protection of individual rights’.\n\n\n\n\nLegislative limits on police powers in the Evidence Act\n\nThe uniform Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) applies federally\n\nNew South Wales legislated its own Evidence Act 1995 shortly after the Commonwealth Act came into operation, aka Uniform Evidence Acts (UEA).\n\n\nIn particular, ss 137 and 138 provide the major forms of discretionary exclusion for unfairly prejudicial and illegally or improperly obtained evidence\n\nUniform Evidence Acts\n\nUEA s 137 Exclusion of prejudicial evidence in criminal proceedings\n\nIn a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.\n\n\nUEA s 138 Discretion to exclude improperly or illegally obtained evidence\n\nEvidence obtained improperly or in violation of Australian law is generally not admissible unless the desirability outweighs the undesirability.\nEvidence from admissions made during improper questioning is also considered improperly obtained.\nImproper questioning includes acts that substantially impair rational response or making false statements knowingly.\nFactors the court considers for admissibility include probative value, importance of evidence, nature of the offense, gravity of the impropriety, and more.\nThe court also considers whether the impropriety violates international rights and if any other proceedings are likely related to the impropriety.\n\n\nUEA s 139 Cautioning of persons\n\nIf a person is under arrest, evidence obtained without prior cautioning is considered improperly obtained.\nInvestigating officials must caution that the person has the right to remain silent but anything said may be used as evidence.\nThe caution must be in a language the person understands and doesn’t have to be written if the person can hear adequately.\nThe rule doesn’t apply if another Australian law requires the person to answer questions.\nBeing “under arrest” also includes situations where the person is with an official for questioning and believes they cannot leave.\nExceptions exist, such as when officials are handling border controls or exercising certain other powers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT IS AN ARREST?\n\nArrest def\n\na means of physically restraining a person’s freedom of movement for the purpose of taking the person before a court to answer criminal charges\nNOT arresting\n\nthe stopping of a person for the purpose of a legal search and\nthe stopping and detaining of motorists under road safety, alcohol and drugs legislation for random breath testing.\n\n\nAn arrest will only be lawful if it is done in accordance with a specific power and for a proper purpose provided by law.\n\n\nAlderson v Booth [1969] 2 QB 21\n\nAn arrest may be achieved by words or conduct that make it plain to the person that he or she is no longer free.\n\n\nAn argument about whether or not an arrest has taken place will usually arise in the following circumstances.\n\nFirst, is the situation where the accused argues that there was no arrest at all or that any purported arrest was not lawful.\n\ntypically defending charges of escape from lawful custody or resisting or obstructing the police\n\nresistance to an unlawful arrest, or where there has been no arrest, is not unlawful:\n\nsee Michaels v R (1995) 184 CLR 117;\nPolice v Thomson [1969] NZLR 513;\nR v Jones; Ex parte Moore [1965] Crim LR 222 (cited by Macarthur J in Police v Thomson);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the second situation, it is the prosecution who argues that there was no arrest.\n\nThis typically occurs where the defence disputes the admissibility of an item of prosecution evidence, such as a confession, obtained during the arrestee’s detention\n\nThe accused argues that the evidence has been obtained illegally because the police failed to comply with the legal obligations that flow from the arrest.\nThe prosecution commonly responds to this argument by asserting that there was no need to comply with these obligations as no arrest occurred — the detainee was merely ‘voluntarily’ assisting the police with their inquiries.\n\n\n\n\nThe point has been made that because a volunteer has none of the rights of an arrestee, he or she is actually at a disadvantage in comparison to an arrestee.\nThis situation has also been criticised as providing the police with a judicially sanctioned loophole that may be exploited to avoid the obligations imposed by the law of arrest\n\n\n\n\nCommon law arrest\n\nAt common law, there must be an actual deprivation of liberty to constitute an arrest.\nBut where there is no actual physical restraint of the person, there still must be a deprivation of liberty, which may be proved by showing that the person submitted to the arrestor’s power.\n\nLicciardello v R [2012] ACTCA 16 is an example of a case where there had been no deprivation of liberty because, despite the announcement of the police that the defendant was under arrest, the defendant did not submit.\n\nLicciardello had been stopped in his vehicle after allegedly committing a traffic infringement.\nHe was asked to produce his licence, which he could not do because he was unlicensed, being a disqualified driver\nHe had just been released from gaol for driving offences.\nPolice told him he was under arrest for driving whilst disqualified.\nLicciardello responded with words to the effect that he did not want to go back to gaol, and thereupon walked around his car and ran away.\n\n\nThe question for the court was whether Licciardello had actually been under arrest, because if he was not, he could not be guilty of having escaped from lawful custody\n\nIn finding that no arrest had taken place, the court relied on Wilson v New South Wales (2010) 278 ALR 7\n\n‘The requirements for an arrest are\n\n(1) communication of intention to make an arrest, and\n(2) a sufficient act of arrest or submission’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn situations like R v O’Donoghue (1988) 34 A Crim R 397\n\n(where the suspect claims he was required to comply with police directions, but police claim that the accused voluntarily accompanied them to the police station, see below),\n\n\ncourts interpret police words and conduct in terms of their impact upon the suspect’s state of mind, that is:\n\nDid the detainee reasonably believe, as a result of police actions, that he or she was under arrest?\nDid the police use words or conduct of arrest which compelled the detention of the arrestee? or\nWas this belief merely ‘a product of his own mind’\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPOWERS OF ARREST\n\nPolice and officers in many government agencies have statutory powers of arrest (for example, customs and immigration officers etc) that are greater than those given by the common law.\nPolice officers\n\nArrest with warrant\n\nA police officer may arrest a person under the authority of an arrest warrant\nWhere an arrest under warrant takes place, the common law requires the warrant be shown to the arrestee.\n\n\nArrest without warrant — common law\n\nAt common law a constable or other ‘peace officer’ could arrest without a warrant in the following situations:\nto prevent the commission of a felony;\nwhere a person was found committing a felony or was reasonably suspected of having committed a felony (regardless of whether or not a felony had actually occurred);\nwhere a breach of the peace was occurring: R v Ryan (1890) 11 LR (NSW) L 171. 26\nAt common law, without a warrant, a police officer had no power to arrest a person in relation to a misdemeanour or statutory offence punishable on summary conviction with the exception of cases involving a breach of the peace.\n\n\nArrest without warrant — statutory powers\n\nCrimes Act 1914 (Cth) s 3W;\nLaw Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 (NSW) s 99;\nThere is only one legitimate purpose for arrest:\n\nto take a person into custody for the purpose of commencing proceedings against the person.\n\n\nThe New South Wales provision, which was previously similar to the Commonwealth provision, was amended in 2013 with the object of both expanding and clarifying police powers of arrest.\n\nLaw Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 (NSW)\n\ns 99 Power of police officers to arrest without warrant\nThe amendment expanded the list in s 99(1)(b).\n\n\nThe most significant additions are the following:\n\nwhere a police officer is satisfied that it is reasonably necessary to arrest in order to stop the person fleeing from a police officer or from the location of the offence;\nto obtain property in the possession of the person that is connected with the offence; or because of the nature and seriousness of the offence.\n\n\n\n\nThe police in most Australian jurisdictions have powers of arrest for specific offences or in specific circumstances under numerous and diverse statutory provisions, including firearms, fisheries, licensing, drug control and road safety legislation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE PURPOSE OF AN ARREST\n\nThe courts, therefore, have generally held that it is a requisite for a valid arrest that the arrest be made for the purpose of taking the arrested person before a judicial officer as soon as is reasonably practicable to be dealt with according to the law\n\nAccordingly, if a police officer arrests a suspect for a collateral purpose such as for questioning or to obtain evidence, the arrest will be unlawful:\n\nWilliams v R (1986) 161 CLR 278\n\n\n\n\nWright v Court (1825) 4 B &amp; C 596,\n\nIt is reasonable for police to think that any shortfall in evidence might be made up during interrogation and further investigation of the suspect after arrest.\nBut, as we will see below, this can be inconsistent with the purpose of arrest, which is to take a person into custody for the purpose of delivering that person without delay to a justice to be dealt with according to law:\n\n\nR v Kemp [2008] NSWDC\n\nIt is a New South Wales case where there is no power to arrest a person merely for the purpose of questioning the person (even if there is reasonable suspicion that the person committed an offence).\nFacts\n\nIn Kemp, the police were investigating some robberies of automatic teller machines that had occurred some months earlier.\nThey had a reasonable suspicion that the defendant was involved in the robbery, but their case against him overall was very weak\nThe defendant had, in effect, been arrested for the purpose of questioning in the hope of obtaining a confession\n\n\nHeld\n\nWhen the matter went to trial, Nicholson DCJ refused, in his discretion, to allow the confession to be admitted into evidence because, as he held, the defendant was arrested for an unlawful purpose.\nHe found that none of the reasons for arrest in s 99(1)(b) were applicable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImpact of an unlawful purpose\n\nThe purpose and, therefore, the lawfulness of an arrest may fluctuate over the period of the arrest.\n\nIf an arrest is made for an improper purpose, such as for questioning, the arrest will be unlawful.\nMichaels v R (1995) 184 CLR 11\n\nTherefore, even though the initial purpose of an arrest may be unlawful, once a proper purpose is formed, the arrest may become lawful:\nThe lawfulness of the detention was considered , in relation to a charge of escaping from lawful custody.\n\n\nGenerally, the issue of unlawful purpose arises before courts in the context of an attempt by the defence to have admissions excluded from the trial because they are tainted by an illegal detention:\n\nsee s 138 of the Uniform Evidence Law;\nBunning v Cross (1978) 141 CLR 54\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatutory detention following arrest\n\nCombatting Williams v R the

[1993] 2 VR 109 (CCA);\n\n\n\n\nIt may also ground an action in tort for false imprisonment.\n\nin Slaveski v State of Victoria [2010] VSC 441, [137], it was held that ‘the detention of a person in custody for longer than a “reasonable time”, contrary to s 464A(1) of the Crimes Act, constitutes the tort of false imprisonment’\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 (NSW)\n\nThe Act:\n\nauthorises the detention of an arrestee despite any ‘without delay’ requirement (s 114);\nprovides a limited period of time for the detention of an arrestee to enable investigation of the person’s involvement in a criminal offence (s 115); and\nprovides certain rights for the arrestee (ss 122–131).\n\n\nThe investigation period\n\nThe New South Wales legislation sets a reasonable time for the investigation period, but limits the total time to six hours:\n\ns 115 (under the previous s 115, the period was four hours).\n\n\nThis time can be extended by up to a further six hours where the investigation is being ‘conducted diligently and without delay’ but cannot reasonably be completed within the six-hour period otherwise than by continued detention of the suspect:\n\ns 118.\n\n\ns 116 requires (but does not limit) consideration of certain circumstances.\ns 117 provides that certain circumstances do not ‘count’ in calculating the investigation period\n\n\nAfter the investigation period has expired\n\nOnce in custody, a person must be released (on bail or unconditionally) or brought before an authorised officer or a court within the investigation period or ‘as soon as practicable’ after the end of that period:\n\ns 114(4)\n\n\ns 114(4) brings the ‘without delay’ principle into play, requiring police to conform to Michaels v R (1995) 184 CLR 117 and Williams v R (1986) 161 CLR 278: see also Coco v R (1994) 179 CLR 427\n\n\nDetention warrants\n\nA detention warrant to extend the investigation period beyond six hours may be obtained by telephone where it is required urgently and it is not practicable for the application to be made in person: s 61.\nOtherwise it must be obtained in person upon a written application: s 60.\n\n\nCustody manager\n\nA custody manager (custody manager def) is a police officer who has ‘responsibility for the care, control and safety of a person detained at a police station or other place of detention’:\nCustody manager must\n\nprovide an interpreter where there are reasonable grounds for believing that the detainee’s:\n\n(i) inadequate command of English; or\n(ii) physical or intellectual disability makes him or her unable to communicate orally or in writing with reasonable fluency: s 128;\n\n\narrange medical attention immediately if it appears that the person requires it, or if the person requests on reasonable grounds to receive medical attention: s 129;\nprovide reasonable refreshments and reasonable access to toilet and washing facilities: s 130;\nkeep custody records as required by regulations and by s 131;\nAnd caution the arrestee when he or she arrives at the police station (or other place of detention), give the arrestee a summary of the portion of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 (NSW) relating to detention after arrest and also fulfil obligations relating to a suspect’s rights to communicate: ss 123-127.\n\n\n\n\nthe New South Wales custody manager is not required to be independent of the investigation,nor is the PACE model of direct responsibility for protecting accused fundamental rights followed in New South Wales\n\n\nThe level of certainty necessary to justify arrest is far lower than the level necessary to found a conviction “beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nNote also that in establishing a reasonable suspicion (or belief), arresting officers may take into account facts and inferences which are inadmissible in a criminal trial.\nShaaban bin Hussien v Chong Fook Kam [1969] 3 All ER 1626 (PC)\n\nNot binding, but oft cited\n\n\n\n\nIn George v Rockett (1990) 170 CLR 104; [19901 HCA 26, the High Court had to consider the meaning of ‘reasonable suspicion’ and ‘reasonable belief’, both states of mind being required for the issuing of a search warrant under relevant Queensland legislation.\n\nThe court emphasised the need for there to be some facts on which the suspicion is rounded\nrecently considered in Prior v Mole [2017]HCA 10.\n\nMr. Prior was drinking in a public space and was visibly intoxicated.\nPolice Constables Fuss and Blansjaar drove by and observed Mr. Prior making an offensive gesture and shouting abuse.\nConstable Blansjaar apprehended Mr. Prior under s 128(1) of the Police Administration Act.\nThe Act allows police to apprehend without a warrant anyone who is intoxicated in public and likely to cause annoyance or commit an offense.\nThe apprehension was also based on the belief that Mr. Prior would violate Section 101U of the Liquor Act 1978 (NT) by drinking in a regulated place.\n\n\nThe Court of Summary Jurisdiction found Mr Prior had been lawfully apprehended pursuant to s 128(1) of the Police Administration Act.\n\nSupreme Court, Southwood J was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there were reasonable grounds\n\n\n\n\nThe case of R v Rondo (2001) 126 A crim R 562; [2001] NSWCCA 540 is the leading authority in New South Wales and provides an example of facts that the court decided did not amount to reasonable suspicion for the purposes of the relevant power (s 357E of the Crimes Act, which is now s 36 of Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 (NSW)).\n\nThat power allows police to stop a vehicle where they have reasonable suspicion with respect to certain matters.\nThe case also provides a summary of the law on ‘reasonable suspicion’.\n\n\nR v Rondo (2001)126 A Crim R 56\n\nBackground:\n\nRondo was pulled over by police while driving a “smart car” that had some panel damage.\nPolice searched the car without Rondo’s permission and found cannabis and money.\nThe case took place in Australia, and the key legal statute in question was s 357E.\n\n\nLegal Issue:\n\nWhether the police had “reasonable suspicion” to stop and search Rondo’s car based on him driving a fast-looking car with panel damage and not owning the car.\n\n\nRatio:\n\nA “reasonable suspicion” requires less than a reasonable belief but more than mere possibility.\nThe suspicion must be based on some factual basis, not arbitrary, and the officer’s mindset at the time of the action is critical.\n\n\nDecision:\n\nJustice Smart ruled that the police did not have sufficient grounds for “reasonable suspicion” under s 357E to stop and search Rondo’s car.\n\n\nApplication:\n\nThe ruling clarifies the boundaries of “reasonable suspicion” for law enforcement.\nIt emphasizes that the mere fact of driving a car one doesn’t own, without additional context, is not sufficient for a stop and search.\nThe decision could potentially impact how law enforcement conducts vehicle stops and searches in similar circumstances.\nThe test for “reasonable suspicion” is both subjective and objective:\n\nSubjective:\n\nThe mindset of the police officer at the time is important (“What is important is the information in the mind of the police officer”).\n\n\nObjective:\n\nThe suspicion must be based on some factual basis and not arbitrary (“Some factual basis for the suspicion must be shown”)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPropositions\n\n(a) A reasonable suspicion involves less than a reasonable belief, but more than a possibility.\n\nThere must be something, which would create in the mind of a reasonable person an apprehension or fear of one of the state of affairs covered by section 357E (the section at that time relating to the powers to stop search and detain).\nA reason to suspect that a fact exists is more than a reason to consider a look into the possibility of its existence.\n\n\n(b) Reasonable suspicion is not arbitrary.\n\nSome factual basis for the suspicion must be shown.\nA suspicion may be based on hearsay material, or materials which may be inadmissible in evidence.\n\nThe materials must have some probative value.\n\n\n\n\n(c) What is important is the information in the mind of the police officer stopping the person or vehicle, or making the arrest at the time he did so.\n\nHaving ascertained that information, the question is whether that information afforded reasonable grounds for the suspicion which the police officer formed.\nIn answering that question, regard must be had to the source of the information and its content seen in the light of the whole of the surrounding circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelying on third party’s suspicion or belief\n\npolice officer who Simply relies on a superior’s orders and arrests a person on another’s reasonable suspicion will not have the requisite state of mind.\n\nEven scanty information given in a briefing session can\nO’Hara v Chief Constable, Royal Ulster Constabulary [1997]1 All ER 129.\n\n\nFor example, where the arrestor relies on information given to him or her from a third party, the credibility of the informant will be relevant to determining the reasonableness of the arrestor’s view.\nIn R v Walsh 1990 NSWCCA, police acted upon instructions from a senior officer in arresting Walsh.\n\nThe arresting officers then detained Walsh until the senior officer arrived to charge him.\nGleeson CJ described this conduct as neither unusual nor irregular.\nHowever, a contrary approach was adopted by Zeeman J in the Tasmanian case, Hibble v Phegan (20 May 1997, Tas SC, unreported), where it was held that police officers did not have lawful authority to arrest if they acted solely on the direction of a senior officer without having formed their own view of the facts.\n\n\n\n\nArrestor holds a mistaken view of the law\n\nA suspicion is not necessarily unreasonable where the arrestor acts under an incorrect view of the law.\nFor example, in Dearing v Passi (4 November 1994, NSWSC, Levine J, unreported)\n\nthe arrestor’s wrong determination that particular land was ‘enclosed lands’ within certain legislation did not make his belief unreasonable\n\n\n\n\nArrest on a holding charge\n\n2.88 A holding charge (holding charge def) is a charge generally brought to justify the detention of a person suspected of other, usually more serious, offences.\n\nThe holding charge is based on a lawful arrest for a relatively trivial offence to enable police to question the suspect in relation to a more serious offence.\n\n\nHolding charges are used primarily to bypass the ‘reasonable suspicion’ requirement where it cannot be satisfied on the more serious offence, but can be satisfied on the lesser offence.\n\n\nHOW AN ARREST SHOULD BE MADE\n\nNotification of grounds of arrest\n\nCommon law\n\nAs a general rule an arrestor should explain to the arrestee why he or she is being arrested\n\napplies to both arrests for offences and to arrests made in non-criminal justice contexts, for example, pursuant to a power to apprehend a person under mental health legislation: New South Wales v Riley (2003) 57 NSWLR 496;\n\n\nThe principal common law authority for this rule is the House of Lords decision in Christie v Leachins 194 AC573. This\n\n\n\n\n\nAbbassy v Metropolitan Police Commissioner [1990] 1 All ER 193\n\nBackground:\n\nTaleb and Mary Abbassy were driving to Holland Park, London, when they were followed and then stopped by police.\nThe police suspected their Mercedes to be stolen.\nTaleb was arrested for “unlawful possession” and Mary for “obstructing a police officer.”\n\n\nLegal Issue:\n\nWhether the arresting officer had adequately informed Taleb Abbassy of the reason for his arrest, as required by law.\n\n\nRatio:\n\nAn arresting officer must inform the person being arrested of the true reason for the arrest.\nThe adequacy of the explanation for arrest is typically a question of fact for the jury, not a matter of law for the judge.\nThe arresting officer’s explanation must be assessed objectively, taking into account the circumstances at the time.\n\n\nDecision:\n\nLeonard J ruled that the arresting officer did not give an adequate explanation for Taleb’s arrest, making it unlawful.\nAs a result, Mary Abbassy’s arrest for “obstructing a police officer” was also ruled to be unlawful.\n\n\nApplication:\n\nThe decision underscores the importance of police clearly informing individuals of the reason for their arrest.\nIt also highlights the circumstances under which a judge, rather than a jury, may rule on the lawfulness of an arrest.\nThe case serves as a cautionary note for law enforcement to use precise language when making an arrest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatute\n\nNearly all Australian jurisdictions have codified the common law obligations an arrestor has to inform a person of the grounds for arrest:\n\nCrimes Act 1914 (Cth) s 3ZD;\nLaw Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 (NSW) s 201 (previously Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) s 563);\n\nPolice must inform arrestees of the reason for the arrest before, at the time of or as soon as reasonably practicable after the arrest: s 201(1) and (3)(a).\nThis provision also requires the arresting officer to provide his or her name and place of duty to the arrestee and evidence that he or she is a police officer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse of force in making an arrest\n\nAdditionally, modern arrest powers permit the arrest of all suspected offenders,not only those suspected of felonies.\nThe result is that the common law’s permission to use enough force as is ‘reasonably necessary’ to effect the arrest remains, but in a modified form\n\n\nR v Turner [1962]VR 30\n\nBackground:\n\nTurner had been a victim of multiple car thefts.\nHe decided to keep watch over his car, armed with a pistol.\nTurner saw a man attempting to steal from his car and fired a warning shot, which resulted in the man’s death.\n\n\nLegal Issue:\n\nWhether Turner was entitled to use lethal force to effect an arrest for a misdemeanour and whether the force used was “reasonable.”\n\n\nRatio:\n\nReasonable force to effect an arrest depends on what the individual believes is necessary under the circumstances.\nWhether or not there is a duty to arrest, as opposed to a power to arrest, does not affect the right to use reasonable force.\nThe concept of “reasonable force” is analogous to common law powers of arrest for felonies committed in the presence of the arresting party.\n\n\nDecision:\n\nThe appeal court ruled that the trial judge’s direction stating that Turner had no justification for using a lethal weapon was wrong.\nThe court quashed the manslaughter conviction and discharged Turner.\n\n\nApplication:\n\nThe case establishes that reasonable force can include lethal force, depending on the circumstances.\nIt also clarifies that the concept of “reasonable force” applies whether or not there is a duty to arrest.\nThe case serves as precedent for what constitutes “reasonable force” in the context of a citizen’s arrest.\n\n\n\n\nLaw treats lawful arrests resulting in violence to the arrestee as a case of lawful assault\n\nIn Lippl v Haines (1989)18 NSWLR 620 (NSWCA)\n\nLippl successfully sued for assault following an arrest in which he suffered physical and psychological injuries\n\n\nR v McKay [1957] VR 560\n\nwhere McKaywas found guilty of manslaughter after he had killed a (fleeing) intruder on his farm.\nLowe J held that it was open for the jury to find that the homicide was lawful where the accused acts in reasonable self-defence in the face of harm to himself,his family or his property\nthe verdict will be murder where the arrestee is found to have died as a result of excessive force\n\n\nHoneysett v R (1987)10 NSWLR 638\n\nconfirmed that self-defence is not limited to homicide but can apply to a charge of assault,\n\n\n\n\nStatute\n\nMost Australian jurisdictions have codified the common law power to use reasonable force in arrest.\nThe terms of those provisions differ,but all employ the requirement that force be reasonable or proportional.\nThe common law continues to applying those jurisdictions without specific legislation,and in all jurisdictions with respect to what constitutes ‘reasonable force’.\nThe relevant statutory provisions are as follows:\n\nCrimes Act 1914 (Cth)s 3ZC;\nLaw Enforcement (Powers And Responsibilities) Act 2002(NSW)s 231\n\ns 231 deals with the use of force in arrest in New South Wales\nIt allows such force as is reasonably necessary to be used, but it doesn’t make specific provision for force resulting in physical injury or death\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponsibilities of those who arrest\n\nstatutory obligations:\n\nto alert arrestees to their rights and to enable them to obtain support from friends, relatives, a lawyer and, where necessary,an interpreter\n\n\nthe common law:\n\nrequires a police officer ‘to take all reasonable steps to avoid acts or omissions which he could reasonably foresee would be likely to harm the person for whom he is responsible’:\n\nKirkham v Chief Constable of the Greater Manchester Police [1990] 3 All ER 246\n\n\n\n\nPolice liabilities: personal and/or vicarious\n\nAt common law, the independent discretion rule operates when police officers act within the wide discretionary powers at their disposal.\n\nThis rule makes senior police and the government immune from vicarious liability for any police tort committed by an officer in the course of duty, unless the officer is directed or delegated by a superior to act in a particular way: Enever v R (1906) 3 CLR 969;\nBaume v Commonwealth 1906 4 CLR 97. For example, in Jarvis v Her Ma•es ‘s\n\n\nThe government’s immunity from vicarious liability has been altered by statute: see Employees Liability Act 1991 (NSW) ss 3, 5;\n\nLaw Reform (Vicarious Liability) Act 1983 (NSW) s 6, Part 4;\nCrown Proceedings Act 1988 (NSW) s 5,\n\nwhich makes the Crown vicariously liable where the police officer would otherwise be liable.\nPolice are deemed to be in the service of the Crown and the independent discretion rule is not a defence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlawful and/ or tortious arrest / improper or illegal arrest def\n\nWhere there is no basis for the arrest, or the arrest is carried out in an impermissible manner, or it is for an improper purpose, the actions of the arrestor may be unlawful and/or tortious.\nThe arrestee will have two, or possibly three, avenues of redress.\n\nFirst, the arrestee may proceed with an action in tort such as assault or false imprisonment.\n\nIf the police have trespassed onto land, a private action can be brought on this basis also. There may be a basis for instituting a private criminal prosecution\nCommonwealth of Australia v Graves (1996) 41 NSWLR 111;\nMcDonald v Coles Myer Ltd (1995) Aust Torts Reports 81-361;\nLangford v Turnbull (29 May1990,NSW CA,unreported);\netc\n\n\nSecond, where the arrest leads to chargingand a trial, it may be possible for the evidence obtained in the course of the illegal detention to be excluded\n\nUniform Evidence Acts s 138;\nBunning v Cross (1978)141 CLR 54.\nAppeal courts as a matter of principle are hesitant to overturn a trial judge’s decision based on the exercise of a discretion\n\n\nThe third avenue available to a person seeking redress for an unlawful police detention is to set in train internal police disciplinary proceeding\nnone of these options provides expeditious relief to a detainee\n\n\nInjury to innocent third parties\n\nIf the police are acting in the execution of their duty,then they act lawfully and there is no legal claim that can be made.\nEach jurisdiction does, however, provide for ex gratia compensation to be made\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterrogation\n\nIdentifying the Right to Silence\n\nThe right to silence def\nthe right to choose whether to assist one’s accusers by answering their questions\nUniform Evidence Acts s 89\n\nin a criminal proceeding an unfavourable inference (defined as a consciousness of guilt) must not be drawn from a failure to answer questions put by an investigating official, and is inadmissible evidence if it can only be used to draw such an inference.\n\n\n\n\nLord Mustill in R v Director of the Serious Fraud Office; Ex parte Smith [1993] AC I at 30—1. Lord Mustill listed six ‘immunities’ forming the right to silence at common law.\n\nHis list can be summarised thus:\n\nIt’s generally not an offense to refuse to answer questions, including disclosing one’s name and address.\n\nPolice and others can ask questions but have no right to expect them answered.\n\n\nOne has the right to refuse to answer questions that may be self-incriminating, known as the privilege against self-incrimination.\n\nThere are some statutory exceptions to this rule.\n\n\nAt common law, suspects are not obligated to answer a police officer’s questions.\n\nSome regulatory agencies can, however, demand answers under penalty for refusal.\n\n\nAn accused person cannot be forced to testify at their own trial.\n\nThe decision to testify is solely up to the accused, although some states allow for adverse comments if the accused chooses not to testify.\n\n\nOnce a person is formally charged, police should stop further questioning.\n\nThis principle originates from the Judges’ Rules and is reflected in current English Codes and Police Commissioners’ Standing Orders.\n\n\nIn court, no adverse comments are allowed for an accused person’s failure to answer pre-trial questions, disclose a defense, or testify.\n\nHowever, the rules vary by jurisdiction, and some places like England and New South Wales do permit adverse comments for pre-trial silence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclosure of evidence before trial\n\nFor example,all Australian jurisdictions have statutory requirements of due notice as a precondition to leading alibi evidence:\n\nCriminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) s 15\nCriminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) s 141\n\nthe Supreme Court and District Court must order pre-trial disclosure in complex criminal trials\n\n\n\n\nPre-trial disclosure takes three forms.\n\nThe first is compulsory pre-trial disclosure by the accused were the accused intends to rely on an alibi (s150) or the defence of mental impairment due to abnormality of mind (s151).\nSecond there is the more general pre-trial disclosure applicable in all cases.\nThe third is specific pre-trial disclosure managed by the court to suit the particular case.\n\nUnder s 146, there is provision for sanctions for non-compliance with pre-trial disclosure requirements\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurnishing Information to the police\n\nthe only circumstances in which a person is required to aid the policies where a police officer calls upon that person to assist in making an arrest.\nLaw Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities)Act 2002 (NSW) ss 14-18\n\n(powers to require identity of drivers and passengers of vehicles suspected of having been used in connection with an indictable offence to be disclose)\nrequires a person to furnish particulars information to police or other authorities in specific situations,such as where drug-related offences are suspected of having been committed:\n\n\nS 3V of the Crimes Act 1914(Cth) is a more general power operating in relation to Commonwealth offences\nStatutes frequently make it a criminal offence for a person to be in possession of property reasonably suspected of having been stolen,unless the person can persuade the court that he or she had no reasonable grounds for suspecting that the property was stolen:\n\nsee, for example, Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) s 527C.\nOr an Act might penalise the possession of something ‘without reasonable excuse’.\ns 11B of the Summary Offences Act 1988 (NSW), for example,makes it an offence to carry an offensive implement in a public place ‘without reasonable excuse’.\n\n\nFor thieves and receivers, strictly speaking, the suspect’s silence can be taken against them, whether or not they were questioned.\n\nThe adverse inference is from the general circumstances,rather than any response to interrogate\nBrucev R (1987) 74 ALR 219;\nGilson v R (1991)172 CLR 35\nContinuing viability of the doctrine: R v Raviraj (1986) 85 Cr App R 98,\n\nit is not the accused’s silence which counts against them in the recent possession cases (among others),but their failure to take the first reasonable opportunity to offer any explanation of facts which seem highly incriminating\n\n\n\n\nIn Lee v New South WalesCrime Commission [2013] HCA 39, the High Court, by majority, dismissed an appeal from the Court of Appeal Of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, which had ordered that the appellant be compulsorily examined under oath before a registrar of the Supreme Court of New South Wales pursuant to s 31D of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW)(CARAct)\n\nThe majority held that s 31D, when read in the context of the CAR Act, authorised the Supreme Court to order such an examination.\n\n\n\n\nStatutory Regulation Of police interviews\n\nAll Australian jurisdictions have now legislated to regulate the conduct of police interrogations:\n\nCriminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) s 281 (s 23F)\nand Law Enforcement (Powers And Responsibilities) Act 2002(NSW) ss 122-1\nCan cause discretions allowing for the exclusion of evidence for unfairness,or because it was obtained illegally improper\n\n\n\n\nIn R v Lamb [2002] NSWSC 357,\nDunford J held that under equivalent New South Wales statutory provisions there is a positive duty to assist a ‘vulnerable person’ (which includes Indigenous Australians) in exercising his or her right\n\n\n\nRETAIN THE RIGHT TO SILENCE?\n\nNew South Wales has decided to follow the lead set by the United Kingdom with legislation drafted in similar terms in 2013.\nEvidence Act 1995 (NSW)\n\n89A  Evidence of silence in criminal proceedings for serious indictable offences\n\nan adverse inference can be drawn if the defendant failed or refused to mention a fact that the defendant could reasonably have been expected to mention at the time and later relied on in court.\n\n\ns 89A only applies where the defendant is charged with a serious indictable offence (punishable by imprisonment for five years or more); the defendant must have been given a ‘special caution’ as defined in the section above;\n\ns 89A deals with official questioning in relation to the offence charged, and permits unfavourable inferences to be drawn from failure to mention a fact that the defendant later relied upon in his or her defence of the charge.\nIt should be stressed that such unfavourable inferences are entirely separate from inferences drawn from a decision to remain silent at trial\n\n\n\n\nFor the rest of Australia, the law relating to the right to silence is that set down by the majority in Azzopardi v R (2001) 205 CLR 50\n\nBackground:\n\nThe Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) serves as a guide for what is permissible in terms of evidence and comments in court procedures.\ns 20 specifically addresses the circumstances under which comments can be made about a defendant’s failure to give evidence in criminal proceedings for indictable offences.\n\n\nLegal Issue:\n\nWhether, and to what extent, a judge or certain parties can comment on a defendant’s failure to give evidence without suggesting that the silence is an admission of guilt.\n\n\nRatio:\n\nThe law maintains the balance between protecting the defendant’s right to silence and allowing comments that serve the interests of justice.\nThe judge can comment, but the comments must not suggest that the defendant’s failure to speak is an indication of guilt.\n\n\nDecision:\n\ns 20 is upheld as a means to allow judicial comment on a defendant’s failure to give evidence, provided the comment does not imply guilt.\nThe section strengthens the judge’s position in terms of making such comments, compared to historical norms.\n\n\nApplication:\n\nThe provision is applicable in criminal cases for indictable offences in New South Wales, Australia.\nJudges need to exercise caution in how they comment on a defendant’s failure to give evidence, ensuring they adhere to the limitations imposed by Section 20.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR v William John Bennett [2015] NSWDC 1\n\nBackground\n\nBennett was originally convicted on two charges, including assaulting an officer.\nPolice officers claimed they arrested Bennett because his aggressive behavior posed a risk.\nBennett appealed, stating that the arrest was unlawful and thus the subsequent evidence should be inadmissible.\n\n\nLegal Issue\n\nWhether Bennett’s arrest was lawful, and if it was not, whether the evidence gathered thereafter should be admissible in court.\n\n\nRatio\n\nAn arrest is lawful only if there are reasonable grounds for it, and the arrested individual must be informed of the reason for the arrest.\nFailure to comply renders the arrest unlawful.\nIf an arrest is determined to be unlawful, evidence obtained as a result is inadmissible under s 138 of the Evidence Act.\n\n\nDecision\n\nThe court found that the police did not have reasonable grounds for Bennett’s arrest, making it unlawful.\nDue to the unlawful arrest, all subsequent evidence was deemed inadmissible.\nThe appeal was upheld, and both of Bennett’s convictions were set aside.\n\n\nApplication\n\nThis case sets a precedent that emphasizes the importance of lawful arrest procedures.\nIt underscores the need for police officers to have reasonable grounds for an arrest and highlights the consequences of failing to do so, i.e., rendering subsequent evidence inadmissible.\nServes as a cautionary tale for law enforcement agencies to respect individual liberties and legal procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicing the Pedal Rebels: A Case Study of Environmental Activism Under COVID-19\n\nBackground\n\nAustralia has seen a rise in environmentally focused activism, aided by social media and global coordination.\nExtinction Rebellion (XR) has gained attention for its theatrical and disruptive, yet nonviolent, forms of protest.\nThe study focuses on a small protest by the Pedal Rebels during the COVID-19 lockdown in New South Wales (NSW), Australia.\n\n\nLegal Issue\n\nThe article raises questions about the extent to which police powers should be used to regulate peaceful environmental protests, especially those that are compliant with public health orders.\n\n\nRatio\n\nThe study uses green and cultural criminology frameworks to analyze the excessive policing measures used against peaceful, socially distanced protesters.\nArgues that such policing is empowered by changing laws affecting environmental protest.\n\n\nDecision\n\nConcludes that the policing of such protests is disproportionate and represents an impediment to environmental activism.\n\n\nApplication\n\nThe findings can be used to critique and reconsider current policing practices and laws surrounding peaceful protests, particularly those focused on environmental issues.\nSuggests the need for a balanced approach in law enforcement’s handling of environmental activism, especially in the context of public health emergencies like COVID-19.\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 11B: The Law and Practice  of Search and  Seizure\n\n\nThe Law and Practice  of Search and  Seizure\n\nAs Coco v  R (1994)179CLR 427 indicates, legislation seeking to  curb individual  rights and freedoms  must  make that claim  usingclear and  unambiguous language\nExamples of the  speed of  change and the  diversity of search mechanisms include the  statutory provisions to  enhance  police investigations where  computerised records  are  involved:  see  s s  3K, 3L, 3LAA, 3LA, 3LB of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth)\n\nThe Surveillance Devices Act 2004(Cth) increased the offences amenable  to  surveillance.\nThe Act  expands the  range  of surveillance devices.\nThese devices include  listening,optical surveillance,tracking and data surveillance devices. Some do  not  requirethe  warrant process\n\n\n2013 amendments  to  the Firearms Act 1996 (NSW)\n\nPolice  were given strengthened powers  in  2013 to  conduct searches in  aid of FPO orders, which  enable  police, without  a  warrant, to  search  an FPO  subject’s body and  any  vehicle  or premises that  the  person occupies, controls  or manages:\n\ns  74A of the Firearms Act 1996(NSW).\nPurpose: to determine if the FPO  subjecthas committed  an  offence by having a  firearm, firearm  parts of  ammunition.\n\n\n\n\nThe  meaning of  s  74A  was considered  by Fagan Jin  Director  of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Shaba [2018] NSWSC 811\n\nBackground\n\nthe DPP  appealed against a  magistrate’s decision  to  dismiss  charges against the  defendant  of possession and  supply of  a  prohibited drug.\nThe  magistrate held that the search of the vehicle  by which  the constable had located the  drug has been conducted without  lawful  author\n\n\nHeld\n\n(1) The  power  of search and hence the  efficacy of the orders would  be reduced  considerably if  search were restricted  to  cases where  a  policeofficer  already suspected non-compliance (at [26]);\n(2) The  power  of search has  a  narrow focus  on who  or what  may  be searched and what  items  may  be searched for.\n\nBy Allowing Such  a  power  to be exercised without  the relevant  police officer  holding a  suspicion as  to  the commission of  an  offence, Parliament  has  not  effected  any  broad  or substantial erosion  of civil  liberties\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Telecommunications  (Interception And  Access) Act 1979 (Cth) regulates the  interception of telecommunications and, unlike the Surveillance Devices Act, a warrant is required for  interceptions.\n\nThere  is  also provision for detailed  monitoring and  reporti\n\n\nBroadly speaking, lawful search and seizure of property can arise in three circumstances:\n\nas an incidental power under a lawful arrest;\nby virtue of an ancillary common law power — such as that relating topreventing breach of the peace or retrieving stolen goods.\n\nSurprisingly, as we see below, the common law search powers remain contestable and unclear,even after centuries of articulation; or\n\n\nunder the authority of a search warrant or other statutory power of search (or surveillance).\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT IS A SEARCH?\n\n\nA particular problem with defining a search is that searches are not one-dimensional actions.\n\n\nIn  Nguyen v Elliott  (unreported, SC  Vic,  6  February 1995),\n\nBackground\n\nNguyen Refused to consent to  a  police search.\nTwo  plain-clothes police, Elliott  and  Brittain,  had watched  a  group  of Asian  youths on a  park bench ‘known to  be  frequented by drug users and dealers’.\nThe  police testified that  they knew  Nguyento  have been  involved  in  drug transactions previously.\nAfter 15 minutes  of  observation, during which time a number of Asian males had approached Nguyen and departed, the police approached.\nThey had not witnessed any transactions but Nguyen had looked anxious and alert during the period of surveillance.\nFought back and bit police and moved in car\n\n\nHeld\n\nThe police were merely curious to see whether Nguyen had drugs on him, and this did not amount to a reasonable suspicion.\nConsequently the search was unlawful and Nguyen’s resistance by kicking Elliott was proportional to the threat of the unlawful search.\nHedigan J found that the arrest that followed was also unlawful as was Brittain’s attempts to aid Elliott.\n\n\n\n\n\nBhattacharya v  New  South Wales  [2003] NSWSC 261\n\nBackground\n\nMr. Bhattacharya was found outside the Supreme Court building in Sydney after police responded to a call from court security officers.\nHe was known for his many “less than harmonious” encounters with court registry staff.\nFour days earlier, he had threatened to kill a staff member at the Court of Appeal registry.\n\n\nLegal Issue\n\nDid the police have legal grounds to detain, search, and take Mr. Bhattacharya for a psychiatric assessment under s 24 of the Mental Health Act 1990 and s 357E of the Crimes Act 1900?\n\n\nRatio\n\nThe statutory provisions permitted Bhattacharya’s arrest and detention only if he appeared to be mentally disturbed and had reasonable grounds for believing he committed an offense.\nA police search without an arrest was allowed only if there was intent to use “any thing” in the commission of an indictable offense.\nThere was no foundation to suggest that Mr. Bhattacharya was a danger or had committed a breach of peace.\n\n\nDecision\n\nMathews AJ found that the police had acted genuinely but wrongly in apprehending, searching, and detaining Mr. Bhattacharya.\nMr. Bhattacharya was awarded $15,000 for false imprisonment.\n\n\nApplication\n\nThe case highlights the importance of ensuring that police have proper legal grounds for detaining and searching individuals, particularly in sensitive contexts involving mental health.\nIt sets a precedent for scrutinizing ‘overbearing’ and ‘bullying’ police conduct on the street leading to arrest, search, and detention.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe case of Darby shows that even without technological advances, search and surveillance is by no means standardised.\n\nDarby v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) (2004) 61 NSWLR 558; [20041 NSWCA 431\n\nBackground\n\nRocky is a trained drug-detection dog used by the police.\nRocky alerted the police to Darby, who was then found to possess drugs.\nThe key issue was whether Rocky’s actions amounted to an illegal search, which would impact the admissibility of the evidence (the drugs).\n\n\nLegal Issue\n\nDid the actions of Rocky, the drug-detection dog, in sniffing and nudging Darby’s pockets, constitute an illegal search under the law?\n\n\nRatio\n\nA “search” generally involves looking carefully to find something hidden and, when it relates to a person, implies some level of physical intrusion.\nRocky’s actions were not for the purpose of searching but for identifying the person possessing the drug scent he had detected.\n\n\nDecision\n\nThe court held that Rocky’s actions did not amount to an illegal search.\nThe court remitted the charges to be dealt with in accordance with law, instructing that various legal issues could be reconsidered.\n\n\nApplication\n\nThis case sets a precedent for the use of drug-detection dogs in police work.\nIt clarifies that actions for the purpose of identification do not necessarily amount to a “search,” impacting how evidence gathered in such circumstances is treated in court.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Zealand Bill of RIghts Act 1990: Search and Seizure\n\n“search def”\n\nan examination of a person or property, and a “seizure” is the taking of what is discovered.\n\n\nEntering and searching private property without permission is considered trespass unless authorized by law or specific statutory provision.\ns 21 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act serves as a restraint on government action, not empowering the government to conduct “reasonable” searches.\nA search can be considered “unreasonable” based on the circumstances that gave rise to it or if it is executed in an unreasonable manner.\nThe core purpose of s 21 is to balance governmental interests against individual freedoms and privacy.\nPrivacy expectations are generally lower in public places than on private property.\nLawfulness of a search is highly relevant but not solely determinative in judging its reasonableness.\nSearch warrants are judicial authorizations that must be obtained when possible and should not be used for “fishing expeditions.”\nUnannounced or forced entries into occupied premises are likely to render a search both unlawful and unreasonable.\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT IS A SEIZURE?\n\nThe Full Federal Court in Hart v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police (2002) 196 ALR 1; [20021 FCAFC 392 (at [821) seizure def:\n\nThe content of the term ‘seizure’ is to be understood in light of its purpose which is to enable use of the things seized in the investigation of a suspected offence and at any subsequent trial arising out of the investigation.\nSeizure under a search warrant therefore involves a taking of possession that is temporary and for a specific purpose.\nAnything seized must be returned if the reasons for the seizure no longer exist or\nIt is decided that it is not to be used in evidence s 3ZV.\nThat requirement does not apply to the case in which the thing is forfeited to the Commonwealth or is the subject of a dispute as to its ownership.\n\n\nIn Kennedy v Baker (2004) 207 ALR 247; [2004] FCA 562,\n\nthe issue arose in relation to determining the scope of s 3L of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) in the context of copying data from a computer hard drive.\nBranson J held that taking such a copy constituted a seizure under the Act.\nHowever, it has been held that there is no seizure under the same Act:\n\nwhere police take items for examination under s 3K to determine whether they are satisfied that they are evidential material as described in the warrant: Hart v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police (2002) 196 ALR 1; [2002] FCAFC 392; and\nwhere police take items (unlawfully) and then return them to a location where a warrant applies keeping them in the police car for them to be ‘found’ in a search.\n\nThis occurred in Puglisi v Australian Fisheries Management Authority (1997) 148 ALR 393.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturning Seized items\n\nBunning v Cross  (1978) 141 CLR  54 and  statutory formulations of the discretion like s 138 of the uniform  Evidence Act.\n\ns 138  Discretion  to  exclude  improperlyor  illegally obtained  evidence\n\n(1)Evidence that  was  obtained:\n\n(a)  improperlyor  in contravention  of  an  Australian  law;  or\n(b)  in  consequenceof  an  improprietyor  of  a  contravention  of  an  Australian  law;  is  not  to  be admitted  unless the  desirabilityof  admittingthe evidence  outweighs the  undesirability of  admitting evidence that has been obtained in the  way  in which  the evidence  was  obtained\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPuglisi v  Australian  Fisheries  Management Authority (1997) 148 ALR 393\n\nBackground:\n\nPuglisi was being investigated by the AFMA for exceeding fishing quotas.\nInitially, invalid search warrants were issued and executed, leading to the seizure of evidence.\nNew, valid warrants were obtained, but questions arose about the propriety of re-seizing the previously seized items.\n\n\nLegal Issue:\n\nWere the items seized under the new valid warrants legitimately obtained and could they be used in the pending criminal proceedings against Puglisi?\n\n\nRatio:\n\nThe court found that for the items to be legally seized under the new warrants, they had to be “found at the premises in the course of the search,” which was not the case for items that were already in police custody.\n\n\nDecision:\n\nThe court declared that the March warrants were invalid while the April warrants were valid.\nThe court did not order the return of the seized items, leaving it to the judicial officer in the pending prosecution to decide whether the items should be admitted as evidence.\n\n\nApplication:\n\nThis case presents a complex situation concerning the legality of evidence seized under multiple sets of search warrants.\nIt emphasizes the importance of following proper procedures in obtaining and executing search warrants to ensure that evidence is admissible in court.\n\n\n\n\nLord Denning’s judgment in Ghani v Jones [19701 1 QB 693 has been highly influential, as has the approach of Horrid J in Elias v Pasmore [1934] 2 KB 164.\n\nGhani has been accepted in  several Australian  cases as permitting, retention  of  items  seized, particularly in  New South Wales  courts:\n\nsee  Greer Commissioner of NSW  Police (2002) 128A Crim R  586;\n\n\nIn Tye v Commisioner Of Police (1995) 84 A Crim R 147 (NSW SC) Studdert J accepted that an unlawfully obtained sample of blood could be retained for criminal proceedings.\nThis was distinguished by Bell J in Greer where the police had lawfully seized a diary which they claimed contained entries that had potential evidentiary significance should criminal proceedings be commenced.\nThe police had made photocopies of the diary before returning it.\nGreer wanted all copies returned or destroyed, or alternatively all copies of the diary, excluding reference to three relevant dates.\nBell J rejected the plaintiff’s claim.\n\nThere are obvious exceptions to this general no return stance.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, the High Court was unwilling to even delay its order in George v Rockett 1990 170 CLR 104 to ermit the swearing of a new complaint.\n\nIn TLC Consulting Services Pty Ltd v White [20021 QSC 434 the ability to print off copies of documents meant that it was unsustainable to argue that a computer server taken unlawfully (it was outside the scope of the search warrant) should not be returned for fear Of evidence being destroyed.\n\nHeerey J in Challenge Plastics Pty Ltd v Collector of Customs (1993) 115 ALR 149 declined to follow Ghani.\n\n\nThese sentiments follow those expressed by Nathan J in Ozzie Discount Software (Aust) Pty Ltd v Milling (1996) 86 A Crim R 387.\n\n\nThere is no obligation to return seized property if the possession of the property would be a criminal offence (for example, prohibited drugs).\nIt is otherwise if the items are merely indecent or obscene and/or not needed for criminal proceedings\n\nLawfully seized items are a different matter to those unlawfully taken.\n\nMost legislation is silent on the return of property. Whenever items are seized during a search permitted by search warrant based on a statute requiring the items to be taken before a court (see, for example, s 78(1)(b)(ii) of the Magistrates’ Court Act 1989 (Vic)) the seizure is provisional in the sense that the justice may order the return of an article thin or material consistent with the interests of Justice:\n\n\n\n\nSearch with an arrest\n\nWhere there is no arrest or other common law power to search, outside an express statutory power, the law is relatively clear — there is no power to search a erson or seize items from them.\n\n\n\n\n\nFilip Black v Regina [2017] NSWDC 326\n\nBackground:\n\nFilip Black was walking on Robertson Road, wearing a black hoodie.\nA police officer stopped him, arrested him for using offensive language, and conducted a search.\nBlack was later convicted in Local Court for using offensive language.\n\n\nLegal Issue:\n\nWas the search lawful, and was the use of offensive language punishable under Section 4A of the Summary Offences Act 1988?\n\n\nRatio:\n\nThe police officer had no valid basis for the initial arrest or search, making them unlawful.\nA reasonable excuse existed for Black’s use of offensive language, given the unlawful interference with his civil liberties.\n\n\nDecision:\n\nThe appeal court found in favor of Filip Black, stating the search and initial arrest were unlawful.\nThe conviction for using offensive language was overturned.\n\n\nApplication:\n\nThis case sets a precedent for what constitutes a “reasonable suspicion” for a police search.\nIt also clarifies what may qualify as a “reasonable excuse” for using offensive language under the given law.\n\n\n\n\n"},"UTS-Law-Notes/Database-Notes":{"title":"Database Notes","links":["tags/tag-notes","tags/tag-tutorial"],"tags":["tag-notes","tag-tutorial"],"content":"tag-notestag-tutorial\nAlexander Harb - 24715841\nSQL Joins Cheat Sheet\nINNER JOINS\r\nAn inner join between two tables will return only records where a joining field, such as a key, finds a match in both tables.\r\nINNER JOIN join ON one field\r\nSELECT *\r\nFROM ARTIST AS ART\r\nINNER JOIN ALBUM AS ALB\r\nON ART.ARTIST_ID = ALB.ARTIST_ID;\r\n-POWERED BY DATALAB\r\nINNER JOIN with USING\r\nSELECT *\r\nFROM ARTIST AS ART\r\nINNER JOIN ALBUM AS ALB\r\nUSING (ARTIST_ID);\nPOWERED BY DATALAB\r\nSELF JOIN\r\nSelf-joins are used to compare values in a table to other values of the same table by joining different parts of a table together.\r\nSELECT\r\nalb1.artist_id,\r\nalb1.title AS alb1_title,\r\nalb2.title AS alb2_title\r\nFROM album as alb1\r\nINNER JOIN album as alb2\r\nON art1.artist_id = art2.artist_id;\r\nPOWERED BY DATALAB\r\nLEFT JOIN\r\nA left join keeps all of the original records in the left table and returns missing values for any columns from the right table where the joining field did not find a match.\r\nLEFT JOIN on one field\r\nSELECT *\r\nFROM ARTIST AS ART\r\nLEFT JOIN ALBUM AS ALB\r\nON ART.ARTIST_ID = ALB.ARTIST_ID;\nPOWERED BY DATALAB\r\nRIGHT JOIN\r\nA right join keeps all of the original records in the right table and returns missing values for any columns from the left table where the joining field did not find a match.

Sometimes referred to as a proof model.\n“it encompasses, in my view, at least all of those matters which one party must prove in order to succeed in the proceeding and that the other must prove to establish its defence” per Branson J\n\n\nWhy do we need rules / laws that govern the use of evidence?\nThree main reasons:\n\nFairness – a way of ensuring that the parties are treated fairly.\nEfficiency – a way of limiting extraneous material to ensure the effective and efficient conduct of Court matters.\nStandardisation – allows for a degree of standardisation across all Court matters (consistency and certainty).\n\n\nUniform Evidence Legislation\n\nOriginally we had the Common Law Rules of Evidence – very complicated, convoluted and difficult to apply.\nIn the 1980’s ALRC conducted inquiry into problems associated with evidence.\n\nResulted in Uniform Evidence Acts (1995) in NSW and Cth jurisdictions\nSince that time other States and Territories have adopted the approach.\nAlthough the various Acts are described as ‘Uniform’, there are some differences between them.\n\n\n\n\nEvidence Act Structure\n\nIn NSW, the use of evidence in both Criminal and Civil matters is governed by the Uniform Evidence Act 1995 (EA)\nStructure of EA is designed to allow for a more systematic approach to the assessment of admissibility.\nUnder the EA, every piece of evidence needs to be rigorously assessed to assess whether, or not, it is admissible.\nBroken into major Chapters including:\n\nChapter 1 - Preliminary matters (application of the Act)\nChapter 2 - Adducing evidence\nChapter 3 - Admissibility\nChapter 4 - Proof\n\n\nUnder the EA, evidence may be classified as either:\n\n\n\nTestimonial (oral / written evidence given by a Witness) (oath by one’s testicles)\n\n\n\n\nDocuments (papers, electronic recording etc)\n\n\n\n\nOther evidence (views, re-enactments, real evidence - eg the weapon)\n\n\n\n\nEA allows the Court to ensure that facts are proven in a methodical and consistent manner.\nUnder the Uniform Evidence Act 1995 (EA) evidence is based on admissibility through:\n\nThe concept of Relevance.\nThe use of Exclusionary Rules.\nThe Use of Discretionary Rules.\n\n\nAim is to be more ‘Inclusionary’ than ‘Exclusionary’.\n\n\nAdmissibility – A 3-Stage Process\n\nIn assessing the admissibility of evidence, the Court undertakes a three-stage process where each threshold must be met before moving to the next step:\n\n\n\nRelevant / Not Relevant?\n\n\n\n\nIf Relevant, are there any Exclusionary Rules that apply?\n\n\n\n\nIf no Exclusionary Rule applies, should the Trial Judge use Discretion to exclude the evidence?\n\n\n\n\n\nEvifilta\n\n\n\n\n\nDocumentary Evidence Real Evidence\n\nDocuments Generally\n\nUnderstanding how documents can be used in Court / Litigation is an important skill for a lawyer to possess. Can be a very potent tool when handled correctly.\nMany forms of litigation rely heavily on documents being adduced as evidence.\nEA made significant changes to the Common Law about how documents can be adduced. Common Law was very strict on the notion of only using original documents.\nPart 2.2 of the EA deals with how the contents of documents can be adduced. Deals with how originals, copies, extracts, summaries etc can be tendered in order to bring the contents of the document before the Court.\nShould be noted that proving the content of a document is a different issue to how the content of the document is used/assessed in evidence. Getting the content of the document into evidence should be considered the first step.\n\n\nDefinition of “Document”\n\nIn the Dictionary of the EA\n“document” means any record of information, and includes:\n(a) anything on which there is writing, or\n(b) anything on which there are marks, figures, symbols or perforations having a meaning for persons qualified to interpret them, or\n(c) anything from which sounds, images or writings can be reproduced with or without the aid of anything else, or\n(d) a map, plan, drawing or photograph.\n\n\nClause 8 Part 2 of the Dictionary:\n\nReferences to documents\n\nA reference in this Act to a document includes a reference to:\n\n(a) any part of the document, or\n(b) any copy, reproduction or duplicate of the document or of any part of the document, or\n(c) any part of such a copy, reproduction or duplicate\n\n\n\n\nProof of Contents of Documents\n\nMain guidance as to the various ways that the contents of a document can be brought into evidence are dealt with under s 48 EA.\nUnder the EA, it is possible to:\n\n-Tender the document itself\n\n– s 48(1)\n\n\n-Tender a copy of it\n\n– s 48(1)(b)\n\n\n-Adduce evidence as to its contents\n\n– s 48(1)(a)\n\n\n-Tender a transcript of it\n\n– s 48(1)(c)\n\n\n-For voluminous documents, it is also possible to tender a summary (with leave)\n\n– s 50.\n\n\n\n\ns 48 also provides a way of utilising the contents of a document even though the document in question is not available to the party. (ss 48(2) and 48(4) refer)\n\n\nSection 48(4) Proof of Contents of Documents\n\ns 48(4) A party may adduce evidence of the contents of a document in question that is not available to the party, or the existence and contents of which are not in issue in the proceeding, by:\n\n(a) tendering a document that is a copy of, or an extract from or summary of, the document in question, or\n(b) adducing from a witness evidence of the contents of the document in question.\n[See R v Cassar and Sleiman (No 28) [1999] NSWSC 651]\n\n\n\n\nDefinition of “unavailable”\n\nPart 2 of the Dictionary: 5 Unavailability of documents and things\nFor the purposes of this Act, a document or thing is taken not to be available to a party if and only if:\n\n(a) it cannot be found after reasonable inquiry and search by the party, or\n(b) it was destroyed by the party, or by a person on behalf of the party, otherwise than in bad faith, or was destroyed by another person, or\n(c) it would be impractical to produce the document or thing during the course of the proceeding, or\n(d) production of the document or thing during the course of the proceeding could render a person liable to conviction for an offence, or\n(e) it is not in the possession or under the control of the party and:\n\n(i) it cannot be obtained by any judicial procedure of the court, or\n(ii) it is in the possession or under the control of another party to the proceeding concerned who knows or might reasonably be expected to know that evidence of the contents of the document, or evidence of the thing, is likely to be relevant in the proceeding, or\n(iii) it was in the possession or under the control of such a party at a time when that party knew or might reasonably be expected to have known that such evidence was likely to be relevant in the proceeding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR v Cassar &amp; Sleiman [1999] NSWSC 651\n\nD’s claimed that on the night of the incident they were driving around in a car.\n\nP was given leave to adduce evidence in reply that would show car was elsewhere on that night.\nPolice had evidence that car was at a motel at the time.\nWhat was this evidence and how was it adduced?\n\n\nEvidence was contained in a motel registration form which recorded name, address, car rego, check in date and room charge.\n\nProblem was that the registration form could not be found and therefore could not be produced as evidence, at trial.\n\n\nEvidence regarding existence of such registration forms and their general content was given by the motel employee, on duty that night.\nEvidence as to the content of the registration form was given by police officer who had inspected the original registration form and recorded the name, address, vehicle registration and payment details etc on a piece of paper.\n\nThis information was then faxed to another police officer who recorded it on a ‘running sheet’.\nSadly, the piece of paper and the fax of it could not be found at trial.\n\n\nOnly remaining evidence was the police running sheet. The question was whether that was admissible to prove the contents of the original motel registration form ????\nCourt held that:\n\n\n\nSection 48(4)(a) provides that a party may adduce evidence of the contents of a document that is not available by tendering a document that is a summary of, or an extract from, the document in question. The running sheet was therefore admissible (it incorporated the salient details) pursuant to s 48(4)(a).\n\n\n\n\nThe police officer should have leave, pursuant to s 42 EA, to use the running sheet to try to revive his memory.\n\n\n\n\nThe police officer could then give oral evidence of what he saw recorded in the original registration form pursuant to s 48(4)(b), using the running sheet to refresh his recollection.\n\n\n\n\nThe registration form was a business record of the kind referred to in s 69EA and that proof of the contents of the form would be evidence of the fact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal Evidence\n\nReal Evidence\n\nUnder the EA there are two categories of Real Evidence identified.\n\n-Exhibits (physical object tendered as evidence)\n-Views (demonstrations, experiments or inspections of locations).\n\n\nEA makes it possible to adduce evidence other than through witness testimony or through documents - this includes physical, tangible objects such as the murder weapon. (s 52)\nThe other type of Real Evidence (generally referred to as Views) allows for the conduct of experiments, demonstrations and location inspections. (s 53)\nDemonstrations / experiments / inspections can be very powerful evidence so the Court needs to be satisfied that the evidence gained will assist the Court in its deliberations and will not be unfairly prejudicial to the parties (particularly to the Defendant in a Criminal matter).\nImportant to ensure procedural fairness is observed and that the evidence is able to be tested or commented upon like all other pieces of evidence.\nNeither the Judge or any member of the Jury is permitted to conduct a View outside of the rules in s 53 (Bilal Skaf’s case)\nThe factors that the Judge needs to consider when contemplating whether to conduct a View are set out in s 53(3).\ns 53 does not apply to in-court demonstrations: Evans v The Queen (2007) 235 CLR 521\n\nUnder s 54 the Court may draw any reasonable inference from what it sees, hears or otherwise notices during a demonstration, experiment or inspection.\n\n\n\n\nSection 53 - Views\n\n(1) A judge may, on application, order that a demonstration, experiment or inspection be held.\n(2) A judge is not to make an order unless he or she is satisfied that:\n\n(a) the parties will be given a reasonable opportunity to be present, and\n(b) the judge and, if there is a jury, the jury will be present.\n\n\n(3) Without limiting the matters that the judge may take into account in deciding whether to make an order, the judge is to take into account the following:\n\n(a) whether the parties will be present,\n(b) whether the demonstration, experiment or inspection will, in the court’s opinion, assist the court in resolving issues of fact or understanding the evidence,\n(c) the danger that the demonstration, experiment or inspection might be unfairly prejudicial, might be misleading or confusing or might cause or result in undue waste of time,\n(d) in the case of a demonstration—the extent to which the demonstration will properly reproduce the conduct or event to be demonstrated,\n(e) in the case of an inspection—the extent to which the place or thing to be inspected has materially altered.\n\n\n(4) The court (including, if there is a jury, the jury) is not to conduct an experiment in the course of its deliberations.\n(5) This section does not apply in relation to the inspection of an exhibit by the court or, if there is a jury, by the jury.\n\n\nViews\n\nR v Milat (1996) (unreported)\nR v Bilal Skaf, R v Mohammed Skaf [2004] NSWCCA 37\nEvans v R [2007] HCA 59\n\n\nBilal Skaf Case\n\nNote - The Court is not permitted to go outside the evidence presented and to act upon information privately obtained which the parties have no chance of combating or commenting upon.\nIn a Sexual Assault (Rape) case the Trial Judge gave his usual warning to the members of the Jury at the conclusion of the Trial. As part of this warning, the Judge instructed the Jury not to “go and do your own research”.\nBut despite the warning, the 64-year-old Jury Foreman rang another Juror the night before the verdict was delivered and they went to the park where the alleged rape occurred.\nThe two Jurors went to Gosling Park for about 20 minutes to check the lighting conditions (obviously an issue that had been causing some concern to the Jury).\nAt the Trial, the two Jurors had not told the Judge or anybody else what they had done.\nAt a BBQ some time later, the Foreman told a Solicitor that he and another had gone to the park. The Foreman said he only went to the park to `clarify something for my own mind’. Quite correctly, the Solicitor reported the conversation to the NSW Sheriff.\nAs a result, the matter went to Appeal and the Judges in the NSWCCA found the experiment was a miscarriage of justice.\n\n“In our view there must, regrettably, be a new trial because of this ground,” the judges said.\n\n\nThey also ordered that in future more specific orders be given to Juries to ensure further trials were not miscarried because of ‘Jury misconduct’.\nNSWCCA stated that orders should include:\n\nnot making private visits to the crime scene;\nnot asking other Jurors to conduct experiments; and\ninforming the Trial Judge if they discover fellow Jurors making independent inquiries into the case.\n\n\nThe NSWCCA decision to order a retrial led to the NSW Government to amend the Jury Act – amendment allows for the punishment of those who conduct unauthorised experiments away from court.\n\n\n\n\nThree types of evidence\n\nOral testimony, documents, real evidence\n\n\nR v L Cassar; R v E Sleiman (Judgment No 28) [1999] NSWSC 651\n\nCourt: Supreme Court of New South Wales\nJudge: Sperling J\nParties: Regina v Leanne Cassar; Regina v Emad Sleiman\nKey Issues:\n\nThe admissibility of secondary evidence, specifically a police running sheet, to prove the contents of a lost motel registration form.\nWhether a witness could use a document prepared by another to refresh their memory.\n\n\nDecision:\n\nThe court held that the running sheet was admissible under section 48(4)(a) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) as a summary of the original document, which was unavailable.\nThe court granted leave for a police officer to use the running sheet to refresh his memory under section 32 of the Act, allowing him to provide oral evidence of the contents of the lost registration form.\n\n\nSignificance:\n\nThe case illustrates the application of sections 32 and 48 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) concerning the admissibility of secondary evidence and the conditions under which a witness can refresh their memory using documents not prepared by them.\n\n\n\n\nCase Summary: Evans v The Queen [2007] HCA 59\n\nCourt: High Court of Australia\nJudges: Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne, and Heydon JJ\nJudgment Date: 13 December 2007\nParties: Evans (Appellant) v The Queen (Respondent)\nProcedural History:\n\nEvans was convicted of armed robbery in a lower court.\nThe conviction was based in part on an in-court demonstration where Evans was required to wear clothing similar to that worn by the offender and to speak words alleged to have been spoken during the robbery.\nEvans appealed to the High Court, arguing that the demonstration was inadmissible due to its prejudicial nature.\n\n\nFacts:\n\nEvans was accused of an armed robbery where the offender was described as wearing overalls, a balaclava, and sunglasses.\nDuring the trial, the prosecution had Evans wear similar clothing and speak specific words in front of the jury to compare with witness descriptions.\nThe defense argued that this demonstration was prejudicial and did not have sufficient probative value.\n\n\nLegal Issue:\n\nWhether the in-court demonstration was admissible, considering the balance between its probative value and potential prejudice to the accused.\n\n\nDecision:\n\nThe High Court upheld the admissibility of the in-court demonstration.\nThe Court found the demonstration relevant and useful for the jury in assessing the identity of the offender.\nThe probative value of the evidence was deemed to outweigh any potential for unfair prejudice.\n\n\nRatio Decidendi:\n\nThe admissibility of in-court demonstrations depends on the discretion of the judge, who must weigh the probative value of the evidence against the risk of prejudice.\nIn this case, the demonstration was relevant to the key issue of identity, and its potential prejudicial effect was not sufficient to exclude it from evidence.\n\n\nSignificance:\n\nEvans v The Queen is an important case in evidence law, setting a precedent for the admissibility of in-court demonstrations.\nIt highlights the need for careful judicial balancing between the probative value of evidence and the risk of unfair prejudice to ensure a fair trial.\nThis case is often referenced in legal discussions concerning the limits and conditions for admitting similar in-court evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 2: Witness Competence, Compellability, and Examniation\n\nWeek 2: Witnesses\n\nR v Khan NSWSC 1995\n\nCourt: Supreme Court of New South Wales\nParties:\n\nProsecution: Regina (The Crown)\nDefendant: Gulam Mohammad Khan\n\n\nProcedural History:\n\nGulam Mohammad Khan was on trial for the murder of Mohammad Abbas.\nThe Crown sought to compel Mr. Khan’s wife, Jatun Bibi Khan, to testify against her husband.\n\n\nOriginal Dispute:\n\nThe dispute originated from the events of 4 December 1993, when Gulam Mohammad Khan allegedly murdered Mohammad Abbas, who had been living with the Khan family.\nThe prosecution aimed to call Mrs. Khan as a witness to testify about her relationship with Abbas and the circumstances surrounding the murder.\n\n\nReason for Trial:\n\nThe trial was convened to determine Mr. Khan’s guilt in the murder of Mohammad Abbas, with the Crown seeking to establish that the killing was not the result of a sudden loss of self-control (provocation) but rather a premeditated act of revenge.\n\n\nMaterial Facts:\n\nMohammad Abbas, a friend of the Khan family, had been living with them for some time. During Mr. Khan’s absence in Fiji, Mrs. Khan’s relationship with Abbas grew closer, and they became sexually involved shortly before the murder.\nOn the night of the murder, Mr. Khan allegedly caught them together and, in a fit of rage, stabbed Abbas multiple times. Mrs. Khan’s initial statement to the police implicated her husband, but she later indicated that she would retract some of that statement if called to testify, claiming that her involvement with Abbas was coerced.\n\n\nIssue Raised:\n\nThe central issue was whether the court should compel Mrs. Khan to testify against her husband despite her objection, balancing the harm that might be caused to the marital relationship against the need for her testimony in the interests of justice.\n\n\nLaw(s)/Statute(s) in Contention:\n\nSection 18 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW):\n\nThis section allows a court to compel a witness, including a spouse, to testify even if they object, provided that the court determines the necessity of the evidence outweighs any potential harm to the witness or their relationship with the defendant.\n\n\nSection 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW):\n\nThis section provides the court with discretion to exclude evidence if its probative value is outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice to the defendant.\n\n\n\n\nPrecedences:\n\nRichardson v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 116: The Crown referenced this case in arguing that Mrs. Khan’s prior statement to the police could be used as evidence, even if she recanted it during her testimony.\nR v Blewitt (1988) 62 ALR 503: This case was cited regarding the admissibility of prior statements when a witness deviates from their earlier testimony.\n\n\nTests:\n\nThe court applied the balancing test outlined in section 18(6) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), considering the potential harm to Mrs. Khan and her marital relationship against the importance of her testimony to the Crown’s case.\n\n\nWords and Phrases Considered:\n\n“Provocation”: The defense centered on whether Mr. Khan acted under sudden provocation upon discovering his wife with Abbas, which could reduce his culpability from murder to manslaughter.\n“Harm to relationship”: The court considered the nature of the harm that compelling Mrs. Khan to testify might cause to her marital relationship.\n\n\nArguments by Party:\n\nProsecution: Argued that Mrs. Khan’s testimony was crucial to establishing the sequence of events leading to Abbas’s death, particularly to counter the defense’s claim of provocation.\n\nThe Crown also contended that Mrs. Khan’s initial police statement could be treated as evidence under the new Evidence Act, even if she retracted it on the stand.\n\n\nDefense: Argued that compelling Mrs. Khan to testify would cause significant harm to her marital relationship, which still endured despite the charges.\n\nThe defense also suggested that her testimony would lack credibility and that its key points could be corroborated by other evidence, making it unnecessary to compel her testimony.\n\n\n\n\nJudicial Opinions:\n\nThe court, presided over by Justice Abadee, weighed the arguments presented by both parties.\nJustice Abadee acknowledged the potential importance of Mrs. Khan’s testimony but ultimately decided that the harm to her relationship with her husband outweighed the benefits of compelling her testimony.\n\n\nLegal Reasoning:\n\nThe court reasoned that although Mrs. Khan’s testimony could be relevant to the issue of provocation, the potential harm to the marital relationship was significant.\nThe court also noted that much of the evidence Mrs. Khan could provide was available from other sources, including the defendant’s own statements to the police and other witnesses.\nTherefore, the court chose not to compel Mrs. Khan to testify, as the damage to the marriage outweighed the evidentiary value her testimony might provide.\n\n\nRatio Decidendi:\n\nThe court’s decision was based on the principle that the harm likely to be caused to Mrs. Khan’s marital relationship by compelling her to testify outweighed the desirability of having her evidence presented in court.\nThe ruling emphasized the court’s discretion under section 18 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), prioritizing the protection of personal relationships where the evidentiary value does not justify the potential harm.\n\n\nResult:\n\nThe court ruled that Mrs. Khan would not be compelled to testify against her husband, and her prior statement to the police was not admitted as evidence.\n\n\nRelevance to Modern Law:\n\nThis case remains relevant in discussions about the limits of compelling testimony from unwilling witnesses, especially within family contexts.\nIt highlights the judiciary’s role in safeguarding personal relationships from undue harm during legal proceedings and serves as a precedent for similar cases involving the compellability of spousal testimony.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2A: Witness Competence &amp;

(s 42(1) refers).\nWhen deciding whether to disallow the question, or give such a direction not to answer in accordance with s 42, the court may take into account the extent to which:\n\n(a) the evidence given by the witness in examination-in-chief is unfavourable to the party who called the witness, and\n(b) the witness has an interest that is consistent with an interest of the cross-examiner, and\n(c) the witness is sympathetic to the party conducting the cross-examination, either generally or about a particular matter, and\n(d) the witness’s age, or any mental, intellectual or physical disability to which the witness is subject, may affect the witness’s answers.\n\n\nThe factors in s 42(2)(a)-(c) allow a judge to disallow a question where there are reasons to believe that the witness is favourably inclined to the cross-examining party.\nArguably, s 42(2)(c) suggests that a question should be disallowed where there is a danger that the witness is unusually susceptible to suggestive questioning making the evidence unreliable.\nPursuant to s 42(3), the court is to disallow the question, or direct the witness not to answer it, if it is satisfied that the facts concerned would be better ascertained if leading questions were not used.\nShould be noted that s 42 does not limit the court’s power to control leading questions (s 42(4) refers).\n\n\nThe Rule in Browne v Dunn\n\nAn essential aspect of fairness in court process is ensuring that one party has the opportunity to answer the claims or allegations of another.\n\nThe opposing party must be put on notice of the case that they must answer.\n\n\nTo address this, the Rule in Browne v Dunn was developed which requires a cross-examining party that intends to contradict a witness by adducing other evidence, to put as much of their own case that concerns that witness to them, and if it is intended to suggest that a witness is not speaking the truth on a particular matter, that their attention is drawn to what will be suggested about it so that they might have an opportunity to explain.\nBrowne and Dunn is not a rule of evidence - it is a rule of procedural fairness.\n\n\nRule in Browne v Dunn\n\nWhen W is giving evidence and you intend to call evidence that contradicts them, you must put the substance of that contradictory evidence to the witness during cross-examination and give them the opportunity to comment on it.\nUnfair to deny W the opportunity of explaining a point that will later be used to invite criticism or disbelief in their evidence\nDuty for parties to ‘put’ to W any matter that may be used to suggest their evidence is untruthful, unreliable or which contradicts their testimony\nCan be done in a formal manner ‘I put it to you that…’ or it may be done in a more natural, conversational style as part of the general cross examination, such as ‘Isn’t it true that…’\nFailure to observe may result in adverse consequences eg recall W, exclude evidence, jury direction, dismiss jury\n\n\n\n\nThe Rule in Browne v Dunn\n\nIf the Rule in Browne v Dunn is not observed, there are several different ways that the Court can deal with the issue:\n\n– Prevent non-compliant party from submitting that opponent’s evidence should not be believed.\n– Exclude evidence given by a non-compliant party.\n– Recall Witness: s 46\n– Allow cross-examination of non-compliant party\n– Comment on non-compliance; lesser weight given to their evidence.\n\n\nMarelic v Comcare [1993] FCA 599 provides a good overview of how the Rule in Browne v Dunn should be applied.\n\n\nReviving Memory\n\nA witness must not, in the course of giving evidence, use a document to try to revive his or her memory about a fact or opinion unless the court gives leave (s 42).\nDespites 42, in any criminal proceeding, a police officer may give evidence-in-chief for the prosecution by reading or being led through a written statement previously made by the police officer (s 43).\nIf a witness attempts to revive his / her memory ‘out of court’, the court may, on the request of a party, give directions that the documents / things used by the witness to revive his or her memory are produced to the party (s 44).\n\n\ns 48 Unfavourable Witnesses\n\n(1) A party who called a witness may, with the leave of the court, question the witness as though the party were cross-examining the witness, about:\n\n(a) evidence given by the witness that is unfavourable to the party, or\n(b) a matter of which the witness may reasonably be supposed to have knowledge and about which it appears to the court the witness is not, in examination in chief, making a genuine attempt to give evidence, or\n(c) whether the witness has, at any time, made a prior inconsistent statement. […]\n\n\n\n\ns 41 - Improper Questions\n\nThe court must disallow a question put to a witness in cross-examination, or inform the witness that it need not be answered, if the court is of the opinion that the question is:\n\n– Misleading, confusing, unduly annoying, harassing intimidating, offensive, oppressive, humiliating, repetitive.\n– In a tone that is belittling, insulting, otherwise inappropriate.\n– Has no basis other than a stereotype (sex, race, culture, ethnicity, age, mental, intellectual or physical disability)\n\n\n\n\ns 43 Prior Inconsistent Statements of Witnesses\n\n(1) A witness may be cross-examined about a prior inconsistent statement alleged to have been made by the witness…\n(2) If, in cross-examination, a witness does not admit that he or she has made a prior inconsistent statement, the cross-examiner is not to adduce evidence of the statement otherwise than from the witness unless, in the cross-examination, the cross-examiner:\n\n(a) informed the witness of enough of the circumstances of the making of the statement to enable the witness to identify the statement, and\n(b) drew the witness’s attention to so much of the statement as is inconsistent with the witness’s evidence\n\n\n\n\nR v Glasby [2000] NSWCCA 83 (22 June 2000)\n\nProcedural History:\n\nGarry Zane Glasby was convicted of murder in the Supreme Court of New South Wales on 11 June 1998.\nHe was sentenced to life imprisonment.\nGlasby appealed both his conviction and sentence to the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal (NSWCCA) on several grounds, including the admissibility of his wife’s testimony, errors in jury directions, and the severity of his sentence.\n\n\nOriginal Dispute:\n\nThe dispute arose from the murder of John Albert Thiessl, allegedly carried out by Garry Zane Glasby on 6 November 1994 as part of a contract killing arranged by the victim’s wife, Carmela Thiessl.\n\n\nReason for Trial:\n\nGlasby was tried for the murder of John Albert Thiessl.\nThe Crown’s case was that the murder was premeditated and carried out for financial gain.\nGlasby pleaded not guilty, claiming he had no involvement in the murder.\n\n\nMaterial Facts:\n\nThe Crown alleged that Carmela Thiessl contracted Glasby to kill her husband in exchange for a substantial sum of money.\nMrs. Suzette Glasby, the appellant’s wife, was involved in luring the victim to his death and driving Glasby from the scene of the crime.\nEvidence against Glasby included testimony from Mrs. Glasby, recorded conversations implying Glasby’s involvement, and circumstantial evidence linking him to the crime.\n\n\nIssue Raised:\n\nWhether the trial judge erred in compelling Mrs. Glasby to testify and allowing her cross-examination under s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995.\nWhether the trial judge adequately instructed the jury on the use of hearsay evidence provided by Mrs. Glasby.\nWhether the trial judge should have discharged the jury due to prejudicial comments made by Mrs. Glasby.\nWhether the life sentence imposed on Glasby was manifestly excessive compared to the sentence imposed on Mrs. Glasby.\n\n\nLaw(s)/Statute(s) in Contention:\n\nEvidence Act 1995 (NSW) – particularly ss 18, 38, and 60 (relating to compellability of witnesses, cross-examination, and hearsay).\nCriminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 6(1) – regarding the application of the proviso in appeals.\nCrimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 19A – relating to the imposition of life imprisonment for murder.\n\n\nPrecedences:\n\nLee v The Queen (1998) 195 CLR 594: Clarified the application of s 60 of the Evidence Act 1995, specifically regarding hearsay evidence.\nVeen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465: Set out principles for imposing the maximum penalty, even in cases where worse examples of the crime might be conceivable.\n\n\nTests:\n\nTest for Compellability under s 18 of the Evidence Act 1995: Whether a witness is compellable depends on factors like the likelihood of harm to the relationship and the balance of fairness.\nApplication of the Proviso in Criminal Appeals (s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act): Whether the error denied the accused a fair chance of acquittal.\n\n\nWords and Phrases Considered:\n\n“Compellable witness” – the statutory ability to require a spouse to testify, subject to certain conditions.\n“Hearsay” – the legal rule regarding the admissibility of out-of-court statements to prove the truth of the matters asserted.\n\n\nArguments by Party:\n\nAppellant (Glasby): Argued that his wife should not have been compelled to testify against him, that the trial judge failed to direct the jury correctly regarding hearsay evidence, and that the jury should have been discharged after Mrs. Glasby’s prejudicial outbursts. He also argued that his life sentence was excessive compared to the sentence imposed on his wife.\nRespondent (Crown): Defended the compellability of Mrs. Glasby under the Evidence Act 1995, justified the cross-examination under s 38, and argued that any trial errors were not fundamental and did not deny Glasby a fair trial. The Crown also defended the life sentence as appropriate given the gravity of the offence.\n\n\nJudicial Opinions:\n\nThe judges concurred that Mrs. Glasby was a compellable witness and that her cross-examination was properly allowed. They acknowledged an error in jury directions regarding hearsay but concluded that the error did not result in a miscarriage of justice.\nThe life sentence was deemed appropriate, and the disparity with Mrs. Glasby’s sentence was justified based on their respective roles in the crime.\n\n\nLegal Reasoning:\n\nThe Court determined that s 18 of the Evidence Act 1995 applied retrospectively and that the trial judge properly exercised discretion in requiring Mrs. Glasby to testify.\nRegarding the hearsay issue, the Court accepted that the trial judge had not provided adequate directions to the jury, but the weight of other evidence meant that this error did not deny Glasby a fair trial.\nThe Court also found that the trial judge’s refusal to discharge the jury was appropriate, given the instructions to disregard the prejudicial comments.\nThe life sentence was upheld as proportionate to Glasby’s culpability.\n\n\nRatio Decidendi:\n\nMrs. Glasby was a compellable witness under the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), and the trial judge’s errors in jury directions did not amount to a miscarriage of justice due to the strength of the evidence against Glasby.\nThe life sentence was appropriate given the premeditated nature of the crime and Glasby’s dominant role.\n\n\nResult:\n\nThe appeal against conviction and sentence was dismissed.\nGlasby’s conviction for murder and life sentence were upheld by the Court.\n\n\nRelevance to Modern Law:\n\nThis case highlights the application of the Evidence Act 1995 in compelling spousal testimony and underscores the impact of Lee v The Queen on the treatment of hearsay evidence in criminal trials. It reinforces the principle that errors in jury directions may not warrant overturning a conviction if the evidence against the accused is overwhelming.\nIt also illustrates the court’s discretion in balancing issues of parity in sentencing between co-offenders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 3: Calling Witnesses / Right to Silence\n\nCalling Witnesses\n\nWitnesses\n\nOne of the main ways that we still adduce evidence in Court is through the calling and questioning of Witness.\nNeed to have an understanding of relevant provisions and case law relating to:\n\nCalling Witnesses\nEffect of not calling evidence\n\n\n\n\nFailure to Give or Call Evidence\n\nHow does the law address the fact that a party fails to call evidence that the party would reasonably be expected to ?\nHow does the law address the situation where the Defendant elects to remain silent at trial ? (This question will be addressed in the next lecture – s 20 EA Silence at Trial)\n\n\nCalling Witnesses\n\nIn a trial, who is responsible for deciding what witnesses will called and by whom ??\n\nGeneral principle is that given our adversarial system, it is the parties to the litigation who decide what witnesses are to be called and in what order.\n\nThis can have a major impact on how a witness may be questioned.\nCan give a huge tactical advantage to one party over another due to limits placed on the manner in which questions can be posed.\n\n\nThe question in criminal matters is who is responsible for deciding who is to be called as a Crown witness ??\n\nNeed to be aware of duties and role of Prosecutor. See Prosecutor’s Duties as set out in Rule 29 Legal Profession Uniform Law Australian Solicitors’ Conduct Rules 2015 [NSW] legislation.nsw.gov.au/view/html/inforce/current/sl-2015-0244#sec.29\n\nMust call evidence that may assist court, even if not helpful to case\nMust be fair case/trial\nMust assist court\nMust not press the prosecution’s case for a conviction beyond a full and firm presentation of that case\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR v Apostilides (1984) 154 CLR 563\n\nApostilides was tried and convicted on four counts of rape.\n\nAt trial P failed to call 2 witness – these witnesses were called by D and cross examined by P (NOT FAVORABLE AT ALL - CAN’T CROSS).\nApostilides appealed on basis that the P should have called the witnesses so D could cross examine them (argued miscarriage of justice).\nAppeal upheld by VSC – retrial ordered (Crown then appealed the VSC decision in HCA)\n\n\nAs part Special Leave Application, HCA set out various propositions including:\n\nThe Prosecutor alone bears the responsibility of deciding whether a person will be called as a witness for the Crown.\nA decision of the Prosecutor not to call a particular person as a witness will only constitute a ground for setting aside a conviction if, when viewed against the conduct of the trial taken as a whole, it is seen to give rise to a miscarriage of justice.\n\n\n\n\nR v Kneebone (1999) 47 NSWLR 450\n\nAnother case where the Crown failed to call a Witness is the case of Kneebone.\nKneebone is authority for the principle that the Crown must meet the obligations that were identified in Apostilides because the Prosecutor is obliged to present the case fairly. This is an important part of the Duties of the Prosecutor.\nCase identifies that although we have an adversarial system of justice, the Prosecutor continues to have an obligation to ensure that a prosecution proceeds fairly.\n\nQuestion of fairness and balance on part of Prosecutor – See also Whitehorn v The Queen (1983) 152 CLR 657 (Deane, J. at 663-664)\n\n\nCrown Prosecutor bears responsibility for deciding whether to call a witness for the Crown.\nJudge may, but not obliged to question Crown regarding reasons not to call a witness. Not called to adjudicate sufficiency of those reasons.\nAt the close of the Crown case, Judge may ask Crown to reconsider the decision, but cannot compel the Crown to call a witness.\nJudge may comment to jury about failure of Crown to call a witness and the effect on the trial (but also now see Dyers v The Queen).\nSave for exceptional circumstances, judge should not call a witness.\nDecision not to call a witness is only a ground to set aside a conviction if, when viewed against conduct of whole trial, it gives rise to a miscarriage of justice.\n\n\n\n\nCan the Judge Call a Witness?\n\nThe issue of whether a Judge can a call a witness was examined in Apostilides where one of the propositions identified by the HCA was that only in extraordinary circumstances should the Judge call a witness on his / her own volition.\n\nIn an adversarial system of litigation, the dispute is supposed to be run by the disputing parties; the judge is not supposed to intervene in the conduct of their cases. However, if the Judge feels that there may be a miscarriage of justice, the Judge is permitted to call a witness (only in extraordinary circumstances).\n\n\nThe authority for the kind of extraordinary circumstances contemplated by the HCA comes from the decision in R v Damic [1982] 2 NSWLR 750.\nR v Damic [1982] 2 NSWLR 750\n\nDamic was a self-represented litigant who had been charged with many offences, including murder.\nTrial Judge thought Damic was fundamentally incapable of leading a proper defence (serious mental illness). Damic refused to raise mental illness as his defence – Judge considered that this did not accord to the principles of a fair trial.\nTrial Judge called a psychiatrist to assess the fitness of Damic to represent himself, and the psychiatrist was then called as a witness to testify about the Damic’s fitness. Had the judge not called that witness, and had Damic been convicted, the conviction would have been unfair and vulnerable to being overturned on appeal.\n\n\n\n\nFailure to Call a Witness\n\nHow does the law address the fact that a party fails to call evidence (witness) that the party would reasonably be expected to ?\n\nThe rule in Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298 relates to civil cases where the Plaintiff does not call a witness that they would reasonably be expected to have called – as a result the Trial Judge may draw an adverse inference from that failure. (Note that s 20 EA only applies to criminal matters)\nThe principle in Jones v Dunkel was originally extended to apply in criminal cases – this position is no longer valid in criminal matters.\nThe application of Jones v Dunkel in criminal matters has been repeatedly overruled, most conclusively in the HCA decision in Dyers.\n\n\nJones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298 (CIVIL)\n\nAlthough Jones v Dunkel was a civil matter in relation to a fatal road accident where the driver of the defendant’s truck was not called to give evidence and does not directly deal with the issue of the accused’s right to silence at trial, per se, the HCA decision in this matter has been cited as an authority for the proposition that in certain circumstances an inference can be drawn from a party’s failure to give or call evidence.\nThe Jones v Dunkel principle says that if a party would normally be expected to call a witness, or adduce other evidence, and they choose not to call that witness / adduce that evidence, in the absence of an explanation for failure to call the witness, a court might be entitled to conclude / infer that the evidence of that witness would not have assisted the party.\nIn light of the wording of s 20 and a several HCA decisions such as Dyers v The Queen, Jones v Dunkel does not have any real application in criminal matters.\n\n\n\n\nFailure to Call Evidence\n\nHow does the law address the fact that the Defence fails to call evidence (witness) that the Defence would reasonably be expected to have called ?\n\nFollowing the HCA decision in Dyers v The Queen, no comment should be made about the failure of the Defence to call a witness who might have been able to assist the Defence case.\nOnly comment that can be made is that the jury should not speculate about what the witness might have said, if he / she had been called (Dyers v The Queen [15] refers)\n\n\nA similar approach is taken with respect to the Accused making the election not to give evidence on his / her own behalf.\nHow does the law address the fact that the Crown fails to call evidence that the Crown would reasonably be expected to have called ?\n\nFollowing decisions such as RPS v The Queen [2000] HCA 3, Dyers v The Queen [2002] HCA 45, Mahmood v WA (2008) 232 CLR 397 and R v Louizos [2009] NSWCCA 71 the position is that where the P has failed to call a witness (who might have been expected to be called by the P), the jury may properly reach conclusions that the failure may help support a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused.\nAs per Criminal Trial Courts Bench Book (NSW)\n\n… a jury is entitled to take into account that there was no evidence from a particular person in deciding whether or not there is a reasonable doubt about the accused’s guilt.\n\n\n\n\nHow does the law address the fact that the Crown fails to call evidence that the Crown would reasonably be expected to have called ?\n\nMahmood v WA (2008) 232 CLR 397, is authority for the proposition that ”… where a witness, who might have been expected to be called and to give evidence on a matter, is not called by the prosecution, the question is not whether the jury may properly reach conclusions about issues of fact but whether, in the circumstances, they should entertain a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused.”\nIn R v Louizos [2009] NSWCCA 71 it was held that ”… it may have been appropriate for the Trial Judge to raise with the jury whether the failure of the Crown to call the witness gave rise to a reasonable doubt about the truthfulness and reliability of the evidence… but he was never asked to do so.” [57]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight to Silence\n\nThe Menu\n\nThe Right to Silence\nSilence of the Accused Pre-Trial\nSilence of the Accused at Trial\n\n\nThe Right to Silence\n\nRight to Silence is a legal protection given to people undergoing police interrogation or at Trial.\nRight is linked with principles that Prosecution bears Burden of Proof and that the Accused is not a compellable witness in his / her own Trial.\nRight covers a number of issues centered around the right to refuse to answer questions – usually relates to avoidance of self-incrimination.\nRight usually includes the provision that adverse comments or inferences cannot be made by the Judge or Jury about the refusal to answer questions before or during a Trial.\nRight extends from the moment of arrest to the end of the Trial.\nDifferent rules apply in relation to Pre-Trial Silence and Silence at Trial\n\n\nPre-Trial Silence\n\nEvidence of Silence (s 89 &amp; s 89A)\n\nIn a Criminal proceeding, s 89 provides that subject to the special requirements set out in s 89A, an unfavourable inference must not be drawn from evidence that a person failed or refused:\n\nto answer one or more questions, or\nto respond to a representation,\n\n\nput to that person by an investigating official, who at that time, was performing functions in connection with the investigation of the commission, or possible commission, of an offence (s 89(1) refers).\nFor a serious indictable offence, s 89A provides unfavourable inferences may be drawn if A failed / refused to mention a fact that A could reasonably have been expected to mention in the circumstances existing at the time, and that is relied on in his / her defence in that proceeding (s 89A(1) refers).\n\nAKA TELL THEM YOUR ALIBI\n\n\nCertain requirements such as a ‘Special Caution’ apply in relation to s 89A.\n\n\n\n\nSilence at Trial\n\nHow does the law address the situation where the Accused elects to remain silent at trial ?\n\nThe Accused has the right to remain silent at trial and put the Prosecution to proof. Consequently he / she may elect not to give evidence or not call evidence on his / her behalf.\nAs set out in s 20 EA, the Prosecution is not permitted to make comment about the Accused’s election not to give evidence. (Raises questions about what ‘comment’ actually means ????)\nUnder s 20(2) the Judge, or other party (not Prosecution), may comment on the Accused’s election but must not make a comment that suggests / infers that the Defendant is guilty of the offence. cf Weissensteiner v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 217\nThis section only applies in criminal proceeding for an indictable offence.\n\n\nEvidence Act s 20 - Comment on failure to give evidence\n\n(1) This section applies only in a criminal proceeding for an indictable offence.\n(2) The Judge or any party (other than the Prosecutor) may comment on a failure of the Defendant to give evidence. However, unless the comment is made by another Defendant in the proceeding, the comment must not suggest that the Defendant failed to give evidence because the defendant was, or believed that he or she was, guilty of the offence concerned.\n(3) ……..\n\n\nWeissensteiner v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 217\n\nFacts: W went on a boat trip with a young couple. Sometime during the trip, the couple dropped out of contact with everyone they knew and stopped drawing upon their bank account. W returned alone, with the boat, and with some of their possessions. When questioned about their whereabouts, he gave conflicting explanations. He was charged with their murder and tried. At his trial, he did not give evidence. The TJ told the jury that, since W was the only person in the world in a position to contradict or deny the Crown case (that he murdered them), and he elected not to do so, the jury could more safely draw an inference of guilt from his decision not to testify.\n\nHCA: Held that this was a permissible comment to make.\n\n\nThe HCA decision in Weissensteiner is at odds with the basis for s 20 – the practical protection the Accused’s right to silence.\n*** Weissensteiner reflected a principle that originated in civil case of Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298.\n\n\nThe enactment of the EA has clarified the limitations on judicial comments about the Accused’s decision not to testify.\n\nWhen examining s 20, the superior courts have said that comments about adverse inferences should be seen as an interference with the right to silence, which is an entrenched and fundamental right.\nIn light of HCA decisions in RPS, Azzopardi and Dyers, it is clear that only in a rare and exceptional case, where the facts would be peculiarly within the knowledge of the Defendant, will the Judge be permitted to make an adverse comment about the Defendant’s failure to give evidence. This is how the HCA reconciled and rehabilitated its decision in Weissensteiner v R (1993) 178 CLR 217.\n\n\nRPS v The Queen (2000) 199 CLR 620\n\nFacts: RPS was on trial for sexual assaults against his daughter between the ages of 4 and 14.\n\nThe evidence against him came from his daughter (complainant) and her mother, to whom RPS had apparently made certain admissions about the sexual assaults.\nRPS elected not to give evidence, which means in effect that he did not deny the evidence against him.\n\n\nHCA: Held that Weissensteiner, and all the cases that relied on it, were no longer applicable.\n\nHCA said that, in a criminal trial, the entire onus is upon the Prosecution, and it will never – or rarely – be reasonable to expect the accused to testify.\nHCA also held that s 20 prohibits the TJ from commenting in any way that suggests the accused is guilty of the offence.\n\n\n*** The following year, in Azzopardi v The Queen (2001) 205 CLR 50, the HCA affirmed this decision.\n\n\nDyers v The Queen (2002) 210 CLR 285\n\nFacts: Dyers was the leader of what the HCA later described as a “cult” called Kenja.\n\nA 13-year-old girl was the daughter of a Kenja member, and the girl attended what was called a “processing session” with Dyers during which she alleges he sexually assaulted her.\nIn his defence, Dyers said he had an alibi. At the time the girl alleges he sexually assaulted her, he said he had an appointment for an “energy conversion” session with a woman called Wendy.\nHe tendered his appointment diary to show that he had an appointment with Wendy at the time. He did not call Wendy.\n\n\nTJ said to the jury: “you are not entitled to speculate on what the witness might have said if the witness had been called”.\n\nAlso said that they were “entitled to draw the inference that the evidence of that witness would not have assisted the party who you have assessed should have called that witness”.\nWent on to say, “you do not have to draw the inference that I have suggested”.\nTJ emphasised that “it is for the Crown to prove [the charge] and to do so beyond reasonable doubt.\nAnd that there is no onus on the accused to prove anything”.\n\n\nThe NSWCCA thought that there was nothing wrong with the TJ’s comments, and that it would have been “abundantly clear” to the jury that Dyers did not have to discharge any onus.\nHCA: Majority held that the TJ’s directions contravened s 20 - quashing the conviction and ordering a re-trial.\n\nMajority stressed that nothing must interfere with the Accused person’s right to silence, nor with the presumption of innocence.\nUnanimously agreed that the accused does not need to give or call any evidence.\n\n\n\n\nIf the Accused does not give evidence at Trial, these directions should be given:\n\n\n\nThe silence of the Accused is not evidence against the Accused (Azzopardi (2001) 205 CLR 50 [51]),\n\n\n\n\nThe silence of the Accused cannot be treated as an admission of guilt (OGD (1997) 45 NSWLR 744, R v Baker [2001] NSWCCA 151, Azzopardi (2001) 205 CLR 50),\n\n\n\n\nThe silence of the Accused cannot be used to fill gaps in the prosecution case (Azzopardi (2001) 205 CLR 50), and\n\n\n\n\nThe silence of the Accused cannot be used as a make-weight in assessing whether the Crown has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt (Azzopardi (2001) 205 CLR 50)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 4: Relevance\n\nRelevance\n\nAdmissibility – A 3 Stage Process\n\nIn assessing the admissibility of evidence the Court undertakes a three stage process where each threshold must be met before moving to the next step:\n\n\n\nRelevant / Not Relevant ?\n\n\n\n\nIf Relevant, are there any Exclusionary Rule that apply ?\n\n\n\n\nIf no Exclusionary Rule applies, should the Trial Judge use Discretion to exclude the evidence ?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon Terms\n\n“Fact in issue def” the principle facts to be proven by the party bearing the burden of proof on a particular issue – facts that need to be proven to win your case\n“Probative value def” means the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue – how important is that evidence when trying to prove that fact ?\n\n\n\n\nThe Concept of Relevance\n\nRelevance\n\nRelevance is the cornerstone of the Rules of Evidence.\nIn terms of Evidence, the concept of Relevance is widely defined and can appear to be rather subjective. (R v Le)\nThe general rule is that the evidence must have some bearing on a fact in issue.\nRelevance does not equate to reliability or credibility – plays no part in testing relevance – test assumes the evidence is reliable (Papakosmas v The Queen)\nMain EA provisions that deal with Relevance are s 55 &amp; s 56. See also s 57 (Provisional Relevance) &amp; s 58 (Inference as to Relevance – relates to relevance of documents etc).\n\n\nEVIDENCE ACT 1995 - SECT 55\n\nRelevant Evidence\n\n(1) The evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is evidence that, if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding.\n(2) In particular, evidence is not taken to be irrelevant only because it relates only to:\n\n(a) the credibility of a witness, or\n(b) the admissibility of other evidence, or\n(c) a failure to adduce evidence.\n\n\n\n\nRelevant evidence to be admissible\n\n(1) Except as otherwise provided by this Act, evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is admissible in the proceeding.\n(2) Evidence that is not relevant in the proceeding is not admissible.\n\n\n\n\nRelevance\n\nThe key concept that underpins s.55 is that there needs to be a logical or rational connection between the evidence and the facts to be proven.\nDefinition requires the minimal logical connection between the evidence and the facts in issue.\nCourt looks at the affect that the evidence could have, if it were accepted.\nWords like “rational” under the Act, do not necessarily mean what we presume them to mean.\n\nWhat is logical or rational to lawyers and judges may bear little relationship to what is logical or rational to lay people\n\n\nWhether logical or rational connection exists is an objective test grounded in human experience. (per Lindgren J Harrington-Smith v WA [2003] FCA 893)\nIndirect connection is sufficient (e.g. Defendant expressed intention to kill victim – sufficient to help the trier of fact better assess whether a fact in issue (intention) is present.\nDoes not need to make a fact ‘probable’, just needs to make it more or less probable than it would be without the evidence (probative value).\n\n– If no impact on probability, material not relevant\n– not a stringent or narrow test\n– only need minimal probative value to satisfy the s 55 test.\n\n\n\n\nRelevance &amp; Use\n\nIn litigation, the ‘evidence’ may be relevant in several ways.\n\nFor example: D told W he robbed a bank.\n\n– It may be important to your case to show that D was involved in a conversation with W – therefore the conversation will be relevant to show that a conversation took place.\n– It may also be important to show what was said in the conversation was actually true – the conversation will be relevant to prove D robbed the bank.\n\n\n\n\nImportant to be able to identify whether the evidence is Relevant, and if so, for what use / uses.\n\n*** One piece of evidence may be used in a number of ways.\n\n– Although there may be a rule of evidence that prohibits one of these uses, the evidence may still be permitted for the other use.\n\n\n\n\nThis becomes especially important when dealing with Hearsay evidence\n\n– eg. the Hearsay rule may be used to exclude the evidence that proves the truth about what was said, but that same conversation may be admissible for the purpose of showing that something was said.\n\n\n\n\nPapakosmas v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 297\n\nFacts: A was convicted of sexually assaulting a colleague at an office Christmas party.\n\nThe complainant alleged that A forced her to have sexual intercourse in a little room away from the party. The issue at trial was consent.\n\n\nThe complainant and three other witnesses gave evidence at trial of her immediate complaints.\nAccording to that evidence, when the complainant returned to the party she saw a colleague. The complainant was crying.\n\nThe colleague asked her what was wrong, and the complainant said that A had raped her.\n\n\nThe colleague took the complainant outside to a table where she repeated to complaint to another woman.\n\nShe was crying and holding her head in her hands and appeared distressed.\nShortly afterwards, the complainant repeated her complaint to a third woman.\nThe third woman gave evidence that the complainant was crying uncontrollably and appeared extremely distressed.\n\n\nIssue – Was the evidence given of the complaint relevant ? If so, for what purpose(s) ??\n\n\n\nIt was relevant to proving the facts asserted by the complainant (that she had not consented).\n\n\n\n\nIt was relevant to supporting the credibility of the complainant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmith v The Queen (2001) 2016 CLR 650\n\nFacts: Smith was indicted in relation to the robbery of two banks.\n\nAppeal against conviction to NSWCCA dismissed.\n\n\nThe fact that the robbery took place was not in issue. Bank security cameras had taken photographs showing what happened.\n\nThe Prosecution’s case that Smith was the person who was shown in the photographs, standing near the back of the automatic teller machine, apparently keeping lookout while the co-offenders took the money.\n\n\nIssue: The only question for determination by the jury was ‘Is Smith the person represented in the photograph?”\n\nThe police knew Smith and identified him as the person in the photographs\n\n\nPolice not eyewitnesses. They were just looking at the photographs. So what made their act of looking relevant? The jurors could also look at the photographs and decide, by comparing the man in the photo with Smith.\nThe Crown argued that because the police already knew Smith, they were better placed than a juror, and that is what makes the police evidence relevant.\nDefence argued that the police were in no better position than the jury in making a comparison between the defendant and the photograph.\n\n\nSmith v The Queen (2001)\n\n[11] Because the witness’s assertion of identity was founded on material no different from the material available to the jury from its own observation, the witness’s assertion that he recognised the appellant is not evidence that could rationally affect the assessment by the jury of the question we have identified.\nThe fact that someone else has reached a conclusion about the identity of the accused and the person in the picture does not provide any logical basis for affecting the jury’s assessment of the probability of the existence of that fact when the conclusion is based only on material that is not different in any substantial way from what is available to the jury.\nHCA majority held that there was nothing about the police evidence that would rationally help a juror in making his / her own assessment of whether the person in the photograph, was the accused or not.\nThe evidence given by police regarding the identity did not satisfy s 55 – therefore not relevant (and therefore not admissible – s 56).\nKirby J (in dissent) held that the evidence given by the police was indirectly relevant as police had seen A in various guises and from various angles and were in a better position to assess if A was the person in photographs.\n\n[45] As a matter of legal policy it is undesirable, and unnecessary in terms of rules of admissibility “otherwise provided by [the] Act”, to set the hurdle of relevance too high. (per Kirby J)\n\n\n\n\nEvans v The Queen [2007] HCA 59\n\nFacts: Evans was on trial for armed robbery at the Strathfield Council Chambers.\n\nThe robber was filmed on security cameras, and was wearing a balaclava, sunglasses and overalls, and said certain words during the robbery.\nDuring his trial, under cross-examination, the Prosecutor made Evans put on a balaclava, sunglasses and overalls, walk around in front of the jury, and say the words that the robber had said during the robbery.\n\n\nAppealed all the way to HCA on several grounds – one of which was relevance. Was it relevant for the jury to see the defendant dressed up like that, walking around like that, and saying those words?\nGummow and Hayne JJ – said not relevant because it only enabled a comparison between the clothing and the security photographs - revealed nothing about the actual wearer.\n\nKirby J – said that the relevance threshold is broad and should not be used to artificially exclude evidence that is, in fact, problematic (and perhaps inadmissible for other reasons).\n\n\nHeydon J (Crennan J agreeing) – said evidence was relevant but did not prove the whole case against Evans.\nShowing a resemblance would assist the juror.\n\nAlso said that, if the evidence showed that Evans didn’t resemble the offender, it would certainly have been relevant for excluding the Evans as the offender.\n\n\n\n\nRelevance Summary\n\nWhat is the material (evidence) relevant to prove?\nDoes it meet the threshold test in s 55 – could it rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue ? If no, material cannot be admissible (s 56)\nNot a high threshold – only minimal probative value needed to satisfy s 55.\nRelevance does not look at issues of reliability or credibility – these issues are dealt with by other provisions.\nMaterial may be relevant for more than one purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 5: Hearsay Exclusionary Rule\n\nHearsay Exclusionary Rule\n\nAn introductory thought !!\n\nThe rule against hearsay has been described by text writers as one of the oldest, most complex, most confusing, most intellectually challenging of the exclusionary rules of evidence, absurdly technical, a conglomeration of inconsistencies, with an unclear definition, an unclear ambit, of bewildering breadth and conceptual complexity, resembling an old-fashioned crazy-quilt made of patches cut from a group of paintings by cubists, futurists and surrealists.\n\n\nDebunking the myths about Hearsay\n\nMany of the problems associated with the use of Hearsay evidence have been done away with since the introduction of Evidence Act.\n\nFor many years there had been calls to rationalise the use of Hearsay evidence throughout the Common Law world – numerous studies undertaking including one conducted by ALRC (which lead to development of EA)\n\n\nMain thing to remember when mastering Hearsay is to understand what it really means and why the Courts treat it with trepidation – this will help shape your thinking and hopefully minimise the confusion.\nIn its most simple form, Hearsay relates to information that was not seen / heard by the Witness that is giving the evidence – they have been told about what happened by another person.\n\neg .   Adam tells Belinda that he had bought a new laptop for his girlfriend, Clare, as a surprise for her birthday.\n\n\nIn this case the only person who really knows the truth of the statement is Adam (the maker of the representation).  Evidence from both Belinda and Claire would be considered Hearsay because they did not see Adam buy the laptop.\nThe reason why this presents a problem for the Court is that Hearsay evidence cannot be tested properly – the Court wants to deal with the best evidence available.\nThe Court does not want to deal with evidence that may have been corrupted or influenced as part of the story telling process – it is unfair !!\nA good example of how the evidence can be corrupted / influenced as part of the story telling process is Chinese Whispers.\nWe need of way of dealing with this type of material to make sure that we do not encounter these types of issues.\nUnder EA, this is the Hearsay Rule and it forms part of the suite of Exclusionary Rules found in Chapter 3 of the Act.\n\n\nThe Hearsay Rule\n\nThe Hearsay Rule is a rule that prevents the use of a previous representation to prove that was intentionally asserted in that representation is actually true.\nIt is important to understand that Hearsay is not a type of evidence.  It is a use of evidence.  Whether evidence of a previous representation is Hearsay depends on the purpose for which the evidence is being used.\n\neg.  A Hearsay purpose arises when someone relates what someone else said, not merely to show that it was said, but to prove a fact they asserted in that representation.

Tried to use this as defence of duress.\n\nTrial Judge held that the comments were hearsay and inadmissible.\nOn appeal, Privy Council held that statement was admissible, but only to show that the statement was made – thereby being enough to scare Subramaniam into doing what he was told.\n\n\nEvidence of a statement made to a witness … may or may not be hearsay.\n\nIt is hearsay and inadmissible when the object [purpose] of the evidence is to establish the truth of what is contained in the statement.\nIt is not hearsay and is admissible when it is proposed to establish by the evidence, not the truth of the statement, but the fact that it was made.\nThe fact that the statement was made, quite apart from its truth, is frequently relevant …\n\n\n\n\nThe Hearsay Rule is set out in s59 EA and similar to the other Exclusionary rules in the Act, it provides a prohibition on the use of the material.\n\nSeveral exceptions to the Hearsay Rule are provided for in Part 3.2 of the Act which details the various circumstances where the Court considers it ‘safe’ to use Hearsay evidence to prove the fact asserted.\nTo be able to properly utilise the Hearsay Rule and the Exceptions need to understand various terms such as:\n\nRepresentation\nPrevious Representation\nMaker of Representation\nFact intended to be asserted\n\n\n\n\nRepresentation\n\nThe EA does not define representation, but in the Dictionary of the Act states that representations include:\n\n(a) an express or implied representation (whether oral or in writing – may also include silence or an action), or\n(b) a representation to be inferred from conduct, or\n(c) a representation not intended by its maker to be communicated to or seen by another person, or\n(d) a representation that for any reason is not communicated.\n\n\nA representation is not confined to a matter which is relevant to the immediate facts in issue; it may include a matter which is relevant to understanding the facts in issue (R v Ambrosoli (2002) 55 NSWLR 603).  eg. motive rather than mens rea\n\n\nPrevious Representation\n\nMeans a representation made otherwise than in the course of giving evidence in the proceeding in which evidence of the representation is sought to be adduced.\nAKA Representation made out of court\n\n\nMaker of Representation\n\nThe person who made previous representation.\nAKA the person who claimed something - Adam from laptop\n\n\nFact Intended to be Asserted\n\nWhat did the Maker of the Representation mean by his / her representation ?\nNot concerned with the actual representation itself – concerned with the fact that the Maker of the Representation intended to assert.  eg.  Bob said the band he saw was ‘cool’\n\n\ns59 The Hearsay Rule-Exclusion of Hearsay Evidence\n\nEvidence of a previous representation made by a person is not admissible to prove the existence of a fact that it can reasonably be supposed that the person intended to assert by the representation.\n(2) Such a fact is in this Part referred to as an asserted fact.\n(2A) For the purposes of determining under subsection (1) whether it can reasonably be supposed that the person intended to assert a particular fact by the representation, the Court may have regard to the circumstances in which the representation was made.\n(3) […]\nNote : Subsection (2A) was inserted as a response to the decision of the Supreme Court of NSW in R v Hannes(2000) 158 FLR 359 .\n\n\nImplied Assertions &amp; Intention\n\nPrior to the amendments to this provision, the Act made no strict reference to implied assertions so following comments by Spigelman CJ in R v Hannes, it was decided to give clearer definition to the term ‘intention’ hence the insertion of ‘reasonably be supposed that the person intended to assert ’ and ss2A.\nThis reinforces the position that under the EA only intended assertions (express or implied) will be subject to the Hearsay Rule (Common Law captured both intended and unintended representations)\n\nSee Walton v The Queen (1989) 166 CLR 283:  where child answered phone and said ‘Hello Daddy’.  Under Common Law this comment was captured by Hearsay Rule – under EA this comment would be considered to be unintentional and would not be subject to s59.\n\n\nSo if the express or implied assertion is unintended then it is not caught by the Hearsay Rule.\n\n\nProcess so far\n\nStep 1 is to identify the ‘previous representation’\nStep 2 is to work out who made the representation. (this becomes important when working out what exceptions to the Hearsay Rule may / may not apply).\nStep 3 is to derive the intention of the Maker in making the representation.  If made unintentionally, it will not be captured by s59.\nStep 4 is to identify the purpose of the evidence.  Is it being adduced to prove the existence of an asserted fact? (Yes = hearsay - s59 applies; No = not hearsay - s59 does not apply).\n\n\n\n\nFirst-Hand and More Remote Hearsay\n\nOverarching aim of EA is to let in as much relevant evidence as possible whilst still ensuring that the evidence is reliable and fair.\nOver the years, some types of ‘problematic’ evidence have been assessed as being potentially reliable if certain criteria are met, or the evidence is handled in a particular manner.\nThis point is true in relation to some forms of Hearsay evidence.  In certain circumstances it may be possible to apply one of the various exceptions to the Hearsay Rule – because they are potentially reliable.\nMain exceptions to the Hearsay rule fall into two categories - ‘First-Hand Hearsay Exceptions’ or ‘More Remote Hearsay Exceptions’.\nEssentially, First-Hand Hearsay is where the previous representation (containing an asserted fact) was made by the Maker in the presence of the person who gives evidence about it (Witness).  See s62\n\nThere is only one degree of separation between the Maker of the Previous Representation and the Witness relating that asserted fact.\n\n\nIf there is a greater degree of separation between the Maker of the Previous Representation and the person giving the evidence (Witness), that is referred to as ‘More Remote Hearsay’.\nThe degree of remoteness becomes important when applying the exceptions under Part 3.2\nUnder s62, there is a requirement that it must be reasonably supposed that the Maker of the Previous Representation has personal knowledge of the asserted fact because of what he / she has seen, heard or otherwise perceived and makes a representation about that fact to the Witness.\n\n\nExamples\n\nMolly says to Wendy that she saw the man with the gun.\n\nWendy’s evidence would be considered First-Hand Hearsay about Molly having seen the man with the gun because it has come directly from the Maker of the previous representation (Molly) who has personal knowledge of the asserted fact.\n\n\nMolly says to Wendy that she saw the man with gun.  Wendy then tells Richard about what Molly told her.\n\nThe giving of this evidence by Richard would be considered More Remote Hearsay because the asserted fact has not come directly from the Maker (Molly) who has personal knowledge of what happened.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 6: Hearsay Evidence\n\nHearsay Evidence\n\nHearsay Revision\n\nThe Hearsay Rule is set out in s 59 EA and similar to the other Exclusionary rules in the Act, it provides a prohibition on the use of the material.\nSeveral exceptions to the Hearsay Rule are provided for in Part 3.2 of the Act which details the various circumstances where the Court considers it ‘safe’ to use Hearsay evidence to prove the fact asserted.\nTo be able to properly utilise the Hearsay Rule and the Exceptions need to understand various terms such as:\n\nPrevious Representation\nMaker of Representation\nFact intended to be asserted\nFirst-hand Hearsay v More Remote Hearsay\n\n\n\n\nFirst Hand and More Remote Hearsay\n\nEssentially, First Hand Hearsay is where the previous representation def (containing an asserted fact) was made by the Maker in the presence of the person who gives evidence about it (Witness).  See s 62\n\nThere is only one degree of separation between the Maker of the representation and the Witness relating that asserted fact.\n\n\nIf there is a greater degree of separation between the Maker of the previous representation and the person giving the evidence (Witness), that is referred to as ‘More Remote Hearsay’.\nThe degree of remoteness becomes important when applying the exceptions under Part 3.2\nUnder s 62, there is a requirement that it must be reasonably supposed that the Maker of the previous representation has personal knowledge of the asserted fact because of what he / she has seen, heard or otherwise perceived and makes a representation about that fact to the Witness.\n\n\n\n\nExceptions to Hearsay Rule\n\nExceptions to Hearsay Rule\n\nSpecific exceptions to the Hearsay Rule include:\n\nFirst-hand hearsay:\n\nCivil proceedings, if maker of representation is not available (s 63)\nCivil proceedings, if maker of representation is available (s 64)\nCriminal proceedings, if maker of representation is not available (s 65)\nCriminal proceedings, if maker of representation is available (s 66)\n\n\n\n\nContemporaneous statements about a person’s health etc (s 66A)\nBusiness records (s 69)\nATSI  traditional laws and customs (s 72)\nUse of evidence in Interlocutory proceedings (s 75)\r\n*** Evidence relevant for a non-hearsay purpose (s 60)\r\n*** Admissions (s 81)\r\n*** Character Evidence (s 110)\n\n\n\nOverview of First Hand Hearsay Exceptions\n\nMaker Availability\n\nDictionary, cl.4 Unavailability of persons\n\n(1) For the purposes of this Act, a person is taken not to be available to give evidence about a fact if:\n\n(a) the person is dead, or\n(b) the person is, for any reason other than the application of section 16 (Competence and compellability: judges and jurors), not competent to give the evidence about the fact, or\n(c) it would be unlawful for the person to give evidence about the fact, or\n(d) a provision of this Act prohibits the evidence being given, or\n(e) all reasonable steps have been taken, by the party seeking to prove the person is not available, to find the person or to secure his or her attendance, but without success, or\n(f) all reasonable steps have been taken, by the party seeking to prove the person is not available, to compel the person to give the evidence, but without success.\n\n\n(2) In all other cases the person is taken to be available to give evidence about the fact.\n\n\n\n\ns 63 Exception to Hearsay Rule\n\ns 63 Civil proceedings, if maker of representation is not available\n\n(1) This section applies in a civil proceeding if a person who made a previous representation is not available to give evidence about an asserted fact.\n\n\n(2) The hearsay rule does not apply to:\n\n(a) evidence of the representation that is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, or\n(b) a document so far as it contains the representation, or another representation to which it is reasonably necessary to refer in order to understand the representation.\n\n\nNote:  Section 67 imposes notice requirements relating to this subsection.\ns 63 provides the lowest threshold for the admissibility of Hearsay Evidence.\nMerely requires that the Witness saw, heard or perceived the representation being made by the Maker.\nIf a party intends to call such evidence to be used for its Hearsay purpose (ie. to prove the asserted fact in the previous representation), that party must conform and provide a Notice to the other party pursuant to s 67 EA.\n\n\n\ns 64 Exception to Hearsay Rule\n\ns 64 Civil proceedings, if maker of representation is available\n\n(2) The hearsay rule does not apply to:\n\n(a) evidence of the representation that is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, or\n(b) a document so far as it contains the representation, or another representation to which it is reasonably necessary to refer in order to understand the representation,\nif it would cause undue expense or undue delay, or would not be reasonably practicable, to call the person who made the representation to give evidence.\n\n\nNote. Section 67 imposes notice requirements relating to this subsection. Section 68 is about objections to notices that relate to this subsection.\n(3) If the person who made the representation has been or is to be called to give evidence, the hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of the representation that is given by:\n\n(a) that person (Maker), or\n(b) a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made.\n\n\n[section continues…]\n\n\nThe effect of s 64 is that it provides the party calling the Hearsay evidence a wide degree of flexibility.\ns 64(2) enables a party to adduce the Hearsay evidence through a Witness if it would cause undue delay or expense, or would be not be reasonably practicable to call the Maker of the previous representation.\n\nThis is very broadly defined and applied and takes into account cost of securing Maker, length of trial, health and location of maker.\n*Requires reasonable written notice of intention to call such evidence (s 67).\n\n\ns 64(3) provides that if the Maker is called to give evidence, either:\n\nThe Maker of the previous representation; or\nA person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the previous representation\n\n\ncan give evidence of the asserted fact.\n\n\ns 65 Exception to Hearsay Rule\n\ns 65 Criminal proceedings, if maker of representation is not available\n\n(2) The Hearsay Rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, if the representation:\n\n(a) was made under a duty to make that representation or to make representations of that kind, or\n(b) was made when or shortly after the asserted fact occurred and in circumstances that make it unlikely that the representation is a fabrication, or\n(c) was made in circumstances that make it highly probable that the representation is reliable, or\n(d) was:\n\n(i) against the interests of the person who made it at the time it was made; and\n(ii) made in circumstances that make it likely that the representation is reliable.\n\n\nNote. s 67 imposes notice requirements relating to this subsection.\n\n\n\n\ns 65(2) imposes more demanding requirements on the Prosecution.\n\nThis is because the evidence will be used against a Defendant who is presumed to be innocent, so there should be greater safeguards in relation to potentially unreliable evidence (not just warning or a discretionary exclusion).\n\n\nFor the Prosecution, it is not enough that the unavailable maker of the representation had personal knowledge of the asserted fact, and that evidence of the representation will be given by a person who saw, heard or perceived the representation being made – the representation must have been made either:\n\nA. Under a duty\nB. Shortly after asserted fact occurred (reduces chance of fabrication)\nC. In circumstances highly probable to be reliable (Conway v The Queen)\nD. Against the interests of the maker.\n\n\n(3) The Hearsay Rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation made in the course of giving evidence in an Australian or overseas proceeding if, in that proceeding, the Defendant in the proceeding to which this section is being applied:\n\nA. cross-examined the person who made the representation about it, or\nB. had a reasonable opportunity to cross-examine the person who made the representation about it.\n\n\n(4) [… Relates to Co-Accused]\n(5) For the purposes of ss(3) and (4), a Defendant is taken to have had a reasonable opportunity to cross-examine a person if the Defendant was not present at a time when the cross-examination of a person might have been conducted but:\t(a) could reasonably have been present at that time, and (b) if present could have cross-examined the person.\n(6) Evidence of the making of a representation to which ss(3) applies may be adduced by producing a transcript, or a recording, of the representation that is authenticated by: (a) the person to whom, or the court or other body to which, the representation was made, or (b) if applicable, the registrar or other proper officer of the court or other body to which the representation was made, or (c) the person or body responsible for producing the transcript or recording.\nUnder ss 65(3) – 65(6)  Statements made in previous court proceedings may be adduced for their Hearsay purpose as long as the Defendant had opportunity to cross-examine in those earlier proceedings.  eg. evidence in committal proceedings being used again at trial.\nPuchalski v R held that what is required is that Defendant cross-examined the person in the earlier proceeding or had a reasonable opportunity to do so – the exception does not rely on nature and extent of cross-examination.\n(8) The Hearsay Rule does not apply to:\n\n(a) evidence of a previous representation adduced by a Defendant if the evidence is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, or\n(b) a document tendered as evidence by a Defendant so far as it contains a previous representation, or another representation to which it is reasonably necessary to refer in order to understand the representation.\n\n\nNote. s 67 imposes notice requirements relating to this subsection.\n(9) If evidence of a previous representation about a matter has been adduced by a Defendant and has been admitted, the hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of another representation about the matter that:\n\n(a) is adduced by another party, and\n(b) is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the other representation being made.\n\n\ns 65(8) imposes are far less demanding threshold for the admission of the asserted fact for its Hearsay purpose, if adduced by the Defendant.\n\nEssentially, this is the same level required under s 63 (Civil – Maker not available:  person who heard / saw/ perceived previous representation can give evidence of the asserted fact.)\nThis is because of the notions of fairness to the Defendant.\n\n\ns 65(8) is designed to promote the admission of exonerating statements of the alleged victim, confessions of 3rd parties and statements of deceased persons.\ns 65(9) provides the Prosecution the ability to ‘reply’ to any material adduced by the Defendant under s 65(8), by adducing its own Hearsay evidence that qualifies or explains the Defendant’s s 65(8) evidence.\n\n\ns 66 Exception to Hearsay Rule\n\ns 66 Criminal proceedings, if maker of representation is available\n\n(2) If that person (Maker) has been or is to be called to give evidence, the Hearsay Rule does not apply to evidence of the representation that is given by:\n\n(a) that person (Maker), or\n(b) a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made,\n\n\nif, when the representation was made, the occurrence of the asserted fact was fresh in the memory of the person who made the representation.\n(2A) In determining whether the occurrence of the asserted fact was fresh in the memory of a person, the Court may take into account all matters that it considers are relevant to the question, including:\n\n(a) the nature of the event concerned, and\n(b) the age and health of the person, and\n(c) the period of time between the occurrence of the asserted fact and the making of the representation.\n\n\nNote. Subsection (2A) was inserted as a response to the decision of the High Court of Australia in Graham v The Queen (1998) 195 CLR 606.\n[section continues…]\n\n\ns 66 provides that in criminal proceedings where the Maker of the previous representation is available and the previous representation is to be used to prove the asserted fact (ie. for its Hearsay purpose) the Maker of the representation must be called to give evidence.\nAs well as limiting the ambit of the exception , s 66 imposes an additional limitation:\n\nthe requirement that the occurrence of the asserted fact be “fresh in the memory” of the Maker of the previous representation - “freshness” is only required in criminal matters.\n\n\nThe “fresh in the memory” requirement in s 66(2) has long been the subject of judicial consideration.\nIn the HCA judgment in Graham v The Queen (1998) 195 CLR 606, the majority held that the term “fresh” meant “recent” or “immediate”  - thereby requiring the statement to be made very soon after the event in question.\n\n“the temporal relationship” required will very likely be measured in hours or days, not, as was the case here (Graham’s case), in years.\n\n\nThis strict temporal requirement held in Graham’s case was considered too limiting and was amended by the insertion of s 66(2A).\ns 66(2A) provides guidance to the Court when determining whether something is  “fresh in the memory”.  Court may now take into account such things as\n\nThe nature of the event concerned; and\nThe age and health of the person; and\nThe period of time between the occurrence of the asserted fact and the representation.\n\n\nAs held in Regina v XY [2010] NSWCCA 181 the temporal relationship between the asserted fact and the making of the representation remains relevant but is in no way determinative of the question. Importantly the court must now take into account the nature of the event concerned.\ns 66(3) provides that the s 66(2) Hearsay exception does not apply to evidence of the previous representation that is adduced by the Prosecution, which:\n\na.   was made for the purpose of indicating what evidence \tthat person would be able to give (called a proof of evidence); and\nb.  deals with matters other than the identity of a person, place or thing.\n\n\n\n\nGraham v The Queen (1998) 195 CLR 606\n\nGraham was a case where the complainant was raped by her father.\n\nIt was 6 years before she told somebody about it, and it was this 6 year delay which the HCA said made her complaint lose its “freshness”.\n\n\nYou might think that being raped by your father would be very memorable, and would remain memorable for more than a few hours or days, and that 6 years later you could probably still have a clear memory of it.\nNevertheless, the HCA did not think so, and this is why there has been an amendment to s 66, directly as a result of the decision in Graham.\n\n\n66A Exception: contemporaneous statements about a person’s health etc\n\ns 66A provides that the Hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation made by a person if the representation was a contemporaneous representation about the person’s health, feelings, sensations, intention, knowledge or state of mind.\nThis means that a person’s physical, mental state or intentions, etc can be inferred by what they say.\n\neg.  The fact that the Sue says to William “I have really bad a headache at the moment” can be adduced by William to prove that fact that Sue did have a headache at that time.\n\n\n\n\nSome Other Hearsay Exceptions\n\nEssentially, under s 69 the Hearsay Rule does not apply to business documents, so that the documents can be used to prove the facts about the business and what is contained in the business document.\n\ns 69 operates together with the rules about proving the contents of documents from ss 48-50.\n\n\nBoth ‘business’ and ‘document’ are very broadly defined, and the rationale here is to save time. It is presumed that business records accurately record the business. If they do not, a party would need to call evidence to prove that.\ns 70 is a similar exception to s 69, and it applies to tags and labels. eg.  it can be presumed that a letter was in fact posted in Wagga on the 8th of June if that is what the postmark says.\ns 71 says that with electronic communications, information about who it came from, who it was sent to, the time and date, will not be caught by the hearsay rule.\ns 72 provides that the hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a representation about the existence or non-existence, or the content, of the traditional laws and customs of an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander group.\ns 75 says that the hearsay rule does not apply in Interlocutory Proceedings if the source of the evidence is adduced.\n\n\n\nOverview of Hearsay Evidence\n\n\n\n\nWeek 7: Witness Credibility / Character Evidence\n\nWitness Credibility\n\nWhat is Credibility ?\n\nCredibility evidence is evidence that deals with honesty / reliability  of the witness and how that can impact on the acceptance of his / her evidence.\nCredibility evidence can be used to strengthen or attack the truthfulness and reliability of the witness or their evidence.\nGeneral premise is that courts are interested in hearing evidence that is reliable, honest and therefore credible. The rules pertaining to credibility are about the quality of the evidence.\nCourts are not interested in hearing about blemishes upon the reputation, history or morality of a witness unless those blemishes could affect the quality of the evidence the witness can give.\nThis type of evidence extends beyond the veracity of the evidence given by the Witness - extends to whether the Witness has the capability to be reliable.\n\n\nWhat is Credibility ?\n\nCredibility evidence could include:\n\nEvidence relating to W’s general honesty, expertise or standing in the community.\nEvidence showing that W has a motive to lie.\nEvidence that shows that W is giving evidence that is either consistent or inconsistent with other statements that W has made.\nEvidence that relates to W’s capacity for accurate observation / recollection.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Credibility ?\n\nWhen looking at credibility evidence two questions need to be asked:\n\nCan we use this evidence to either bolster or attack the credibility of a witness ?\nIf so, under what circumstances is it fair to do so ?\n\n\nCredibility evidence is evidence that helps the Trier of Fact assess the credibility of a witness and therefore may impact on the veracity of the evidence that he / she can give.\nCredibility evidence is commonly referred to as ‘ancillary evidence’ or ‘collateral evidence’ because it has a derived relevance to the facts in issue – relevant because probability of W telling truth may impact on existence of a fact in issue.\n\n\nReasons why you would wish to use credibility evidence.\n\nAs lawyers there are three main ways of using the evidence:\n\n\n\nYou may want to attack the credibility of an opponent’s witness.\n\n\n\n\nYou may want to bolster the credibility of your own witness.\n\n\n\n\nYou may want to attack the credibility of your own witness, for instance, if they are an unfavourable witness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredibility under the Evidence Act\n\nAs defined in EA Dictionary -  credibility of a witness means the credibility of any part, or all, of the evidence of the witness, and includes the witness’s ability to observe or remember facts and events about which the witness has given, is giving, or will give in evidence.\nObviously, credibility evidence is relevant evidence because it affects the probability that the W is telling the truth – this in turn affects the probability of the existence of the facts about which he / she is testifying - collateral evidence.\nUnfortunately, credibility evidence can impact on issues that have no direct bearing on a fact in issue – therefore strict restrictions are placed on its use as evidence (fairness and efficiency).\n\n\nCredibility under the Evidence Act\n\nUnder the EA, credibility is dealt with as part of the Exclusionary Rules within Part 3.7 of the Act.\nSimilar to the other Rules of Exclusion within the Part 3.7, the Credibility Rule (s102 EA) provides a prohibition on evidence used for a particular purpose (in this case a credibility purpose), but then sets out various exceptions to that rule.\nUnder the current amendments to the EA, s102 provides that:\n\nCredibility evidence about a witness is not admissible.\n\n\n\n\nUsing s101A\n\nThe strange and unintended outcomes from HCA decision in Adam v The Queen (2001) 183 ALR 625 resulted in the amendment of s102 and the insertion of s101A in order to make the purpose and application of the Credibility Rule clearer.\nPurpose of s101A is to provide guidance when evidence that is relevant for a credibility purpose will be subject to the Credibility Rule (s102)\n\n\nAdam v The Queen (2001) 183 ALR 625\n\nSako was originally investigated and charged for murdering a police officer but the charge was later withdrawn. He made a statement to the police naming Adam and Sako’s brother as murders.\nSako called by P to give evidence, evidence contrary to police statements and was declared “unfavourable” (s38). P given leave to cross-examine him on his prior inconsistent statement (attack his credibility). Because of Sako’s change of story, his statement to police became inadmissible for its hearsay purpose (no longer first hand). But s60 allows hearsay evidence to be admitted if it is admissible for another purpose.\nPrior to amendments, if evidence was “relevant only” to credibility it would be excluded. In this case, because this evidence was also relevant for a hearsay purpose (by virtue of s60) the HCA said that the Credibility Rule did not apply. This was in effect a loophole in the law.\nHCAs very narrow reading of the old s102 resulted in Sako’s evidence not being subjected to either the hearsay rule or credibility rule – veracity of that evidence was not assessed. Hence s101A amendment.\n\n\nUsing s101A\n\nCredibility evidence, in relation to a witness or other person, is evidence relevant to the credibility of the witness or person that:\n\n(a) is relevant only because it affects the assessment of the credibility of the witness or person, or\n(b) is relevant:\n\n(i) because it affects the assessment of the credibility of the witness or person, and\n(ii) for some other purpose for which it is not admissible, or cannot be used, because of a provision of Parts 3.2 to 3.6.\n\n\n\n\nNotes.\n\n1 Sections 60 and 77 will not affect the application of paragraph (b), because they cannot apply to evidence that is yet to be admitted.\n2 Section 101A was inserted as a response to the decision of the High Court of Australia in Adam v The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 96.\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 101A Pathways\n\nExceptions to Credibility Rule\n\nMany different exceptions to the Credibility Rule.\nSpecific exceptions to the Credibility Rule when:\n\nEvidence is adduced in cross-examination (ss103 &amp; 104)\nEvidence is used for rebut denials (s106)\nEvidence is used to re-establish credibility (s108)\nEvidence of persons with specialised knowledge (s108C)\nEvidence relates character of the accused (s110)\n\n\n\n\nExceptions to Credibility Rule\n\nCross Examination as to Credibility\n\ns103(1) provides that the Credibility Rule does not apply if evidence adduced in cross examination could substantially affect the credibility of witness.\n\n‘Could’ means ‘capable of’ substantially affecting the assessment of the credibility of the witness, as opposed to whether it is likely to do so (R v Shamouil (2006) 66 NSWLR 228).\nR v Lodhi [2006] NSWSC 670 provides guidance on the interpretation of the s103 exception. Whealey J found that the use of the word ‘substantially’ should be given its full import. The test will be satisfied if the credit of the witness cannot be determined adequately without regard to the evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExceptions to Credibility Rule\n\nCross Examination as to Credibility\n\nHigh threshold of admissibility is designed to ensure that W is not open to cross examination on aspects of his / her creditability – unless the cross examination is capable of having a bearing on the assessment of W’s reliability.\nWhen assessing the ‘substantially affect’ threshold, s103(2) provides that the Court is to have regard to:\n\nwhether the evidence tends to prove that the witness knowingly or recklessly made a false statement ; AND\nthe period of time that has elapsed since act / event to which evidence relates, took place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExceptions to Credibility Rule\n\nCross Examination as to Credibility\n\nCross examination is permitted for such things as:\n\nTesting the capacity / opportunity for accurate observation / recollection by Witness.\nTesting bias / motive for Witness to be untruthful.\nExploring previous convictions for dishonesty.\n\n\nUnder s103 EA, also permitted to cross examine about:\n\nPrior Inconsistent Statements\nOccasions where W has failed to tell truth when under an obligation to do so.\n\n\n\n\nExamination of Unfavourable Witness may include cross examination on credibility.\n\n\nExceptions to Credibility Rule\n\nCross Examination as to Credibility of Defendant\n\nIn criminal cases, s104 EA provides further protections in addition to s103 when the Defendant is to be cross examined about his / her credibility.\nPursuant to s104(2) the Defendant cannot be cross examined about his / her credibility without the leave of the Court.\nImportant to note that under s104(3), the Prosecutor does not  require leave if the Defendant is cross examined about:\n\nBias / motive to be untruthful.\nInability for Defendant to recall matter to which his / her evidence relates.\nThe making of a Prior Inconsistent Statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExceptions to Credibility Rule\n\nCross Examination as to Credibility of Defendant\n\nUnder s104(4) leave must not be given to Prosecution for cross-examination of Defendant unless the evidence adduced by the Defendant:\n\n(a) tends to prove that a Prosecution Witness has a tendency to be untruthful, and\n(b) that the evidence is relevant solely or mainly to the Prosecution Witness’s credibility.\n\n\nImportant to remember that s104 must be read in conjunction with s103 when cross examining the Defendant about his / her credibility.\n\n\n\n\nExceptions to Credibility Rule\n\nRebutting Denials\n\nGeneral rule is that allegations denied under cross examination may not be rebutted if the evidence is only relevant to the credibility of the Witness.  In such circumstances:\n\nThe answer given by Witness is final.\nYou are unable to call evidence from another Witness in order to rebut the denial.\n\n\n\n\nCan only rebut these denials if you conform to the requirements set out in s106.\n\n\nExceptions to Credibility Rule\n\nRebutting Denials\n\ns106 (1) states that the Credibility Rule does not apply to evidence that is relevant to a witness’s credibility and that is adduced otherwise than from the witness if:\n\n(a) in cross-examination of the witness:\n\n(i) the substance of the evidence was put to the witness, and\n(ii) the witness denied, or did not admit or agree to, the substance of the evidence, and\n\n\n(b) the court gives leave to adduce the evidence.\n\n\n\n\nRebutting Denials\n\ns106 (2) provides that leave under ss(1)(b) is not required if the evidence tends to prove that the witness:\n\n(a) is biased or has a motive for being untruthful,\n(b) has been convicted of an offence, including an offence against the law of a foreign country,\n(c) has made a prior inconsistent statement,\n(d) is, or was, unable to be aware of matters to which his or her evidence relates,\n(e) has knowingly or recklessly made a false representation while under an obligation, imposed by or under an Australian law or a law of a foreign country, to tell the truth.\n\n\n\n\nRe-establishing Credibility - s108\n\nIf W’s credibility has been impeached during cross examination s108 (1) allows credibility evidence to be led in re-examination about matters that arose during cross examination of W.\nUnder s108(3) the credibility rule does not apply to evidence of a Prior Consistent Statement of Witness if:\n\n(a) evidence of a Prior Inconsistent Statement of the Witness has been admitted - (ie. used to counter the PIS)\n\nOr\n\n\n(b) it is / will be suggested that the evidence given by the Witness has been fabricated, re-constructed, or is the result of suggestion (ie. used to rebut an allegation of recent invention)\n\n\n*** Leave is required if trying to adduce evidence of Prior Consistent Statment under s108(3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7B: Character Evidence\n\nOverview of Character Evidence\n\nCharacter evidence relates to a Defendant’s personal qualities, reputation, or social standing.\nGeneral principle is that the Defendant should not be judged on his character (fairness principle).\nHowever, long been considered that a person’s good character may be able to show that he / she would not commit such an offence.  Therefore rules have developed to allow the Defendant to raise the issue of good character.\nUnder the EA, rules about character evidence apply only in criminal proceedings, and only to the character of the Defendant. (s 109 EA)\nEA provides a way for the Defendant to adduce evidence of his / her good character (or at least an aspect of it) to help support their case.  Leading good character comes with risks !!!\n\n\nRelevance of Character Evidence\n\nCharacter evidence is legally relevant because as Gaudron J puts it in TKWJ v R (2002) 212 CLR 124, 135:\n\n“Evidence of good character is not merely evidence as to credit. It is, in terms used in s 55 of the Evidence Act, evidence that “could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability” that the Defendant committed the offence or offences charged (33).”\n\n\nFor example character evidence could be relevant to show:\n\nthat it is unlikely for a person of good character would commit the offence; or\nthat where the Defendant has given evidence, that they should be assessed as being a creditable witness.  (see Eastman v The Queen (1997) 76 FCR 9)\n\n\n\n\nIssues with Character Evidence\n\nRationale for such a rule is that it helps address the imbalance that may be suffered by the Defendant – only real way for Defendant to put themselves in a positive light.  (Acts as a way of enhancing his / her credibility.)\nProblem is that studies show that a person’s good character is a not a reliable way of predicting whether a person has committed a crime.\n\nThese studies show that perhaps tendency evidence ought to be preferred over character evidence.  Unfortunately, EA has not followed this approach.\n\n\nDanger of Trier of Fact wrongly estimating probative value of character evidence.\nTrier of Fact may also think that the good character of the Defendant should be used to balance against the offence committed.\n\n\ns 110 Evidence About Character of Defendant\n\ns 110(1) EA provides that where the Defendant adduces evidence which proves (directly or indirectly) that he / she is a person of good character, the Hearsay Rule, Opinion Rule, Tendency Rule and Credibility Rule do not apply.  (ie – the evidence will not be excluded by operation of these rules).\nEssentially, s 110 allows the Defendant to call evidence that would be otherwise considered to be inadmissible eg.\n\nDefendant may call a witness who says that she was told that the Defendant does charity work (Hearsay) - without the evidence being excluded under s 59 or having to conform to any of the Hearsay exceptions.\nDefendant may call a witness who says that he thinks the Defendant is a wonderful person and that he is sure the Defendant would not have committed such an offence (Opinion) –\n\nwithout the evidence being excluded under s 76 or having to conform to the requirements of any exceptions to the Opinion Rule (s 78 or s 79).\n\n\n\n\ns 110(1) also provides that the evidence of good character can be general or relate to a specific aspect of the Defendant reputation.\n\nFor example;\n\n“I am a peaceful person who hates all forms of violence.”\n“I have never physically attacked someone, without provocation.”\n“I have never assaulted somebody with anything but my hands – nobody has ever had to go to the hospital.”\n\n\n*** Leading specific aspects of reputation is known as ‘splitting character’\n\n\ns 110(2) provides that where the Defendant has lead evidence of general good character, the Prosecution and / or a Co-Defendant may call evidence that the Defendant is not of good character (generally)\ns 110(3) provides that where the Defendant has lead evidence of good character that relates to a specifical aspect, the Prosecution and / or a Co-Defendant may only call evidence that the Defendant is not of good character in relation to that specific aspect.\n\n\ns 110 Evidence About Character of Defendant\n\n(1) The hearsay rule, the opinion rule, the tendency rule and the credibility rule do not apply to evidence adduced by a defendant to prove (directly or by implication) that the defendant is, either generally or in a particular respect, a person of good character.\n(2) If evidence adduced to prove (directly or by implication) that a defendant is generally a person of good character has been admitted, the hearsay rule, the opinion rule, the tendency rule and the credibility rule do not apply to evidence adduced to prove (directly or by implication) that the defendant is not generally a person of good character.\n(3) If evidence adduced to prove (directly or by implication) that a defendant is a person of good character in a particular respect has been admitted, the hearsay rule, the opinion rule, the tendency rule and the credibility rule do not apply to evidence adduced to prove (directly or by implication) that the defendant is not a person of good character in that respect.\nR v Zurita [2002] NSWCCA 22\n\nThe case of Zurita demonstrates how s 110 is supposed to operate. The TJ had said that character evidence is an “all or nothing matter … either you are a good person or you are not” and that character could not be divided into components. As a result of that ruling the Defendant opted not to raise any good character evidence.\nZurita appealed the TJ’s ruling. The NSWCCA upheld the appeal saying that by preventing Zurita from splitting character, it prevented him from putting before the jury evidence that Zurita had no prior convictions for sex crimes against children.\nIf Zurita was permitted to do so, the Crown would have been limited to attacking Zurita only on the issue of sex crimes against children and not his character generally.\n\n\n\n\ns 112 Leave to Cross Examine about Character\n\ns 112 requires that the Defendant must not be cross-examined about character unless Court grants leave to do so (Leave – s 192).\ns 192(1) provides that the Court may give any leave, permission or direction on such terms as it thinks fit.\ns 192(2) stipulates the minimum factors that must be taken into account by the Court when considering an application for leave.\nThese factors include:\n\nextent of possible effects to length of hearing;\nextent to which granting / denying leave maybe unfair to party or witness;\nImportance of evidence;\nNature of proceedings;\nPossibility of adjourning or making alternative orders\n\n\nStanoevski v The Queen (2001) 202 CLR 115 .\n\nHCA required to consider whether leave should have been granted for P to cross-examine Stanoevski ‘about matter arising out of evidence of’ good character.\nHCA decision in Stanoevski sets out that leave to cross-examine on character should not be granted if there is a chance:\n\nof a miscarriage of justice;\nit would be unfair; or\nit would distract the jury from the real facts in issue.\n\n\nHCA decision in Stanoevski also says that cross-examination on character needs to have sufficient probative value in relation to the facts in issue, in order for leave to be granted under s 192.\n\n\n\n\nAdvance Rulings on Grant of Leave\n\nQuestion of leading evidence of good character (generally or specifically) can have a large impact on conduct of D’s case – if D elects to lead such evidence may open him/herself to forensic disadvantage (usually cross examination of previous criminal history etc).\nUnder s 192A, D may seek an advance ruling to see whether, or not, Court will grant leave to the Crown to cross-examine on character - forensic advantage if D knows the likelihood before he / she elects to lead character evidence.  Court “may” consider giving an advanced ruling – is not bound to give a ruling.\nIn HCA decision in TKWJ v The Queen, it was held that there is no requirement for the TJ to give an advance ruling as to whether, or not, leave to cross-examination on character would be granted.\n\n\nJudicial Comments and Discretions\n\nUse / exclusion of character evidence is subject to Discretionary Rules in Part 3.11 EA.\nJudge may comment that although someone may be of previous good character, there is always a first time for committing an offence – evidence of previous good character should not prevail against evidence of guilt.\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 8: Evidence for Non-Hearsay Purpose / Admissions\n\nEvidence for Non-Hearsay Purpose\n\nHearsay &amp; Multi-Purpose Evidence\n\nA Hearsay purpose arises when a previous representation is made and is used to prove a fact that was intended to be asserted in the previous representation.\n\nSuch a use is prohibited under  s 59.\n\n\nImportant to remember that a single piece of evidence may have more than one use / purpose. For example, one piece evidence may have a hearsay use and credibility use – (as was the case in Papakosmas).\nOther types of exception to the Hearsay Rule exist when dealing with hearsay material that also has a Non-Hearsay purpose.\n\ns 60 exception\ns 81 exception relating to Admissions\n\n\n\n\nSection 60 Exception to the Hearsay Rule\n\nBasically, s 60 provides a way of allowing evidence that has already been admitted for its Non-Hearsay purpose (e.g. Credibility purpose) to then be used for its Hearsay purpose.\ns 60 introduced in order to avoid artificial situation of Jury having to ‘compartmentalise’ the evidence before them ie. “You can use the statement to assess the credibility of the Witness, but you can’t use it to assess the truth of what was said.”\nAs seen in Lee v The Queen and Adam v The Queen  s 60 has been problematic.\n\n\nLee v The Queen (1998) 195 CLR 594\n\nLee convicted of robbing a video shop in Paddington. Crown case was that 2 men entered the video shop, produced a gun and demanded money.\n\nThe shop employee successfully fought them off:\n\nshe hit Lee on the head with a tape dispenser, then jabbed him with the stool she was sitting on.\n\n\n\n\nA short time later, police saw Lee in the street with a man called Calin. They were both arrested.\nCalin questioned by police and made statement about how he had met Lee in the street and talked to Lee about paying back money owed to Calin.\n\nIn police statement Calin also said that Lee looked sweaty and that Lee had told him to go away as he (Lee) had just fired 2 shots and had done a job.\n\n\nCalin called by P and in XIC he failed to adopt his statement regarding what Lee had said about robbery – therefore no longer admissible under First Hand Hearsay exceptions.\n\nLeave granted to XX under  s 38 (Unfavourable Witness) – xx on Prior Inconsistent Statement.\n\n\nHaving had PIS admitted for its Credibility purpose, P then relied on  s 60 so it could be used for its Hearsay Purpose as well.\nTrial Judge and NSWCCA both held that s 60 could be applied.\nHCA unanimously held that  s 60 could not be applied because  s 60 does not make the assertion in the PR true if the witness did not intend to assert that fact.\n\nCalin could not know whether Lee had committed the robbery so the only ‘intention’ that can flow from the Calin representation was that Lee had said these words – not that he had committed the robbery.\n\n\nHCA also raised the question as to whether  s 60 could only be used in relation to First Hand Hearsay.\nResulted in several amendments to  s 60 to rectify confusion that flowed from the HCA approach.\n\n\ns 60 – Hearsay Exception\ns 60 Exception: evidence relevant for a non-hearsay purpose\r\n- (1) \tThe Hearsay Rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is admitted because it is relevant for a purpose other than proof of an asserted fact.\r\n- (2)\tThis section applies whether or not the person who made the representation had personal knowledge of the asserted fact (within the meaning of section 62 (2)).\n\nNote : Subsection (2) was inserted as a response to the decision of the High Court of Australia in Lee v The Queen (1998) 195 CLR 594\r\n- (3)\tHowever, this section does not apply in a criminal proceeding to evidence of an admission. The admission might still be admissible under section 81 as an exception to the hearsay rule if it is “first-hand” hearsay: see section 82.\n\n\ns 60(1) provides the exclusion to the Hearsay Rule.\ns 60(2) amendment provides clear indication that s 60 is not to be limited to First-hand Hearsay only.\r\n-  s 60(2) was inserted in ordered to negate the view expressed by HCA in Lee v The Queen which held that  s 60 could not be applied to Second-hand or More Remote Hearsay.\ns 60(3) was also inserted after Lee v The Queen in order to make clear that in a Criminal matter,  s 60 will not apply to evidence of an Admission.\r\n- However,  s 81 EA may provide an exception to the Hearsay Rule if the evidence of the Admission is ‘first-hand’ evidence.\ns 60 – Hearsay Exception\nAs a result of the amendments made to the s 60 after the HCA decision in Lee v The Queen (1998) and the problems associated with the HCA decision in Adam v The Queen it is clear that the ‘evidence’ must already have been admitted for its Non-Hearsay purpose before  s 60 can become operative. (remember  s 101A requirement regarding Credibility use)\nUsing s 60 (for good rather than evil)\n\nMain use for  s 60 comes about where evidence of previous representations contained in either a Prior Inconsistent Statement (PIS) or a Prior Consistent Statement (PCS) have been admitted for their Credibility purpose and you want to use those previous representations for their Hearsay purpose.\n\nFor PIS – generally rely on either  s 103 or  s 106\nFor PCS – generally rely on  s 108\n\n\nOnce the material has been admitted for its non-hearsay purpose,  s 60 can be applied to allow the evidence relevant for a non-hearsay purpose to be admitted to prove the fact asserted in the previous representation(s).\n\n\n\nAN EXAMPLE OF WHEN  s 60 CAN BE APPLIED\n\nThe s 60 Pathway\n\nSituation\n\nYour Witness has made a Statement to the Police, but in your Examination-in- Chief, he fails to come up to proof (ie he fails to adopt what was said in his Police Statement). How can you use what was said in the Prior Inconsistent Statement (PIS) as evidence of the truth of what was asserted in it ???\n\nMake an application to have your Witness declared an Unfavourable Witness ( s 38).\nSeek leave ( s 192) to ask leading questions of your Witness ( s 42).\nCross examine the Witness on Prior Inconsistent Statement ( s 43).\nAssess under  s 101A:\n\nEvidence has 2 purposes – Credibility and Hearsay but not admissible for its Hearsay purpose (at this point in time).\nCredibility Rule ( s 102) must be applied.\n\n\nAlthough  s 102 applies, can use either  s 103 and  s 106 (Credibility Rule exceptions) to get evidence in for its Credibility purpose.\nOnce the evidence is in for its Credibility purpose,  s 60 may be applied to have the evidence within the PIS used for its Hearsay purpose (subject to any of the Discretionary Rules being applied).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8B: Admissions\n\nPart 1 Definitions: “Admission”\n\nadmission means a previous representation that is:\n\n(a) made by a person who is or becomes a party to a proceeding (including a defendant in a criminal proceeding), and\n(b) adverse to the person’s interest in the outcome of the proceeding.\n\n\n\n\nOverview of Admissions\n\nAdmissions in both Civil and Criminal matters are an important part of the Law of Evidence because Admissions relate to evidence that is favourable to a party who is not actually giving that evidence.\nAdmissions may be in the form of Hearsay evidence or Opinion evidence – therefore liable to exclusion under Hearsay Rule ( s 59) and / or Opinion Rule ( s 76).\n\nSpecial rules developed to ensure they are dealt with fairly.\nRules of admissibility can relate to both Admissions and related representations.\n\n\nAdmissions generally considered to be more reliable than other examples of Hearsay (hence broader acceptance).\n\nRationale for this is that people are far less likely to lie about something that is going to adversely affect their position.\n\n\nGeneral exception to Hearsay Rule and Opinion Rule regarding Admissions is found in  s 81. (Think of  s 81 as another type of exception to the Hearsay Rule).\n\n\ns 81 Hearsay and Opinion Rules: exception for Admissions and related representations\n(1) The Hearsay Rule and the Opinion Rule do not apply to evidence of an Admission.\n(2) The Hearsay Rule and the Opinion Rule do not apply to evidence of a previous representation:\n\n(a) that was made in relation to an Admission at the time the Admission was made, or shortly before or after that time, and\n(b) to which it is reasonably necessary to refer in order to understand the Admission.\n\n\nTypes of Admissions\n\nThere are two broad categories of Admissions:\n\n‘inculpatory’ admissions and\n‘exculpatory’ Admissions.\n\n\nInculpatory Admissions are ones that express or imply something that establishes guilt. Eg.\n\n“I was pissed off with the guy, so I shot him.” (express)\n“He was just asking for it.” (implied)\n“I didn’t complete the job because the account is in arrears.” (express)\n\n\nInculpatory Admissions would include:\n\nConfessions\nAcknowledge a relevant fact that tends to establish guilt / liability\nAcknowledgement of something that goes towards establishing a material fact in issue which Prosecution relies upon.\nAn Admission in a party’s pleadings\nAdopting someone else’s representation as your own\n\n\nExculpatory Admissions more difficult to establish. Exculpatory conduct is conduct that denies something.\n\nWhen you deny guilt, or deny knowledge about something, or deny a fact in issue, that is an exculpatory representation.\nIn itself, this is not “adverse” and therefore not, on its face, an admission. Something more is required to turn it into an admission. This might include:\n\nLying about something, which the Prosecution relies on as proof of consciousness of guilt – ie.\n\nthe Prosecution shows that you are lying, and they argue that the reason you lied is because you know you were guilty.\n\n\neg. saying “I wasn’t at home that night” might be shown, through other evidence to be untrue.\n\nThe Prosecution will then argue that you lied because you were at home engaged in some criminal activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCare needed when trying to equate lying with consciousness of guilt.\n\nMay be other reasons to lie (panic, mistake, to protect others).\nProsecution needs to establish that the lie discloses consciousness of guilt, or deliberate lying, before this kind of exculpatory representation can be used as an admission.\n\n\nIn Edwards v R (1993) 178 CLR 193 Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ held that when dealing with an issue of consciousness of guilt a jury should be instructed that there may be reasons for the telling of a lie apart from the realisation of guilt and, where that is the explanation for the lie, they cannot regard it as an Admission.\nBecause a “representation” can be express or implied, oral or written, and can be inferred from a person’s conduct, the following examples may be construed as Admission by conduct:\n\nRunning away when you see the police.\nFleeing from the jurisdiction.\nChanging your story between arrest and trial.\nNodding in reply to a question can be an Admission by conduct.\n\n\n\n\nExclusionary Rules Relating to Admissions\n\nThere are certain circumstances which will result in the exclusion of an Admission:\n\nEvidence of Admissions that is not first-hand ( s 82)\nUse of Admissions against third parties ( s 83)\nAdmissions influenced by violence and other conduct ( s 84)\nUnreliable Admissions of accused persons ( s 85)\nRecords of oral questioning of accused persons ( s 86)\nFairness Discretion ( s 90)\n\n\n\n\nExclusionary Rules Relating to Admissions\n\nEvidence of Admissions that is not first-hand ( s 82)\n\nUnder  s 82, for  s 81 to operate as an exception to the Hearsay Rule, evidence of the Admission must be first-hand ie.\n\n(a) Evidence must be given by the person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the Admission being made; or\n(b) It is a document in which the Admission is made.\n\n\n\n\nUse of Admissions against third parties ( s 83)\n\ns 83 provides that evidence of an Admission made by one party cannot be used against another party (without the consent of the other party).\neg. Admission by D1 cannot be used against D2, unless D2 consents (Note: D2 is not able to rely on only parts of D1’s Admission – all or nothing)\n\n\nAdmissions influenced by violence and certain other conduct ( s 84)\n\nUnder  s 84(1), for the Admission to be admissible, the Court must be satisfied that the Admission, or the making of the Admission was not influenced by:\n\n(a) Violent, oppressive, inhuman or degrading behaviour towards the person making the Admission or towards another person; or\n(b) A threat of conduct of that kind.\n\n\ns 84(2) requires that the Defendant raise the issue of such behaviour if he / she is going to have the Admission excluded under  s 84(1).\nThe Court must be satisfied that the Admission was not influenced by such conduct, on the balance of probabilities ( s 142).\nWhilst there is no consistent interpretation of what kind of conduct is anticipated here, many judges only tend to admit Admissions if they are clearly ‘voluntary’.\n\nSee Tofilau v The Queen [2007] HCA 39 (HCA speaks of the requirement for ‘voluntariness’.)\n\n\n\n\nUnreliable admissions of accused persons ( s 85)\n\ns 85 deals with possibly unreliable Admissions made to Investigating Officials or persons capable of influencing the Prosecution, by the Defendant.\ns 85(2) provides that the Court needs to be satisfied that the admission was made in circumstances that were not likely to affect the truth of the Admission. (on Balance of Probability)\nThere are particular procedures for dealing with Admissions to police, and s s 85 and 86, together with parts of the Criminal Procedure Act, govern this. A court will need to consider:\n\nthe nature and manner of questioning\nwhether any inducements or threats were made\nany relevant condition or characteristic of the person making the admission (age, education, disability, personality, etc).\n\n\nThe Court will look to all the circumstances in which an admission is made before admitting / excluding it.\n\n\nRecords of oral questioning of accused persons ( s 86)\n\ns 86 only applies to oral Admissions made by Defendant in Criminal proceedings where the Admission was made in response to a question / representation made by an Investigating Official.\ns 86 requires that an alleged documentary record of the Official’s question and Defendant’s response to those questions must be acknowledged by the Defendant as being a true record of the question and response ( s 86(2) refers).\nAcknowledgment must be made by signing, initialling / marking the document ( s 86(3) refers).\nAdditional procedures for dealing with admissions to Police, are set out in Criminal Procedure Act – general rule is that unless Admission to Police is tape recorded, it will not be admissible (see  s 281 Criminal Procedure Act)\n\nElectronically Recoded Interview of a Suspected Person (ERISP)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ns 90 Discretion to Exclude Admissions\ns 90 provides that in a Criminal proceeding, the Court may refuse to admit evidence of an Admission, or refuse to admit the evidence to prove a particular fact, if:\r\n- (a) \tthe evidence is adduced by the Prosecution, and\r\n- (b) \thaving regard to the circumstances in which the admission was \tmade, it would be unfair to a Defendant to use the evidence.\nApplied where Court considers that the Police conduct may have brought about an unreliable Admission – reasons may include: unfairness, impropriety, failure to caution, not voluntary, forensic disadvantage (R v Swaffield: Pavic v The Queen (1998) 192 CLR 159 provides a useful guide although they were Common Law cases).\ns 90 Discretion operates as an additional safeguard to the operation of  s 85 (Unreliable Admissions by Accused) and the Discretionary Rules found in Part 3.11 EA – particularly  s 138).\nProbative value and seriousness of offence not relevant to exercise of  s 90 Discretion (R v Em [2003] NSWCCA 374). In Em v The Queen (2007) 232 CLR 67  s 90 seen as different to  s 138 EA –  s 90 seen as an ‘extra’ safety net.\n\n\n\nWeek 9: Opinion Evidence\n\nOpinion Evidence\n\nOpinion is the medium between knowledge and ignorance.\n\nPlato\n\n\nWhat is Opinion Evidence ?\n\nFrom a legal perspective, an opinion is an inference that can be drawn from observed and communicable facts or data. (Lithgow City Council v Jackson [2011] HCA 36)\nAn opinion is a conclusion that has been drawn, (usually judgmental or debatable), which has been ‘reasoned’ from some type of factual basis.  Opinion should be distinguished from conjecture which has little or no factual basis at all.\nOpinion evidence is evidence of a witness’ opinion that is tendered to prove a fact that was expressed in the opinion, is actually true.\nGenerally, the greater the inference that has to be drawn, the more likely it is for that evidence to be an opinion rather than a fact (Continuum approach – grey areas in-between)\n\n\nProblems with Opinion Evidence\n\nOpinion evidence can be problematic for reasons of both fairness and efficiency.\nOpinions are generally considered to be unhelpful to the trier of fact and tend to be more prejudicial than useful, comprising of merely uninformed speculation.\nOpinion evidence allows the Witness to draw inferences and conclusions – this is the function of the trier of fact.\nPeople can be mistaken in their reasoning process about something that they observed – this can lead them to jump to conclusions based on limited or wrong facts.\n\nPoor / inaccurate reasoning impacts on the reliability and accuracy of the evidence.\n\n\n\n\ns 76 Opinion Rule\n\nOpinion Rule works in a similar fashion to the other Exclusionary Rules with EA – provides an overarching exclusion with various associated exceptions.\nRationale of Opinion Rule is to prevent the use of opinion evidence, where it is tendered to prove the existence of a fact about which the opinion is expressed.\nPursuant to s76, and subject to the various exceptions to the Opinion Rule, evidence of an opinion is not admissible.\ns76 designed to ensure that witnesses give a plain account of what they actually perceived – must not give interpretations, conclusions, beliefs, or opinions about what they perceived.\nWithin the EA, opinion evidence is broadly categorised by the type of witness giving the evidence – this categorisation dictates which of the exceptions to the Opinion Rule may apply.\n\nLay Witness\nExpert Witness\n\n\n\n\nHearsay Evidence of Opinion\n\nSometimes a confusing relationship can exist between Hearsay and Opinion evidence.\nThe way the Act is formulated it is possible for an opinion to be expressed and that opinion be related as Hearsay.\n\neg. “The Specialist told me that the surgery that I require doesn’t have a very good success rate.”\n\n\nImportant to note that Hearsay evidence of an opinion which falls within an exception to the Hearsay rule is still governed by s76.\n\ns76 is not confined to evidence of an opinion given by a witness in court; it also applies to any evidence of an opinion, including out-of-court hearsay representations of an opinion.\n\n\n\n\ns78 Lay Opinion Exception\n\nUnder s78 lay opinion evidence is admissible as long as the following two conditions are met:\n\n(a)\tThat the opinion is based on what the person saw, heard or otherwise perceived about the matter or event; and\n(b)   That evidence of the opinion is necessary to obtain an adequate account or understanding of the person’s perception.\n\n\nGenerally, Lay Witnesses can give evidence about: someone’s age, health, emotional state.  May also give opinion as to estimates of speed and distance, as well as condition of things eg. old, new, damaged, worn etc.  Identification evidence can also fall within the realms of lay opinion.\ns78 requires a rational basis for the opinion before it is admissible. i.e. in R v Panetta (1997) 26 MVR 332 held that there was no rational basis for the opinion evidence given in relation to the exact speed of the car.\n\n\nLithgow City Council v Jackson [2011] HCA 36\n\nJackson moderately intoxicated and after an argument with his GF he left his house to take his dogs for a walk at about 3.30am. Went to local park, walked too close to a retaining wall and fell into drain below. Found about 7am and ambulance called. Case relates to question of Council liability and causation – Jackson argued that retaining wall should have been fenced.\nOpinion / Hearsay question arises from records made at scene by ambulance officer. In section headed “Patient History” appeared the words:\n\n“Found by bystanders — parkland? Fall from 1.5 metres onto concrete\nNo other Hx”. (“Hx” means “history”)\n\n\nAt trial, the statement was excluded as Hearsay and no causation found.  NSWCA overturned decision and held that s78 exception applied therefore causation could be found.  Appealed to HCA.\nHCA majority overturned the decision of the NSWCA. The majority excluded the statement on several grounds including Hearsay and Opinion. Exclusion of this evidence meant that causation could not be established.\n\nHeld that the impugned statement is Hearsay because it is a previous representation being tendered to prove the fact that J had fallen from the wall, thereby resulting in his injury.\n\n\nHeld that s69 Business Record Hearsay exception would not apply because neither the bystander or the ambulance officer had ‘personal knowledge’ of the fall.\nNext question was whether the asserted fact (fall from 1.5m) could be classed as an opinion – held that for it to be viewed as an opinion, there needed to be some personal knowledge held by the Ambo in order to be able to draw an inference (needed to be a factual basis for the opinion).  Therefore the s78 exclusion not applicable.\n\nResult - Ambulance record not able to be admitted under either the Hearsay exceptions or the Opinion exceptions.\n\n\n\n\ns79 Specialised Knowledge Exception\n\ns 79 provides an exception to the Opinion Rule for witnesses who possess some form of specialised knowledge that can assist the trier of fact to understand and contextualise the evidence more appropriately.  This is generally referred to as Expert Evidence.\n\nAs stated by Finkelstein J in Quick v Stoland Pty Ltd (1998) 87 FCR 371:\n\n“The function of an expert is to provide the trier of fact, judge or jury, with an inference which the judge or jury due to the technical nature of the facts is unable to formulate.”\n\n\n\n\n79 Exception: opinions based on specialised knowledge\n\nIf a person has specialised knowledge based on the person’s training, study or experience, the opinion rule does not apply to evidence of an opinion of that person that is wholly or substantially based on that knowledge.\n\n\n\n\ns79 Specialised Knowledge Exception\n\nKey elements of s79(1) are:\n\nMust be some form of specialised knowledge held by the Expert Witness.\nThe specialised knowledge must be based on the Expert’s training, study or experience.\nThe opinion must be wholly or substantially based on that specialised knowledge.\n\n\nProving these elements is mandatory for admissibility of the opinion.\n\nRaises question over what is meant by the term ‘specialised knowledge’ – no definition of term in EA.\n\n\n\n\nMeaning of Specialised Knowledge\n\nApproaches used to define the term have ranged from:\n\nKnowledge which has gained a general acceptance within the relevant professional community (Frye test).\nKnowledge which is sufficiently organised / recognised to be accepted as reliable (Bonython test).\nKnowledge which is reliable by virtue of it being testable, subjected to peer review and generally accepted in scientific community (Daubert indicia).\n\n\nThe test usually applied in NSW is the Frye test.  However the trend in EA jurisdictions is towards a reliability focused approach through the use of the Daubert indicia reasoning.\n\n\nR v Hien Puoc Tang [2006] NSWCCA 167\n\nTang was convicted of one count of robbery when armed with an offensive weapon. The robbery occurred in a convenience store and was videotaped by a surveillance device. The tape showed 3 offenders but was not of sufficient quality to enable clear identification of the offenders.  Two of the offenders were arrested 40 minutes after the offence.\nThe third offender, Tang, came to the attention of the police 8 months after the robbery and was linked to the offence through fingerprints found on some of the stolen goods.\nCrown’s case turned on facial mapping and body mapping evidence from Dr Sutisno who identified points of resemblance between the surveillance images of the third offender and photographs of Tang.\nAt trial, evidence was adduced on the understanding that the Dr Sutisno was an ‘expert’, even though the field of knowledge (‘facial mapping’) had not been subjected to any of the scientific tests for reliability and validity.\nNSWCCA allowed the Appeal on the basis that facial mapping / body mapping, was not shown on the evidence in the trial, to constitute ‘specialised knowledge’ of a character which can support an opinion of identity – therefore the evidence did not satisfy the elements set out in s79 EA.\n\n\nGaining of Specialised Knowledge\n\nImportant to understand that specialised knowledge is not limited to purely academic knowledge.\nA person can also become an expert on a particular thing on the basis of their practical experience. Eg:\n\nAllstate Life Insurance v ANZ (1996): knowledge of investor behaviour and financial markets can be acquired through employment.\n\nIn this case a fund manager was allowed to give expert evidence about investment behaviour but a securities lawyer was not.\n\n\nR v Yildiz (1983) 11 A Crim R 115: knowledge of the attitudes of the Turkish community to homosexuality was considered to be specialised knowledge. The evidence was given by a heterosexual Turkish interpreter who said that the Turkish community regards homosexual people with extreme disfavour.\n\nThe court held that it was not necessary for the interpreter to have actual experience of homosexual people in the Turkish community; it was enough that he knew about Turkish attitudes, through his Turkish birth, nationality, and living his life amongst Turkish people.\n\n\n\n\nAd hoc experience may also satisfy s79 requirements.  A person may become an expert in a one-off instance for some special reason.\n\nIn R v Leung and Wong (1999) 47 NSWLR 405 an interpreter listened to surveillance tapes many, many times. He listened to them so often, and so closely, that he was able to identify features that to an ordinary listener, would be imperceptible.  It was not only that he could understand the languages being spoken on the tapes, he could recognise that some of the voices were of the same people - based on his comparison of their voice modulation, accent, speed of speaking, etc. He was XXed on his methods, and it was held that he could properly testify as an expert in the case.\n\n\n\n\nOpinion based “wholly or substantially” on Specialised Knowledge\n\nThird limb of s79(1) requires that the opinion expressed is based ‘wholly or substantially’ on the Expert’s specialised knowledge.\nRequirement confines Expert to their area of specialisation / expertise. Very common for an Expert to stray outside their own area specialty – needs to be monitored by Counsel and Court.\nThe majority in Dasreef Pty Ltd v Hawchar [2011] HCA 21 said that there needs to be sufficient connection between the opinion and relevant specialised knowledge before s79(1) can be satisfied.\nAlso requires Expert to be able to prove the facts and assumptions upon which opinion is based.  (see Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles (2001) 52 NSWLR 705 and also Schedule 7 of UCPR).\n\n\nProblems with Expert Evidence\n\nExpert evidence can be very powerful evidence because of the so-called ‘white-coat effect’ that Experts can have on juries.\nExpert evidence can be improperly used as a way of legitimising or bolstering poor police work and / or poor advocacy.  This can lead to miscarriages of justice – particular in cases which are largely based on circumstantial evidence. eg.  Chamberlain’s case.\nLack of objective standard against which to measure the opinion: R v Gilfoyle [2001] 2 Cr App R 57; Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles (2001) 52 NSWLR 705\nDanger of jury deferring to the expert: Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles (2001) 52 NSWLR 705\nInability of jury to comprehend the expert evidence: R v Lisoff [1999] NSWCCA 364\n\n\ns 77 Admissibility of Opinions for a Non-Opinion Purpose\n\ns77 is about the collateral use of Opinion evidence.\nUnclear whether s77 operates in the same way as s60.\n\ni.e. where Opinion evidence that would not otherwise fall within the Opinion Rule exceptions, is firstly admitted for its Non-Opinion purpose, it can then be used for its Opinion purpose.\n\n\nThe use of s77 is unclear because there is hardly any useful judicial statement on this section.\n***Because of the confusion and lack of legal explanation around this section it will not be included in the exam.\n\n\nR v Wood [2012] NSWCCA 21\n\nGordon Wood (Chauffeur of Rene Rivkin) was convicted of throwing his girlfriend (Caroline Byrne) of the Gap on 8 Jun 95.\nOriginal trial declared a mistrial because a juror had contacted 2GB with claims of a secret visit to the Gap by the jury.\n\n15 jurors empanelled for 2nd Trial\n\n\nExpert from Sydney Uni (Prof Rod Cross) produced a number of reports for the Prosecution / Police.  He was a Plasma Physicist who said he had experience working with biomechanists – he had been published on the subject.\n\n\nR v Wood\n\nSome confusion as to exactly where the body had been located (Hole A or Hole B).\nEvidence from Cross indicated that it was impossible for a woman of the victim’s weight (61kg) etc, to get necessary take off speed of 4.5m/s if she had jumped.  His testing showed a max of 3.5m/s could be achieved.  His testing further showed that a strong man could throw a 61kg woman at 4.8m/s – thrown like a spear.\nWood was ultimately convicted on the evidence and sentenced to 17 years.\nCross wrote a book about how he helped solve the crime and what a great assistance he had been to the Police.\nAppealed on several grounds – main ground being that the scientific evidence used to convict Wood was flawed.\nNSWCCA very scathing about the evidence given at Trial by Prof. Cross.  Questions over:\n\nQualifications\nTesting regime\nRole in proceedings\n\n\nAlso raised issues relating to the difficulties for jurors in understanding and distinguishing between conflicting evidence as well as the validity and reliability of Expert Evidence.\nWood was acquitted in Feb 2012.\n\n\nR v Morgan [2011] NSWCCA 257\n\nJune 2008 a a sledgehammer-wielding robber broke into the Willoughby Hotel.  A balaclava-clad image was captured on CCTV.\n30 Mins later the same robber breaks into PJ Gallagher’s Pub at Drummoyne.\nConsiderable circumstantial evidence existed that linked Morgan to the robberies (DNA, key to red Audi).  Eye witness evidence as to height was conflicting.\nProsecution led Expert Evidence regarding Body Mapping.  Dr Henneberg (Adelaide Uni) professed expertise in anatomical comparison of images.\nAlthough the Offender in the images was wearing a balaclava, Dr Henneberg said there was a high level of anatomical similarity between the Offender and the Suspect / Accused.\nNo anthropometric measurement or statistical analysis was undertaken by Dr H.  Other Experts gave evidence that Dr H’s evidence was ‘lacking in precise methodology or scientific protocol.’\nNSWCCA held that the evidence given by Dr H should not have been admitted.  The Court expressed concern that ‘there was no scientific evaluation of its validity, reliability and error rates’.  Essentially, Dr H expressed an opinion but there was no factual explanation / basis to support the opinion.\nIt should be noted that this is the same chap who ‘identified’ the nude photographs as being Pauline Hanson !!\n\n\nHoneysett v The Queen [2014] HCA 29\n\nConvicted of armed robbery.  CCTV showed 3 disguised robbers carrying weapons. P called expert anatomist (Prof Henneberg) who gave evidence of similarities of anatomical characteristics between  appellant and a robber in the TV footage. Evidence based on viewing the footage and viewing the appellant in custody.\nPrevious cases had criticised “body mapping” as an area of expertise.  (R v Tang, Morgan v The Queen – which had involved Drs Sutisno and Henneburg) Criticism had been made as to the lack of research into the method of assessing this.\nMindful of this, the Crown did not rely on part of the expert opinion  which said there was ‘a high degree of anatomical similarity’. Confined  Prof H’s evidence to:\n\nCharacteristics of defendant.\nCharacteristics of taped person.\nLack of any dissimilarities between the two.\n\n\nNSWCCA dismissed Honeysett’s appeal on the basis that the expert evidence given by Prof. H was properly admitted, based on his study, training and experience as an anatomist. In the alternative, it said that he was an ‘ad hoc’  expert due to repeated viewings of the footage. (R v Tang [2006] NSWCCA 167)\n\n\nHoneysett v The Queen [2014] HCA 29\n\nOn appeal, the Crown did not argue that body mapping was an area of  expertise, and stuck to ‘anatomy’ as Prof. H’s area of expertise.  It said that he was only giving ‘an account of the characteristics of the body  of the person depicted in each set of images.’ – Circumstantial evidence.\nThe HCA held that his opinion was not based on his knowledge of anatomy, but just on his observations of the tape, dressed up in scientific language.\n\nHis knowledge as an anatomist, that some people have round  heads and some have long heads, was not the basis of the conclusion  that the person in each video had a round head. That was based on his subjective impression of looking at the images.\nThe jury could have ascertained these facts themselves (remember Smith v The Queen)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Expert Evidence Cases\n\nVelevski v The Queen [2002] HCA 4\n\nVelevski’s wife, 6yr old daughter and twin 3 yr old daughters all found in their Wollongong home with their throats cut.\nQuestion raised Defence whether murder / suicide by wife or all murdered by Velevski.\nExpert evidence called to determine whether suicide scenario was possible.\nConvicted largely on circumstantial evidence which was supported by expert evidence from pathologists.\nAppeal to NSWCCA rejected.\nAppealed to HCA on grounds of miscarriage of justice.\nHCA looked at the issue of what constitutes ‘specialised knowledge’ and whether expert witnesses can also give evidence of everyday issues.  Held that:\n\n“Training, study and experience, necessarily include, as they must in all areas of expertise, observations and knowledge about everyday affairs and events, and departures from them.  It will frequently be impossible to divorce entirely these observations …it is the added ingredient of specialised to general that equips the expert.”\n\n\nHCA also looked at question of juries dealing with conflicting expert evidence.\n\n\nR v Keir [2002] NSWCCA 30\n\nSeven small bones found in Accused’s backyard.  Crown argued that bones were those of Accused’s missing wife.\nCrown called expert evidence from Forensic Biologist, Robert Goetz (US Dept of Defence), in relation to matching of DNA profile from bones against samples taken from wife’s parents.\nThe expert witness gave evidence that it was 660,000 times more likely to obtain the DNA profile found in the bones if it came from a child of the missing woman’s parents, rather than from a child of a random mating in the Australian population.\nSignificance of statistical evidence was improperly stated by the trial judge.\nIn his directions, the trial judge (restating the prosecution’s submissions) referred to the DNA evidence as providing a ‘660,000 to one’ chance that the bones were those of the missing woman, and therefore a ‘660,000 to one’ chance that alleged visual identifications of the woman after her disappearance were not correct.\nConviction quashed.  New trial ordered.\n\n\nUniversal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman Licence Holdings Limited\n\nIn a recent Federal Court decision of Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman Licence Holdings Limited, expert witnesses have been urged to maintain their independence and avoid altering their expert reports to suit the needs of the litigants.\nThe trial judge discredited the bulk of the expert evidence given by a computer scientist on the basis that the expert was seriously prepared to compromise his independence and intellectual integrity\nIn cross examination, the expert admitted that his expert report was based on an initial ‘skeleton’ report provided to him by the defendant’s instructing solicitors, and that he agreed to their changes to the technical aspects of his report.\nCourt said that Expert witnesses need to be aware that:\n\ntheir overriding duty is to assist the Court and to be impartial on matters relevant to the experts’ area of expertise;\nthey are not advocates for their instructing solicitors or their clients;\nthey should follow the relevant Court guidelines for expert witnesses;\nthey should not allow their instructing solicitors to influence the content of their report; and\ncare should be taken in communications between themselves as an expert witness, a litigant and its lawyers. Generally, such communication is protected from disclosure until the expert report is served on the other party.\n\n\n\n\nMakita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles [2001] NSWCA 305\n\nMs Sprowles was employed by Makita at its Gladesville office.  She slipped on the stairwell and sued her employer for negligence.\nExpert evidence (Prof Morton) to show that the stairs were too slippery.  Various tests done on coefficient of friction between step and Sprowles’ shoe.\nOther evidence tendered by Makita showing that there had never been any other accident on the stairs.\nIn Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles, the importance of explaining the various methodologies used by expert witnesses and the reasons why they were used were discussed.\nThe Court of Appeal criticised the failure by plaintiff’s expert to explain how he had reached his conclusions, particularly the facts and assumptions underlying the conclusions.\nResulted in the Court of Appeal rejecting the expert’s opinion and overturning a judgment in favour of the plaintiff for more than $1 million.\n“The only conclusion, in my opinion, is that Professor Morton’s opinion about the slipperiness of the steps in the stairway was so clearly wrong that even his impressive qualifications could not rescue it”. Priestley JA\n\n\nKyluk Pty Ltd v Chief Executive, Office of Environment &amp; Heritage [2013] NSWCCA 114\n\nAn Appeal by Kyluk to NSWCCA in relation to an earlier decision of the NSWLEC.\nIn the NSWLEC Kyluk was convicted of a breach of s118A(2) National Parks &amp; Wildlife Act (1974).  Kyluk had pleaded guilty to having picked plants that were part of an Endangered Ecological Community (EEC) – Shale / Sandstone Transition Forest (SSTF).  They had cleared the land to run cattle.\nExpert Evidence from Mr Tulau (Soil Scientist) was considered on voir dire and admitted by the Court.\n\nChief Executive, Office of Environment &amp; Heritage v Kyluk Pty Ltd [2012] NSWLEC 22 (No1)\n\n\nOn Appeal OE&amp;H argued that the Expert Evidence of Mr Tulau should not have been admitted because he had failed to follow Sched 7 – by not properly disclosing all the details (lab results) on which he had based his opinion.\nNSWCCA held that although failure to observe Sched 7 is not fatal, it is relevant when considering whether to apply the Exclusionary Rules under either s135 EA or s137 EA.\nBecause Kyluk were unable to properly explore issues regarding testing procedures and chain of possession NSWCCA held that the probative value of evidence was outweighed by danger of it being unfairly prejudicial to Kyluk.  Matter sent back to LEC for further Hearing.\n\n\nR v Parenzee [2006] SASC 127\n\nAndre Parenzee (HIV +ve) was tried and convicted on 3 counts of endangering human life by exposing others to the risk of infection through unprotected,despite being aware of the transmissibility of HIV.\nAppealed conviction, claiming that the existence and virulence of HIV have not been proven. He was supported by testimony from Valendar Turner and Eleni Papadopulos-Eleopulos.\nA number of prominent researchers, testified to the scientific consensus that HIV exists and is a causal link to AIDS.\nUltimately, the judge rejected the qualifications and testimony of the AIDS dissident witnesses, finding that there is “no longer any genuine scientific dispute” that HIV exists and causes AIDS.  Parenzee’s appeal was denied.\nHis lawyers appealed the case to the Supreme Court of SA, claiming a miscarriage of justice, on the basis that there was no proof that HIV existed, could be sexually transmitted, caused AIDS, or could be tested for.\nAt the hearing, the Parenzee’s lawyers tried to present, Papadopulos-Eleopulos and Turner, as expert witnesses in support of Parenzee’s claims.\nJustice Sulan found that Papadopulos-Eleopulos lacked training and expertise in the field of biology, and had misrepresented the positions of others in her testimony.\nHis finding was that:\n\nMs Papadopulos-Eleopulos has no formal qualifications in medicine, biology, virology, immunology, epidemiology or any other medical disciplines. She has never treated or been directly involved in clinical trials of any kind relating to any disease. Her duties at the Royal Perth Hospital are to test people for sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation.\n\n\nAt the hearing, the Parenzee’s lawyers tried to present, Papadopulos-Eleopulos and Turner, as expert witnesses in support of Parenzee’s claims.\nJustice Sulan also found that:\n\nMs Papadopulos-Eleopulos’ qualifications do not provide her with the academic study required to give opinions on medical and scientific matters unrelated to nuclear physics.” He further noted that she had no practical experience or formal qualifications in virology, epidemiology, electron microscopy, biology or immunology.\n\n\n\n\nR v Wood [2012] NSWCCA 21\n\nGordon Wood (Chauffeur of Rene Rivkin) was convicted of throwing his girlfriend (Caroline Byrne) of the Gap on 8 Jun 95.\nOriginal trial declared a mistrial because a juror had contacted 2GB with claims of a secret visit to the Gap by the jury.\n\n15 jurors empanelled for 2nd Trial\n\n\nExpert from Sydney Uni (Prof Rod Cross) produced a number of reports for the Prosecution / Police.

In contrast, the judgments in Mabo v Queensland (No 2), Love v Commonwealth of Australia; Thoms v Commonwealth of Australia, Walker v New South Wales, and Wik Peoples v Queensland recognize the significance of Indigenous land rights and reject the idea of terra nullius, acknowledging that colonial legal rule has historically marginalized and disadvantaged First Nations Australians. These later judgments suggest a shift towards a more equitable and inclusive legal system.\n\n\n\nPrivy Council = an advisory body to the British monarch and the court of final appeal in the United Kingdom.\n\n\nReception = the implementation of the colonial nation’s laws after occupation.\n\n\nTerra nullius = Latin for land belonging to no one.\n\n\nWestminster system = the British system of representative government, consisting of three arms of government: the courts (judicature), parliament (legislature) and executive.\n\n\nCustomary laws system =  law passed down through the generations by oral tradition (storytelling).\n\nHeterogeneous\nR v Murrell.\n\nMurrell argued that the judgment of the Supreme Court on the alleged murder could not be handed down, as judgment could only be handed down by Jabbingee’s family.\nNew South Wales was neither conquered, ceded, nor a British settlement by occupation. Thus, the Aboriginal people were not bound by English criminal laws in New South Wales. Only the Britons were bound by these laws. The sole exception was where laws ‘protected’ Aboriginal people—this was premised on a contract theory of government: that the right to govern and impose laws on the people was granted in return for their protection.\n•Aboriginal people had no recognisable laws, but only ‘practices’ that ‘are consistent with a state of the grossest darkness and irrational superstition’. These ‘are founded entirely upon principles … of vindication for personal wrongs’ and ‘the wildest most indiscriminatory notions of revenge’. Thus, Aboriginal people are not ‘entitled to be recognised as … sovereign states governed by laws of their own’.\nEvery First Nations person born in Australia after 1829 became a British subject—although not by their own choosing, or necessarily to their benefit (R v Murrell\n\n\n\n\n\nNative title\n\nLaw Reform Commission of Western Australia identified among Western Australian First Nations societies ‘a defined system of rules for the regulation of human behaviour which has developed over many years from a foundation of moral norms and which attracts specific sanctions for noncompliance’.\n\n\n\nOccupation\n\nit allowed for the automatic reception of English laws, without the need to negotiate a treaty and concede limitations on colonial jurisdiction. The logic behind occupation is that the colonised territory does not have a pre-existing legal system that the colonising nation has to adopt or negotiate with.\nToo primitive to own land, so they were the only land owners in the area\n\nNeeded to show land development and cultivation\n\n\n\n\n\nThe international law doctrine of terra nullius—a colony ‘without settled inhabitants or settled

Anglo-Australian laws\n\n\nWalker v New South Wales in 1994\n\nHigh Court held that the jurisdiction of the Anglo-Australian criminal law could not be challenged by First Nations laws\nThe judgment in R v Bonjon (see above) is an example of New South Wales Supreme Court Judge Willis’ refusal to accept the universality of English laws.\n\n\n\nGovernor Bourke issued a proclamation that the British Crown was the owner of all Australian territory and solely capable of distributing the land, which the British Colonial Office affirmed on 10 October 1835.\n\n\nThe Australian Courts Act 1828 (UK) was the statutory instrument for the formal reception of English law.\n\nPursuant to the Imperial Acts Application Act 1969 (NSW), English laws received in 1828 were deemed to be specifically applicable to the colony of New South Wales upon settlement\n\n\n\nCriminal and civil courts were established in 1788 pursuant to the New South Wales Courts Act 1787 (UK) and letters patent from the King dated 2

will we proceed with force against him, or send others to do so, except by the lawful judgment of his equals or by the law of the land.\nTo no one will we sell, to no one deny or delay right or justice.\n\nin the fourteenth century, the English Parliament saw it as guaranteeing trial by jury.\nFoundation of modern bills of rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe principles that the Anglo-Australian legal system adopted from England can be summarised in 20 key concepts:\n\nFeudalism-\n\nThe legal obligations to the ruler were formalized with the Norman Conquest in 1066, when William, Duke of Normandy, was crowned King William I and assumed ultimate title to all land in England.\n\nThis system developed in England and formed the basis of its land law, criminal legal system and taxation system.\nIt also forms the basis of Australian law in these areas—the Crown ultimately owns all the land, our criminal system is based on an action by the state against the wrongdoer, and there is an entrenched power for the government to impose taxes.\n\n\n\n\nLaw as an autonomous discipline\nCommon law legal system\nPrecedent\n\ndoctrine of precedent requires that the decisions of a court on a matter of law are binding on all courts that are lower in the judicial hierarchy.\n\n\nEquity\n\nChecks and balances on courts\nThe Judicature Acts\n\nActs consolidated the various common law courts (which required the filing of writs based on standard forms that were rigid and would give rise to injustice when parties could not comply) and equity courts (which had more flexibility and usually fairness in their procedure).\nThe equity and common law courts came together to form one general court, known as the Supreme Court of Judicature (with different divisions),36 to create uniformity in pleading and procedure.\n\nSupreme Court Act 1970\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue process\nJuries\n\nToday, a jury usually consists of 12 people in a criminal trial and between four and twelve people in a civil trial,\nIn civil cases, the jury must make a decision as to liability and may also determine the amount of damages awarded\n\n\nRule of law\n\ngovernment should rule through law, and not through the

considered dicta of the majority of the High Court.\n\n\n\n\n\nRules of law derived from cases are not in fixed verbal form\n\nWording on common law might be similar, but different judges apply it slightly differently\nDoctrine of precedent rules\n\neach court is bound by decisions of courts higher in its hierarchy;\na decision of a court in a different hierarchy or lower in the same hierarchy may be persuasive but not binding;\na court is not bound by its own pastd ecisions but will depart from them with reluctance;\nOnly the ratio decidendi (the reason for the decision) of a case is binding\nobiter dicta (remarks in passing)are not considered binding but may be persuasive;\nprecedents do not lose their force by lapse of time; and\nprevious court decisions only apply to the legal principles used to make the decision (ratio decidendi), not to the factual findings made by the court.\n\nAdditionally, a lower court is not bound by the factual findings of a higher court, especially in a different case.\n\n\nKinsella v Solicitorforthe Northern Territ\noften creates conflicts between two important goals.\n\nOn the one hand, people want a final and clear outcome to their legal disputes, so they know where they stand.\nOn the other hand, people want to make sure that justice is served in each individual case\n\nwhich may not always be the same as past decisions.\n\n\n\n\noccupier’s liability\n\nthe liability, generally upon the occupier rather than the owner, to compensate persons injured on premises, owing to their dangerous state\n\n\n\n\nRatio decidendi\n\nThis can be expressed by saying that the doctrine of precedent will view as a ratio only a ruling on a point of law rather than a statement of a rule of law•.\n\n\nLEVEL OF GENERALITY\n\nCases that are worded to apply only to the specific facts of that case are of limited precedential value\n\nwhile restating a rule at a higher level of generality allows it to encompass a wider range of factual circumstances and increases its value as a precedent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrecedent and Change\n\nDorset Yacht Co Ltd v Home Office\nprevious cases had not usually allowed a duty of care in negligence to arise in such circumstances—where the defendant was a public authority,\n\nwhere the damage was caused not directly by the defendant but by a third party’s voluntary action.\n\n\nNatural law is broadly a belief in a system of law common to all people\n\nderived from the supreme force in the universe, or God.\n\n\npositivism in law,\nbroadly, is a belief in a system of law created by men.\n\nSuch law is recognisable by its pedigree or how it was created\nrather than whether it is right or wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\nBugmy v R (2013)\n\nCause of Appeal\n\nDirector of Public Prosecutions appealed the case on the grounds that the sentence was inadequate\nTwo key legal issues - Ratio\n\nAn appellate court cannot adjust a sentence unless it first makes an explicit finding that the original sentence was manifestly inadequate.\nSentencing factors should relate to the individual offender, be it Aboriginal or non-Aboriginal —\n\ngeneric and systemic factors such as incarceration statistics are not relied upon.\nIn sentencing, full weight should be given to an offender’s deprived background, regardless of the intervening years and offences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaws violated\n\nSection 60A(1) makes it an offence to assault a correctional officer while the officer is acting in the execution of his or her duty.\nSection 33(1)(b) makes it an offence to cause grievous bodily harm to a person with intent to cause harm of that kind.\n\n\nFacts\n\nCriminal background - in and out of prison since 13 to 29\nMental impairment\n\nCaused court to reconsider his sentence due to personal circumstances\n\n\nTook Fernando considerations into account\n\nraised in an Aboriginal community with alcohol abuse and violence\nFernando was intoxicated at the time\nIf raised in a community like this, the offender’s moral culpability is likely less than those whose formative years were better\n\n\nCourts are waiting for legislative to fix natives incarcerated\nWood J proposed that being unfamilkiar with European ways would make a lengthy term particularly burdensome\nthe appellant’s submission that courts should take judicial notice of the systemic background of deprivation of Aboriginal offenders cannot be accepted\n\n\nDirector’s issues\n\n‘Ground 1: failed to determine the degree of the offence.\nGround 2: failed to acknowledge the victim as a serving prison officer performing his duties.\nGround 3: Judge weighed the facts of the case too leniently.’\n\nThe appellant argued that the three additional grounds were just details of the main issue of manifest inadequacy.\nThe Director didn’t argue otherwise but said that the errors found were like manifest inadequacy.\nThe problem is that the Court of Criminal Appeal either found manifest inadequacy or not.\n\nThe Court’s holding said that they didn’t need to address the issue of manifest inadequacy because the errors identified required a resentencing.\nThis contradicts the argument that there was an implicit finding of manifest inadequacy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\nCourt of Criminal Appeal disagreed with the sentence imposed by Judge Lerve and favoured a more severe sentence.\nAppeals said that Judge Lerve gave too much weight to fernando in this case\nMust not treat aboriginal offenders different, if so, individual justice is meaningless\nBrennan J in Neal v The Queen [(1982) 149 CLR 305],\n\nthe weight to be afforded to the effects of social deprivation in an offender’s youth and background is in each case for individual assessment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment initiatives in customary sentencing\n\nCircle sentencing (NSW)\n\ncommunity elders, the victim (if they choose), the offender and their lawyer, family members of the offender and victim, the

about twenty minutes, refusing to come down when requested to do so by the police.\nIf the statue were in fact defiled or abused, then strong feelings of resentment might well have been calculated to arise\nThere is no criticism by the Crown of that political protest or demonstration as such. I have found as facts that: (a) the climbing on the pedestal of the statue and the hanging of the placard from part of the statue were an unpremeditated part of the political protest; (b) the conduct was not a student’s prank or joke or stunt, but was originally undertaken in an incidental fashion as a means—even if a peculiar means—of drawing wider public attention to the protest.\nSergeant resentment was of silly conduct, a normal reaction\n\n\n\nState the issue raised by the material facts\n\nLaw(s)/Statue(s) in contention\n\nPolice Offences Ordinance 1930 (ACT), s 17(d), with behaving in an offensive manner in a public place and convicted.\n\nSection 17 (d) of the Police Offences Ordinance says: “Any person who, in or near any public place, or within the view or hearing of any person therein behaves in a threatening, abusive, offensive or insulting manner, shall be guilty of an offense”\n\n\n\n\nPrecedences\n\nAnderson v.

Section 12: Defines a “security interest” as an interest in personal property provided for by a transaction that, in substance, secures payment or performance of an obligation.\n\n\n\n\nCreation of a Security Interest\n\n\nTransaction Involvement: A transaction must occur involving personal property where the interest is meant to secure payment or an obligation.\n\n\n\n\nAttachment of Security Interest\n\n\nPPSA, Section 19: Specifies the conditions under which a security interest attaches to the collateral.\nCriteria for Attachment:\n\nThe debtor must have rights in the collateral.\nValue must be given (by the secured party).\nSecurity agreement must be enforceable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRights in Collateral\n\n\nPossession and Proprietary Rights: As in Re Maiden Civil, the lessee (debtor) obtains proprietary rights in the goods upon taking possession under a PPS lease.\n\n\n\n\nPerfection of Security Interest\n\n\nPPSA, Section 21: Perfection can be achieved through registration on the PPS Register or by possession of the collateral.\nImportance of Perfection: Protects the security interest from claims by third parties and is crucial in bankruptcy or insolvency scenarios.\n\n\n\n\nPriority of Security Interests\n\n\nGeneral Rule: Perfected security interests have priority over unperfected security interests.\nCompeting Interests: The first to perfect or the first to register typically has priority.\n\n\n\n\nEffect of Non-Perfection\n\n\nPPSA, Section 267: Unperfected security interests may vest in the grantor (debtor) if they go into administration or bankruptcy, as was a key issue in Re Maiden Civil.\n\n\n\n\nEnforcement of Security Interests\n\n\nRights of Secured Parties: Upon default, secured parties may seize or otherwise enforce their rights in the collateral as per the terms of the security agreement and PPSA provisions.\n\n\n\n\nBankruptcy and Insolvency\n\n\nImpact on Security Interests: The status of security interests during the debtor’s bankruptcy or insolvency can determine the recovery of secured parties, highlighting the importance of timely registration and perfection.\n\n\n\n\nCase Application\n\n\nExample from Re Maiden Civil: Maiden Civil’s receivers, appointed by a secured party with a perfected interest, successfully claimed the caterpillars over the unperfected interest of QES, showcasing the practical

History of the Australian Consumer Law\r\n○ The Australian Consumer Law (ACL) is a comprehensive regime to provide protection to consumers:\r\n○ The ACL is comprehensive package of consumer protection provisions which includes:\r\n○ The ACL applies nationally and in all States and Territories, and to all Australian businesses.\r\n○ The ACL is not intended to cover the field:\r\n○ In addition to the legislation protections under the ACL, Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW) and limited provisions of the Sale of Goods Acts, consumers can seek remedies under common law, or combinations of both common law and legislation to obtain redress.\r\n● Scope of the ACL\r\n○ Chapter 1 – Introduction:\r\n○ Chapter 2 – General protections,\r\n○ Chapter 3 – Specific protections which address identified forms of business conduct, including provisions:\r\n○ Chapter 4 – Offences:\r\n○ Chapter 5 – Enforcement and Remedies\r\n● Regulations under the ACL\r\n○ Regulations made under the ACL are set out in Parts 6 and 7 of the Competition and Consumer Regulations 2010 (Cth)\r\n○ The ACL Regulations give practical effect to the ACL provisions dealing with:\r\n● Overview of the Consumer Guarantee Law in the ACL\r\n○ The Consumer Guarantee Law is found in Parts 3-2, Div 1, and available remedies in Part 5-4 of the ACL.\r\n○ Provides minimum mandatory standards of quality of goods and services to “consumers” under s 3(1).\r\n○ Does not apply to financial products and services under ACL and in fact not in the ASIC Act for these goods or services.\r\n○ These are statutory rights and remedies, not implied terms into the contract as under the Sale of Goods Act.\r\n● Rationale for the Consumer Guarantee Law\r\n○ These standards were inserted to address the “information asymmetry” (see TradePractices Amendment (Australian Consumer Law) Bill (No 2) 2010, Explanatory Memorandum, p 607), between consumers and suppliers, given that consumers will ordinarily:\r\n○ Key Definition: Meaning of ‘consumer’\r\n● Tarangau Game Fishing Charters Pty Ltd v Eagle Yachts Pty Ltd [2017] QSC 306\r\n○ In July 2006 Tarangau purchased a yacht from the defendant.\r\n○ Held:\r\n○ Plaintiff not a

Ltd v Chan (1987) ASC ¶55-553\r\n○ Guarantees in respect of goods\r\n● SS 54-59 – limited to supplying goods ‘in trade or commerce’ s 2\r\n○ ACL section 2 defines ‘trade or commerce’ as follows:\r\n○ The “in trade or commerce” limitation\r\n○ Qualifications to s 54\r\n● Guarantee – Fitness for Purpose (s 55)\r\n○ Section 55 provides for a guarantee that the goods supplied to a consumer are reasonably fit for any disclosed purpose, and for any purpose for which the supplier represents that they are reasonably fit.\r\n● Breach of guarantees as to acceptable quality and fitness for purpose:\r\n○ Vautin v BY Winddown Inc (formerly Bertram Yachts) (no 4) [2018] FCA 426\r\n● Fitness for disclosed purpose\r\n○ Cavalier Marketing (Australia) Pty Ltd v Rasell (1987) ASC ¶55-553\r\n○

warranties (s 59)\r\n● C: Guarantees in respect of services\r\n○ The Sale of Goods Act does not deal with “services” at all.\r\n○ Guarantees in relation to supply of services ss 60-62\r\n○ Guarantee as to services\r\n○ Guarantee as to services\r\n● Guarantees generally not excluded by contract\r\n○ Most of the guarantees are mandatory and cannot be excluded by contract.\r\n○ Any attempt to exclude will be void and may also be misleading and deceptive:\r\n○ However some exceptions:\r\n● Enforcement and Remedies\r\n○ This part looks at Part 5-4, Divisions 1 and 2 which afford consumers remedies against the supplier or the manufacturer for failure to comply with guarantees as to good and/or services.\r\n○ Remedies and Enforcement Part 5-4 Div 1 Actions against Suppliers\r\n○ Remedies and Enforcement Part 5-4\r\n○ Remedies and Enforcement Part 5-4 Div 2\r\n○ Indemnification of suppliers by manufacturers\r\n● Product Liability – Part 3-5 ACL\r\n○ This final part looks briefly at Part 3-5 of the ACL which is based on the former Part VA of the Trade Practices Act to provide remedies against manufacturers and importers of defective goods.\r\n○ An action can be brought against a manufacturer in respect of unsafe goods giving rise to:\r\n○ Product liability general principles\r\n○ Manufacturers Defences s 142 - Defences to defective goods action\r\n○ Ryan v Great Lakes Council

Deceptive Conduct\r\n○ The general prohibition against misleading and deceptive conduct and conduct likely to mislead or deceive under s 18(1) of the ACL derives from the former s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).\r\n○ Section 18 - Misleading or Deceptive Conduct\r\n○ The broad reach of Section 18\r\n○ The relevant audience\r\n○ What conduct may be misleading?\r\n● Unconscionable

501\n\n\nChattel Mortgage def\n\nA chattel mortgage refers to a finance agreement that provides funds to purchase goods.\nIn such an interest, the security for the lender (mortgagee) involves the passing of title in the property to the mortgagee from the borrower (mortgagor): Palgo Holdings Pty Ltd v Gowans (2005) 221 CLR 249; [2005] HCA 28\n\n\nPledge def\n\nA pledge is a form of bailment.\nThe debtor/ pledgor gives possession of property owned by the debtor to a creditor (the pledgee) to secure a debt or other obligation.\nEx parte Official Receiver in re Morritt (1886) 18 QBD 222\n\n\nCharge def\n\nA charge has been described as “the appropriation of real or personal property for the discharge of a debt or another obligation, without giving the creditor either a general or special property in or possession of the subject of the security.”: Fisher and Lightwood (2005) at [1.6]\nIt is a common law security interest held by a lender over the personal property of a company.\nThe charge is pursuant to agreement where the the interest is given by the owner (the chargor) to the lender (the chargee) to secure payment of a debt or obligation.\nA charge creates a contractual right to enforce the security interest upon the happening of an event, such as default or insolvency by creating a right to get a court order for sale of the property.\nThe charge can be described as “fixed” over identified property or “floating” in the sense that it floats over assets such as trading stock that the business is free to use until an event triggers its crystalising.\n\n\nFixed Charge def\n\nA fixed charge attaches to specific and identified assets of the company.\nThe chargor retains ownership of the assets however, if the chargor defaults in repayments or its obligations, the chargee can enforce payment of the loan through its rights of sale and use of the proceeds of the sale of the asset.\n\n\nFloating charge def\n\nA floating charge ‘floats’ over all company assets, present or future, or certain categories of assets.\nThe assets are non-specific in that they may change over the duration of the charge, for example, stock in trade or accounts receivable.\nThe company may use the assets in its business and it only becomes fixed in the event of a triggering event such as default in payment.\n\n\nLien def\n\nA lien is “a right conferred by law upon a person to retain possession of or to have a charge upon the real or personal property of another until certain demands are satisfied”: Fisher and Lightwood (2005) at [1.10]\nA lien is functionally like a charge except that it does not arise by agreement for value but by operation of law.\n\n\n\n\nEight Principles of Commercial Law\n\nParty autonomy\n\nA party is entitled to the benefit of his bargain and to the strict performance of conditions of the contract, whether they relate to the time of performance or the description or quality of what is to be tendered as performance.\nOnly where contract terms are so restrictive, oppressive or otherwise incompatible with society’s goals as to offend against the public interest should the courts intervene to curb the sanctity of contract\nCaveat emptor\n\n\nPredictability\n\nA reasonable degree of predictability is needed in the commercial world because so much planning and so many transactions, standardised or high in value, are undertaken on the basis that the courts will continue to follow the rules laid down in preceding cases.\n\n\nFlexibility\n\nBusiness requires that law accommodate new practices and developments on the other.\n\n\nGood faith\n\nIn civil law jurisdictions the duty of good faith is inherent not only in contractual but in pre-contractual relationships.\n\n\nThe encouragement of self-help\n\nAcceleration clauses can be invoked, contracts can be terminated or rescinded, goods repossessed, liens and rights of contractual set-off exercised, receivers and managers appointed and securities realised, all without any need for judicial approval, the only limiting factor (in the absence of special legislation) being that one must not commit a breach of the peace.\n\n\nThe facilitation of security interests\n\nMore favorable than Civil Law\nSecurity can be taken over almost any kind of asset, tangible or intangible, usually with little or no formality; it can cover present and future property without the need for specific description; and it can secure present and future indebtedness.\n\n\nThe protection of vested rights\n\na general feeling that an owner should not lose his property without fault;\n\n\nThe protection of innocent third parties.\n\nthat innocent buyers (including incumberancers) should be protected against proprietary rights of which they have no notice, in order to ensure the free flow of goods in the stream of trade.\n\n\n\n\nThe Nature of Personal Property\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\npersonal property def\n\n“comprises all recognised types of property other than “real property” (land)\nIncludes intangible property (eg, rights, such as intellectual property)\n\n\nIntroduction: Some Theses on Property\n\n\n\nProperty is that which is owned.\n\n\n\n\nStates extend their possessions in the same way as individuals; so do tribes and communities.\n\n\n\n\nThe distinction between private ownership and public ownership is not central or even important for a general theory of ownership, or for a discussion of many of its social effects.\n\n\n\n\nAll ownership, and therefore all property, is in an important sense private or privatising.\n\n\n\n\nIn discussing the core meaning of the concept of ownership or of property, it is not useful to import differences between different types of owners or changes in some of the social functions and importance of property in the core concept of property itself.\n\n\n\n\nIn all societies, there are things that are owned, that constitute property that is in our sense private, and things that are not.\n\n\n\n\nThere are no natural eternal necessities in the matter of the scope of ownership, although the physical capacity to control may vary over time as a result of both technological and political change.\n\n\n\n\nThere are and there have been no enduring social owners or rules whose power over their property is logically absolute.\n\n\n\n\nIn law and social life, ownership is a burden as well as a privilege, a responsibility as well as an advantage.\n\n\n\n\nThe rights and powers conferred by ownership are not and never have been indefeasible or unlimited, in law or in administrative reality.\n\n\n\n\nOwnership, even in its core meaning, is not a logical simple\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYanner v Eaton (1999) 201 CLR 351\n\nthe High Court of Australia considered the different conceptions of “property”, particularly in terms of the legal relationship with a “thing”\nIn that case, the appellant was an aboriginal man who had killed two animals for his own consumption\nHe was charged with taking “fauna” from the area without a licence, which was alleged to be in contravention of statute which made all “fauna” “property” of the Crown.\nBecause “property” is a comprehensive term it can be used to describe all or any of very many different kinds of relationship between a person and a subject matter\nDifficulties\n\nFirst, there is the difficulty in identifying what fauna is owned by the Crown.\n\nIf it leaves border does crown still own it, or any fauna ever crossing border is owned?\n\n\nSecondly, what exactly is meant by saying that the Crown has full beneficial, or absolute, ownership of a wild bird or animal?\n\nAs Holmes J said in Missouri v Holland: “Wild birds are not in the possession of anyone; and possession is the beginning of ownership”\n\n\nThirdly, the property rights of the Crown would come and go according to the operation of the exception contained in s 7(1) of fauna taken or kept “otherwise than in contravention of this Act during an open season with respect to that fauna”.\nFourthly, it is necessary to consider why property in some fauna is vested in the Crown\n\n\n\n\nMeagher Gummow &amp; Lehane’s Equity: Doctrines and Remedies\n\nOften, “property” is used to refer to any object, tangible or abstract, which is owned or is otherwise the object of property rights.\nProperty rights def\n\nrights in rem, are rights that the holder has against other persons in respect of the thing.\ndistinguished in the law from purely “personal rights”, or rights in personam which are rights available against a particular person or persons only and not in respect of a “thing” (property)\nMinimum elements of property rights: National Provincial Bank Ltd v Ainsworth [1965] AC\n\nit must be definable,\nidentifiable by third parties,\ncapable in its nature of assumption by third parties,\nand have some degree of permanence or stability.\n\n\nRights commonly associated with property are the right to exclude others, to transfer or assign the property, and the right to use and enjoy the property: see for example Milirrpum v Nabalco (1971) 17 FLR 141\n\n\nRight to exclude def\n\nThe right to exclude or allow access to a thing is one of the hallmarks of a proprietary right.\n\n\nRight to use def or enjoy\n\nIt is related to the right to exclude in the sense of affording valuable rights such as the right to license use of, or access to personal\n\n\nRight to transfer or assign: alienability def\n\nthe ability to transfer or dispose of the right.\nR v Toohey; Ex parte Meneling Station Pty Ltd (1982) 158 CLR 327\n\nis not in all circumstances an essential characteristic of a right of property and that by statute some forms of property are expressed to be inalienable\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValue a system of proprietary interests\n\n(a) The power to recover the property, the subject of the interest or the income there of (ie, a “property right”) compared with the recovery of compensation from the defendant payable from no specific fund;\n(b) The power to transfer the benefit of the interest to another;\n(c) The persistence of remedies in respect of the interest against third parties who thus assume liability thereto; and\n(d) The extent to which the interest may be displaced in favour of competing dealings by the grantor or others which interests in the subject matter (ie, priorities)\n\n\nBundle of right\n\nJT International SA v Commonwealth of Australia [2012] HCA 4\n‘property’ generally refers to ‘a legal relationship with a thing’ and in many cases is helpfully described as ‘a bundle of rights’\nMcCaughey v Commissioner of Stamp Duties (1945) 46 SR (NSW) 192\n\nEach separate piece of property consists of a bundle of proprietary rights relating to a particular object, including rights of administration and rights of enjoyment, the totality of which may be vested in a single person, or may be divided amongst a number of persons, as for example when they are shared by several who together own them all, jointly or in common”\n\n\n\n\nFarah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say-Dee Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 22\n\nFarah’s procurement of the

GmbH v Winnington Networks Ltd [2013] Ch 156 at [44]\n\n\nFixtures and identifying whether moveable or affixed to the land\n\nThe ultimate question, when determining whether on common law principles goods brought onto the land have become a fixture and thus part of the land, remains one of the objective intention with which the item was put in place, having regard to the degree and object of annexation of the item:\n\nTEC Desert Pty Ltd v Commissioner of State Revenue [2010] HCA 49 at [24]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgripower Barraba Pty Ltd v Blomfield [2015] NSWCA 30\n\nconcerned competing claims to a number of items of mineral processing plant and equipment which were located on a property owned by the respondents in New South Wales\nThe land had been sold by receivers with various items of mining and processing equipment inside a large shed and other items outside of the shed, including rollers, hoppers and crushers.\nPrinciples Addressed\n\nThe case discusses the law of fixtures, emphasizing the ancient maxim “quicquid plantatur solo, solo cedit” (what is affixed to the ground belongs to the ground), its Roman law origins, and its evolution in common law.\nIt highlights the historical context and evolution of fixture law, from prioritizing physical annexation to considering the purpose or intention behind annexation.\n\n\nKey Points\n\nLaw’s Evolution: The law of fixtures has adapted over time, moving away from a strict emphasis on physical annexation towards considering the intention behind the annexation and the purpose of the chattel on the land.\nModern Application: The doctrine has been adjusted to suit modern needs, recognizing exceptions and shifting focus to the purpose or object of annexation, reflecting changes in societal and commercial practices.\nIntention and Purpose: Whether an item becomes a fixture is primarily determined by the intention with which it was placed on the land and its purpose, including the degree of annexation and the object of annexation.\n\n\nFactors Considered:\n\nCourts consider various factors, including whether removal would damage the land or buildings, the mode and structure of annexation, and whether the item was intended to be permanent or temporary.\n\n\nTEST - the purpose or object of annexation elements\nWhether the attachment was for the better enjoyment of the property generally or for the better enjoyment of the land and/or buildings to which it was attached …\nThe nature of the property the subject of affixation …\nWhether the item was to be in position either permanently or temporarily\nCase Dependency:\n\nThe application of fixture law depends on the specific circumstances of each case, highlighting the complexity and nuanced nature of determining what constitutes a fixture.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThe doctrine of fixtures remains a vital part of Australian law, evolving to address modern realities while maintaining its foundational principles.\nThe Agripower Barraba Pty Ltd v Blomfield case illustrates the law’s adaptability and the ongoing relevance of intention and purpose in determining the status of fixtures.\n\n\n\n\nChoses in Action def\n\nIntangible and incorporeal\nTorkington v Magee [1902] 2 KB 427\n\n“Chose in Action” is a known legal expression used to describe all personal rights of property which can only be claimed or enforced by action, and not by taking physical possession\n\n\nPurely personal rights are not a form of property.\n\nJack v Smail (1905) 2 CLR 684 a grocer’s licence under the Victorian Licensing Act 1890 was held to be a purely personal right and not a property righ\n\n\nBy the late nineteenth century, legislation such as bankruptcy legislation expressly defined “goods and chattels” as including choses in action, and courts accepted that choses in action were a form of property : see, for example, Colonial Bank v Whinney (1885) 30 Ch D 261\nFour Chose classes - J G Starke QC\n\n(i) debts of various kinds; debentures; dividends; rights to rent; annuities; negotiable instruments (including bills of exchange, promissory notes and cheques);\n(ii) types of property not capable of physical possession such as shares, a fund in court, and option to purchase land or shares, policies of assurance and insurance, intellectual property; bills of lading and charterparties;\n(iii) equitable rights to property such as a beneficial interest in a trust; reversionary interest in settled property or trust funds, or interests in a partnership, and\n(iv) other rights enforceable by action such as those under contract or in tort, including claims for unliquidated damages; claims against directors or trustees for breach of duty or breach of trust; an assignor’s right to be indemnified by an assignee; a lessee’s claim for relief against forfeiture and other such claims.\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristics of choses in action\n\nEnforceability.\n\nA chose in action must be capable of being enforced by the rightholder (or creditor) against the dutyholder (or debtor): Goldsbrough, Mort &amp; Co Ltd v Tolson (1909) 10 CLR 470 at 479.\n\n\nIncorporeal and intangible.\n\nA chose in action is intangible and incorporeal. It is something which is not reducible to physical possession.\nA chose in action is an “immaterial legal object”: Goldsbrough, Mort &amp; Co Ltd v Tolson (1909) 10 CLR 470 at 479.41\n\n\nBare Right.\n\nA chose in action confers only a bare right: Allgemeine Versicherungs-Gesellschaft Helvetia v Administrator of German Property [1931] 1 KB 672 at 703 per Slesser LJ (citing 2 Blackstone’s Commentaries 396).\n\n\n\n\nLegal choses in action def\n\nLegal choses in action are those which were historically enforceable in a court of common law, such as a debt\nExamples\n\nDebt\n\n“debt” is a contractual obligation that a debtor is obliged to pay money to the creditor which has been accepted as a form of property right - king v brown\n\n\nNegotiable instruments (including bills of exchange, promissory notes and cheques):\n\nColonial Bank v Whinney (1886) 11 App Cas 426\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquitable choses in action def\n\nEquitable choses in action are those which were historically only recognised by a court of equity\nThe interest of the holder of an equitable interest in property is commensurate with their ability to compel the owner to recognise their interest and hold it for their benefit: see, for example, Glenn v Federal Commissioner of Land Tax (1920) 27 CL\nExamples\n\nshare or interest in a partnership:\n\nFCT v Everett (1980) 143 CLR 440\n\n\nThe interest of a beneficiary under a fixed trust:\n\nNorman v FCT (1963) 109 CLR 9 at 30;\n\n\n\n\nmere equity def\n\nMere equities are not proprietary rights, but are ancillary to them in the sense that they arise where a person has an equitable claim (such as a right to set aside a transaction for fraud, or undue influence, or a claim for rectification for mistake or part performance of a contract) which, if

which the original owner from whom it was acquired did not possess.\n\n\nNegotiable instruments\n\nnegotiable instruments enjoy a simpler system of transfer and the ability to transfer a title free of defect.\n\nWith negotiable instruments, however, the purchaser in good faith and for value acquires a title that is free from of all interests of which it had no notice at the time of the purchase, thus overriding the nemo dat rule that would otherwise apply if, say, a thief of the bill had sold it to the purchaser (or if the value in the instrument has instead been assigned as a mere

Australia\nIssue: Whether “delivery” under s 28(2) of the Sale of Goods Act 1923 (NSW) includes only actual delivery or also constructive delivery.\nKey Points: The court interpreted “delivery” to encompass both actual and constructive delivery, aligning with the Act’s definition emphasizing the voluntary transfer of possession.\n\nThe ruling highlights the law’s adaptability in recognizing various delivery methods, thereby protecting third-party interests in transactions made in good faith.\n\n\nDecision: The court affirmed that delivery within the legal context includes constructive methods, ensuring flexibility in the transfer of goods and safeguarding transactions involving third parties.\nSignificance: This case clarifies the scope of “delivery” in goods sale transactions, broadening the understanding to include non-physical transfers of possession, thus enhancing the protection for innocent purchasers.\n\n\nAbandonment of possession and occupation of

664 is early authority for the concept of a possessory title to goods in the hands of a finder.\n\nIssue: The case addressed the rights of a finder of lost property and liability for property damage by an apprentice’s actions.\nFacts: A chimney sweeper’s boy found a jewel and took it to a goldsmith for appraisal. The goldsmith’s apprentice removed the stones, offering the boy a small sum. The boy refused and demanded the jewel back, receiving only the empty socket.\nRuling: The court ruled the boy had the right to keep the jewel against all but the rightful owner and could claim damages. It held the master goldsmith liable for his apprentice’s actions, directing that damages be based on the value of the finest jewel that could fit the socket, presuming against the defendant for not producing the original stones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParker v British Airways Board [1982] 1 QB 1004\n\nLeading modern decision on the law of finding\nWhere the chattel is found on land occupied by another, the question will be whether there is evidence that the occupier has manifested a prior intention to exercise control over the premises and chattels found on the premises.\n\nCase Name and Citation:\n\nParker v British Airways Board [1982] 1 QB 1004 (England and Wales Court of Appeal - persuasive in other jurisdictions but binding in England and Wales).\n\n\nProcedural History:\n\nAppeal to the Court of Appeal from a lower court decision.\n\n\nOriginal Dispute:\n\nDispute over ownership rights to a gold bracelet found in an airport lounge.\n\n\nReason for Trial:\n\nTo determine the finder’s rights versus the occupier’s rights to lost property.\n\n\nMaterial Facts:\n\nAlan Parker found a gold bracelet in Heathrow Airport’s lounge and handed it to British Airways, requesting its return if unclaimed.\nThe airline later sold the bracelet.\n\n\nIssue Raised:\n\nWhether the finder of a lost item has rights to it against all but the true owner, including against the occupier of the premises where it was found.\n\n\nLaw(s)/Statute(s) in Contention:\n\nSale of Goods Act, principles regarding lost property and the rights of finders vs. occupiers.\n\n\nPrecedence:\n\nNot specifically mentioned, but the case draws on common law principles regarding lost property.\n\n\nTests:\n\nExamination of the intention to control the premises and items within by the occupier.\n\n\nWords and Phrases Considered:\n\n“Finder’s rights,”\n“occupier’s rights,”\n“constructive possession.”\n\n\nArguments:\n\nParker argued for the return of the bracelet or its value based on finder’s rights.\nBritish Airways argued based on occupier’s rights.\n\n\nJudges’ Thoughts:\n\nThe court sided with Parker, emphasizing the rights of the finder over the occupier in cases where the occupier does not manifest an intention to control lost items.\n\n\nLegal Reasoning and Ratio Decidendi:\n\nThe finder of a lost item has rights to it against all but the true owner, and these rights prevail over the occupier’s unless the occupier has shown an intention to exercise control over lost items found on their property.\n\n\nResult and Relevance:\n\nParker was entitled to the value of the bracelet.\nThis case reinforces the legal principle that finders have significant rights to lost property, clarifying the circumstances under which these rights are recognized over those claimed by property occupiers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPossession in Residential Premises\n\nGenerally, exclusive possession of residential premises will suffice to establish the required

occupied by Mrs. Flack, specifically a briefcase containing cash discovered in her leased residential property.\n\n\nReason for Trial:\n\nAppeal concerning the possessory rights over found chattels, including unknown items, within the premises.\n\n\nMaterial Facts:\n\nMrs. Flack, as the tenant, manifested an intention to exercise control over all chattels on the premises, known and unknown, prior to the discovery of a briefcase with cash.\n\n\nIssue Raised:\n\nWhether an occupier’s intention encompasses control over all chattels on the premises, subject to any superior right, even if unaware of their existence.\n\n\nLaw/Statute in Contention:\n\nCommon law principles regarding possession and control over chattels found on an occupier’s premises.\n\n\nPrecedence:\n\nComparison made with Parker v British Airways Board [1982] QB 1004 regarding occupier’s intention to control lost property.\n\n\nTests:\n\nEvaluation of the occupier’s manifest intention to possess or control chattels on the premises, irrespective of awareness of such chattels.\n\n\nArguments:\n\nMrs. Flack argued for a broad intention to control, inclusive of unknown chattels, based on her occupancy and possession of the premises.\n\n\nJudges’ Opinions:\n\nHEEREY J. concurred with principles from Parker v British Airways Board, emphasizing common sense in occupiers manifesting control over chattels within their premises.\n\n\nLegal Reasoning:\n\nOccupancy and legal possession of premises were deemed sufficient for Mrs. Flack to manifest control over all chattels therein, regardless of her awareness of specific items.\n\n\nRatio Decidendi:\n\nAn occupier’s legal possession of premises implies control over all chattels therein, known or unknown, barring superior claims.\n\n\nResult:\n\nThe appeal was dismissed, affirming Mrs. Flack’s implied control over the chattels, including the briefcase with cash found on her property.\n\n\nRelevance to Modern Law:\n\nThis case underscores the breadth of an occupier’s control over chattels within their premises, emphasizing the significance of occupancy and possession in law.\nIt illustrates the application of common law principles to determine possessory rights in scenarios involving found property, contributing to the understanding of property rights in residential contexts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterference with possession\n\nTrespass

possession of goods which has been interfered with or the mere fact of physical possession of a chattel gives the holder title to sue anyone in conversion except for someone with a superior title:\nJeffries v The Great Western Railway Co 119 ER 680\nPenfolds Wines Pty Ltd v Elliott (1946) 74 CLR 204\n\nIn that case, the respondent sold bulk wine to customers who provided their own bottles.\nThe appellant was a company which made wine and sold it in branded bottles over which it retained ownership.\nThe respondent had filled certain bottles for his brother which his brother had provided and sold the wine (but not the bottles) and delivered them to a third party, Mr Moon.\nMaterial Facts:\n\nPenfold Wines maintains ownership of the bottles in which they sell their wine, never parting with the property in these bottles.\nThey use invoices and bottle branding to inform customers that the bottles are lent, not given, and must be returned on demand.\nElliott, the respondent, was accused of refilling these bottles with wine for his customers, including using Penfold Wines’ bottles, without causing confusion or misappropriation of the bottles’ identities.\n\n\nIssue Raised:\n\nThe legality of Elliott’s actions in refilling and using Penfold Wines’ branded bottles, which were not sold but lent to customers under conditions that retained Penfold Wines’ ownership.\n\n\nLaw(s)/Statute(s) in Contention:\n\nCommon law principles regarding property rights, possession, and the torts of trespass and conversion.\n\n\nLegal Reasoning and Judicial Opinions:\n\nDixon J concluded there was no infringement upon Penfold Wines’ possession rights by Elliott.\nThe acts of refilling the bottles and returning them to the customers who brought them did not constitute trespass, conversion, or any other wrong to possession or property.\nTrespass was dismissed as Elliott did not invade the possession of anyone, and conversion was ruled out as there was no act or intent by Elliott inconsistent with Penfold Wines’ right to possession.\n\n\nRatio Decidendi:\n\nThe lawful possession of goods by delivery negates the possibility of being punished as a trespasser.\nIn cases where goods are lawfully possessed through delivery, wrongful acts like conversion require an intent to deprive the true owner of their immediate right to possession, which was not present in Elliott’s actions.\n\n\nResult:\n\nThe appeal for injunction and other equitable relief sought by Penfold Wines against Elliott was dismissed.\n\n\nRelevance to Modern Law:\n\nThis case emphasizes the importance of clear property rights and possession in cases of chattels lent out for specific purposes.\nIt underscores the necessity for a demonstrable intent to infringe upon the owner’s rights for actions to constitute conversion or trespass, highlighting the nuances in property law regarding possession and ownership rights over personal chattels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConversion does not apply to chose in action\n\nOBG v Allan [2007] UKHL 21\n\nJurisdiction:\n\nUnited Kingdom, House of Lords (now the Supreme Court); binding in the UK.\n\n\nProcedural History:\n\nThis case reached the House of Lords, the highest court of appeal at the time, for final judgment.\n\n\nOriginal Dispute:\n\nThe dispute involved the tort of conversion, specifically whether it applies to intangible property such as contractual rights or debts.\n\n\nReason for Trial:\n\nThe core legal question was whether the scope of the tort of conversion, traditionally applied to personal chattels, could be extended to include intangible assets.\n\n\nMaterial Facts:\n\nThe case focused on the wrongful actions of receivers who were argued to have interfered with a company’s contractual rights, among other assets.\n\n\nIssue Raised:\n\nCan the tort of conversion be applied to intangible property, such as contractual rights, in addition to tangible personal property?\n\n\nLaw(s)/Statute(s) in Contention:\n\nTraditional common law principles of conversion which historically applied only to tangible chattels.\n\n\nPrecedences:\n\nReference to historical cases and legislative acts such as the Factors Act 1889, Cheques Act 1957, and Insolvency Act, which modify or clarify the law of conversion for specific scenarios but do not extend it to intangible property.\n\n\nTests:\n\nThe case did not introduce new tests but discussed the application of existing principles of conversion to intangible assets.\n\n\nWords and Phrases Considered:\n\n“Conversion” in the context of property law, traditionally associated with tangible personal property, not intangible assets.\n\n\nArguments:\n\nThe appellants argued for a broader interpretation of conversion that includes intangible assets.\nThe House of Lords examined legislative history, common law principles, and the practical implications of such an extension.\n\n\nJudicial Opinions:\n\nLord Hoffmann led the discussion against extending conversion to intangible property, emphasizing strict liability’s traditional scope and legislative intent.\nBaroness Hale explored the logical extension of conversion to all forms of property but ultimately concurred with the majority.\n\n\nLegal Reasoning:\n\nThe House of Lords reasoned based on historical context, statutory interpretation, and the potential consequences of extending strict liability to intangible property, concluding that conversion remains confined to tangible personal property.\n\n\nRatio Decidendi:\n\nConversion does not apply to intangible assets like contractual rights; it remains limited to tangible personal property.\nThe decision reflects a cautious approach to expanding strict liability torts beyond their traditional scope.\n\n\nResult:\n\nThe claim in conversion for intangible property was unanimously rejected.\n\n\nRelevance to Modern Law:\n\nOBG v Allan is a landmark case reaffirming the boundaries of the tort of conversion in English law.\nIt illustrates the judiciary’s reluctance to extend strict liability principles to new domains without clear legislative guidance, underscoring the importance of tangible property in conversion claims.\nThe case highlights the conservative nature of common law evolution concerning property rights and economic interests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetinue def\n\nwhere the

Possession is immediate control.\n\nThe property is in your control. So if the property i a cup, you possess if you control it, eg holding it or putting in your cupboard\n\n\nOwnership — The person who has the better right to the property.\n\nOwnership is more permanent. The cup is yours permanently. Contrast: ‘l own a cup (l bought and paid for it)’ with ‘you are holding my cup’. You have possession (physical control), I have the right to the cup (l own it). I can take it back from you.\n\n\nTitle. This tends to be used interchangeably with ownership — we usually use this word in the context of valuable property (car, house).\n\nI own the car. I have title to it.\nTitle can also refer to the document which evidences that you own something. Title deeds to your house.\n\n\nPossessory title - ownership based on possession\n\nIf not claimed after turning over to the police, then you have possessory title.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 3: Equitable

a beneficial interest in property in Queensland for the purposes of attracting succession duty under the Succession and Probate Duties Acts 1892 (Qld)\nIt was held that that interest was not relevantly a beneficial interest, whilst transmissible by will, in property.\nThe QLD Succession and Probate Duties Acts 1892 levied duty “upon every devolution by law of any beneficial interests in property” being an interest in real or personal property situated in QLD.\nMrs Coulson died in NSW but the time of her death was entitled to 1/3 share in the residue of her deceased husband’s unadministered estate which included real and personal property in both QLD and NSW.\nThe Stamp Duties Commissioner for QLD sought to tax Mrs.\n\nCoulson’s estate in QLD (succession duty) on the basis that Mrs Coulson died owning a proprietary interest in real and personal property in Queensland.\n\n\nThe Privy Council held that Mrs Coulson had no proprietary rights in equity.\n\nShe only had a right to compel due administration of her husband’s estate that was a personal right.\nAccordingly, no succession duty was payable.\n\n\n\n\nMere equities are not proprietary rights, but are ancillary to them in the sense that they arise where a person has an equitable claim\n\n(such as a right to set aside a transaction for fraud, or undue influence, or a claim for rectification for mistake or

Duties (Qld) v Livingston [1965] 1 AC 694, 712: ‘Equity… calls into existence and protects equitable rights and interests in property only where their recognition has been found to be required to give effect to its doctrines.’\nEquitable property rights can vary in terms of the characteristics of transmissibility, priority, permanence, the remedies available to enforce them, and other matters.\nEquity at all times presupposes the existence and validity of the common law and legal rights to property, but recognises additional rights to that property\n\nSome claims for equitable relief are not property rights at all – they are simply personal rights.\n\n\n\n\nHierarchy of Equitable Interests\n\nEquitable Proprietary Interests\nMere Equity\nPersonal Equity (not a property right)\n\n\nEquitable Proprietary Interests\n\nAll equitable interests in property are choses in action – intangible rights with respect to property owned by another.\nBind the holder of the legal interest and volunteers, but not a purchaser for good faith without notice.\nTransfer of the legal property to a third party for value without notice (actual, constructive or imputed) of the equitable interest, will destroy the underlying equitable interest.\nRegistration of the legal interest over Torrens land on the register by a purchaser affords the purchaser ‘indefeasibility of title’ unless an exception to indefeasibility (such as fraud) applies.\nCreated less formally\n\n\nCreation of Equitable Interests in Property\n\nEquitable interests can be created by:\n\n1.Agreement i.e. intentionally;\n2.By express trust;\n3.By operation of law: e.g. by court order as a remedy\n4.By implication of law: e.g. resulting trust, equitable lien\n\n\n\n\nExamples of equitable proprietary interests\n\nInterest of a partner in assets of a partnership:\n\nCanny Gabriel Castle Jackson Advertising Pty ltd v Volume Sales Finance Pty Ltd (1974) 131 CLR 321, 327-328.\n\n\nEquitable interests created by creation of security interests in property – e.g. an unregistered mortgage will be treated as an equitable mortgage.\n\nJ H Just (Holdings) Pty Ltd v Bank of New South Wales (1971) 125 CLR 546.\n\n\nAn equitable charge arising from contractual agreement that property be held as security for a debt.\nThe interest of a beneficiary under a fixed trust (not a discretionary trust)\nThe trustee’s right to be indemnified from trust assets in respect of properly incurred trust expenses\nA restrictive covenant over land:\n\nTulk v Moxhay (1848) 2 Ph 774; 41 ER 1143 which established that there are occasions in which equitable covenants can bind future purchasers of property and ‘run with the land’.\n\n\n\n\nThe equitable proprietary interest of a beneficiary under a fixed trust\n\nA trust can be defined as a relationship between a person known as the trustee, who undertakes to hold property, of which it is the legal owner, exclusively for the benefit of others, known as the beneficiaries.\nA trust is not a company and has no separate legal entity – it is an undertaking recognised in equity to give a proprietary interest in the beneficiaries.\nRequires three certainties:\n\nCertainty of intention (to create a trust)\nCertainty of subject matter (any presently existing legal or equitable property)\nCertainty of object (the identity of the beneficiaries)\n\n\nThe right of a beneficiary under a fixed trust is regarded as the highest form of equitable proprietary right.\n\nA fixed trust has a trust instrument which determines beneficial shares.\n\n\n\n\nBeneficial interest in a fixed trust compared to a discretionary trust\n\nThe interest of a beneficiary under a fixed trust is determined by the trust instrument.\n\nThis is an equitable proprietary interest.\n\n\nUnder a discretionary trust, the trustee has a discretion to choose who of a class of beneficiaries to pay.\n\nNo beneficiary has any interest in trust assets unless or until they are selected.\nTherefore the only right is a personal right in equity, to compel proper administration of the estate by the trustee. E.g., discretionary legatees under a will have only a right to be considered by the executor for the purposes of the administration of the estate: Gartside v. IRC [1968] AC 553 House of Lords.\n\n\n\n\nPersonal Equity/personal rights\n\nA personal equity is simply the basic right of access to a court of equity of a plaintiff seeking equitable remedies that are not a proprietary remedy.\nNot a proprietary right at all:\n\nnot an interest in property.\n\n\nIncapable of assignment\nDoes not attach to particular assets\nNational Provincial Bank v. Ainsworth [1965] Ac 1175 at 1238; 2 All ER 472 at 488 per Lord Upjohn:\n\n\nImportance of understanding the nature of the equity –is it proprietary or not\n\nThe nature of the equity can be important for questions such as taxation, liability to duty, or in a priority dispute with other interests.\nFor example:\n\nBaker v Archer-Shee [1927] AC 844\nCommissioner of Stamp Duties (Qld) v Livingston [1965] AC 694\nLatec Investments v Hotel Terrigal Pty Ltd (1965) 113 CLR 265.\n\n\n\n\nBaker v Archer-Shee [1927] AC 844\n\nAn American citizen left the residue property to his daughter, the wife of Lord Archer-Shee, on trust.\nThe property consisted of foreign securities, stocks and shares and income from it was paid into an American bank account.\nThe issue was whether Lord Archer-Shee was liable to pay tax on the income and whether her right under the will was “property”.\nThe House of Lords held that it was a “proprietary right”, not merely a personal right against the trustee and accordingly, the income was taxable.\n\n\nLatec Investments v Hotel Terrigal Pty Ltd (1965) 113 CLR 265\n\nHotel Terrigal was the owner of a hotel which was mortgaged to Latec Investments.\nHotel Terrigal defaulted on its mortgage obligations and Latec Investments had an equitable power of sale under the mortgage which it exercised and sold the property to Southern Hotels, which was a totally owned subsidiary of Latec.\nTo raise money Southern gave an equitable interest to MLC as security by way of a floating charge over the hotel property.\nFollowing the default of Southern, the floating charge crystallised.\n5 years after the sale, HT sought to set aside the sale as a fraudulent exercise of the mortgagee’s power of sale.\nThe HC held that, although the mortgagor was entitled to an order setting aside the sale this interest was a “mere equity” which did not compete in a priority competition with the equitable proprietary interest of MLC under its charge.\nJurisdiction:\n\nSupreme Court of New South Wales, Equitable Jurisdiction\n\n\nProcedural History:\n\nAppeal from the decree of the Supreme Court of NSW setting aside a sale and transfer of land under the Real Property Act due to non-compliance with the Money-lenders and Infants Loans Act, and fraud in the exercise of the mortgagee’s power of sale.\n\n\nOriginal Dispute:\n\nConcerned the enforceability of a mortgage and the validity of a sale under a mortgagee’s power of sale.\n\n\nCurrent Reason for Trial:\n\nTo determine if the sale could be set aside due to alleged fraud in the exercise of the mortgagee’s power of sale.\n\n\nMaterial Facts:\n\nThe mortgagee lent money to the mortgagor, securing the loan with a mortgage over land including Hotel Terrigal.\nThe mortgagee, upon learning of potential interest in the property, decided to sell it to a subsidiary, setting up an auction perceived as not genuinely intended to sell the property but to justify a sale to the subsidiary.\nThe sale was conducted without real intention to obtain a fair price, aiming instead to transfer the property to the mortgagee’s subsidiary.\n\n\nIssue:\n\nWhether the sale of the mortgaged property was conducted in fraud of the mortgagor, justifying the setting aside of the sale.\n\n\nLaw/Statute in Contention:\n\nReal Property Act, 1900-1956 (N.S.W.), sections regarding the indefeasibility of a registered title, and equitable principles concerning mortgagee’s sale.\n\n\nPrecedence:\n\nCited previous decisions on the principles of mortgagee’s sales and fraud.\n\n\nJudicial Opinions:\n\nKitto J., leading the opinion, found the sale was not in good faith but constituted fraud against the mortgagor. The appeal was allowed, with the sale to the subsidiary and the subsequent dealings based on it being disrupted.\nEmphasized that mortgagees are not obligated to obtain the highest possible price but must act in good faith, concluding the sale was a pretense.\n\n\nLegal Reasoning/Ratio Decidendi:\n\nThe exercise of the power of sale by the mortgagee in favor of its subsidiary, without genuine efforts to obtain a fair market price, constituted fraud against the mortgagor.\nThe court would have normally set aside the sale, recognizing the mortgagor’s right to redeem the property, but due to the delay in asserting this right and intervening interests, considerations were given to the positions of other parties affected by the sale.\n\n\nConclusion and Relevance to Modern Law:\n\nThe appeal was allowed; the court made declarations respecting the rights of the parties involved, acknowledging the mortgagee’s and the trustee’s charges over the property, but also the mortgagor’s eventual right to challenge the validity of the mortgagee’s actions under certain conditions.\nThis case emphasizes the necessity of good faith in the exercise of a mortgagee’s power of sale and outlines the consequences of a failure to act within this boundary, illustrating the balancing act courts perform between competing equitable interests.\n\n\nFocus for Notes:\n\nThe principles guiding the exercise of a mortgagee’s power of sale, especially the requirement of good faith and the potential for a sale to be set aside as fraudulent.\nThe interaction between legal principles and equitable interests when a sale is challenged for not being conducted in good faith.\n\n\nRole of Equitable Proprietary Interests in Commercial Law\n\nPersonal property is now the most significant form of wealth in modern economies.\nTrade and investment in choses in action includes both legal choses in action and equitable choses in action.\nOf particular importance in Australian commerce is the commercial use of the trust as an investment and profit making enterprise, where the investors are beneficiaries in the trust and where the trustee manages trust property with a view to making profit for investors.\n\n\nAdvantages to the use of such trading or commercial trusts include taxation:\n\ngenerally trust not taxed as an entity so may make distributions of profits in gross (and losses) to beneficiaries who may be taxed at a lower rate, and distributions of capital.\nThere are further structural advantages – far less regulated than corporations.\n\n\nFor further information see: N D’ Angelo Transacting with Trusts and Trustees (LexisNexis Australia 2020)\n\n\nThe Use of the Commercial Trust under Australian law\n\nSuperannuation:\n\nall superannuation funds are highly regulated forms of trusts.\nEmployees members have an interest in the trust property, rights which are defined by contract.\n\n\nManaged Investment Schemes:\n\nalmost all in the form of a public unit trust.\nFor example, real estate investment trusts (which if they meet relevant criteria are regulated under Part 5C of the Corporations Act.)\n\n\nTrading trusts\n\ngenerally taken to mean a trust (either a unit trust or discretionary trust) where the trustee is given power to carry on business activities with trust assets and functions as an alternative to a corporation.\nUsually the trustee is a corporate entity with nominal value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 4: Bailment and Agency\n\nBailment\n\nBailment def\n\n‘A bailment comes into existence upon delivery of goods of one person, the bailor, into the possession of another person, the bailee, upon a promise, express or implied, that they will be re-delivered to the bailor or dealt with in a stipulated way.’:\n\nHobbs v Pe tersham Transport Co Pty Ltd (1971) 124 CLR 220, 238 (Windeyer J).\n\n\nThe voluntary assumption of possession is key; there must be knowledge of the goods and the bailee’s consent to hold them:\n\nWD &amp; HO Wills (Aust) v State Rail Authority of New South Wales (1998) 43 NSWLE 336, 353-4.\n\n\n\n\nBailment terminology\n\nBailor: party who gives possession of goods to another\nBailee: takes possession but not ownership of goods\nSub-bailee: takes possession from bailee\nCan only arise in relation to chattels, not choses in action.\nNo intention that there will be a transfer of ownership: typically involves keeping the goods for safe custody or transporting the goods, or doing something to the goods and returning them.\nCan be for reward or gratuitous\n\n\nTypes of bailment: bailment for reward\n\nBailee is paid for taking custody or control of goods.\nCustody for reward. eg: carparks – if car left in custody and control of the carpark owner.\nHire of work and/or labour: eg\n\nagistment of cattle on land if cattle left in the custody and control of the landowner: see\n\nBig Top Hereford Pty ltd v Gavin Thomas [2006] NSWSC 1159;\n\n\nCar left with a mechanic for repairs;\ndrycleaners;\nFurniture movers.\n\n\nPledge – eg pawnbroker: Palgo Holdings Pty Ltd v Gowans (2005) 215 ALR 253 [17].\nHire-purchase – delivery of goods from the owner to the hirer who holds them for use by the hirer\n\n\nTypes of bailment: gratuitous (no consideration)\n\nGratuitous bailments arise where the bailee is not paid for taking possession of the property and the bailment is terminated on demand. Eg:\n\nDeposit – delivery of goods for gratuitous safekeeping by the bailee\nMandate – delivery of goods for work to be done on the goods without reward\nLoan – delivery of goods for use by bailee under gratuitous loan. Eg when a person lends their car to another to use and return.\n\n\nOther examples:\n\nUnder a sale of goods where title to property does not pass with transfer of possession, such as where there is a Romalpa clause and title will not pass until payment made in full: Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corp (1985) 156 CLR 41, 105. Purchaser a bailee until payment;\n\n\n\n\nBailment vs Licence\n\nA licence is a grant of permission to another to do something and includes a grant of permission to another use property or leave goods at property without an acceptance by the licensor of control over or responsibility for the goods.

The decision was overturned on appeal, emphasizing the bailee’s failure to meet their duty of care.\n\n\nOriginal Dispute:\n\nConcerned the theft of a motor vehicle from the respondent’s premises, which had been entrusted to them for repair—a classic instance of a bailment relationship.\n\n\nCurrent Reason for Trial:\n\nThe crux was to assess the adequacy of the bailee’s precautions against theft, specifically whether these actions were reasonable given the circumstances and the nature of the bailed property.\n\n\nMaterial Facts:\n\nThe appellant delivered a valuable, collector’s item vehicle to the respondent for repair services. Despite some security measures, the vehicle was stolen due to a break-in.\n\n\nIssue Raised:\n\nThe legal contention revolved around the bailee’s obligations under bailment to safeguard the bailed goods and the extent of care required to prevent theft.\n\n\nLaw(s)/Statute(s) in Contention:\n\nThe case delves into bailment law, focusing on the nuanced duty of care the bailee owes to the bailor, especially in preventing theft or damage to bailed goods.\n\n\nPrecedences:\n\nCited prior judgments highlight the established duty of bailees to take reasonable steps to protect bailed goods, adjusting this standard to the risk of theft.\n\n\nTests and Elements:\n\nExamination centered on the reasonableness of the bailee’s security measures, influenced by the value of the bailed goods and the prevailing risk of theft.\n\n\nJudicial Opinions and Interpretation:\n\nThe appellate court critiqued the trial judge’s findings, asserting that the post-theft security enhancements underscored their prior feasibility and the bailee’s negligence.\n\n\nRatio Decidendi:\n\nEmphasized that the bailee’s duty in a bailment extends to implementing reasonable and practicable security measures to prevent theft, influenced by the specific context of the bailed goods.\n\n\nResult:\n\nThe appellate decision mandated the bailee to compensate the bailor for the stolen vehicle’s value plus interest, highlighting the bailee’s breach of duty in safeguarding the bailed property.\n\n\nRelevance to Modern Law:\n\nThis case underlines the dynamic nature of a bailee’s duty of care, particularly against theft, setting a precedent for how security measures should be evaluated in light of the specific circumstances of the bailment and the inherent risks.\nIt stresses the significance of foreseeability in determining the scope of reasonable care required from bailees.\n\nin the light of available precautions and their cost, the steps taken by the defendant were sufficient in the circumstances in which his business was operating (including the area in which it was situated and the nature of the property on his premises) to be regarded by the court, looking at the question objectively, as reasonable for safeguarding the property of the plaintiff.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Role of Contract Law in Bailments\n\nContract determines scope of bailment and nature of duties and liabilities\nExclusion clauses operate according to terms\nImplied terms in bailments for reward (hire) eg that goods are reasonably fit for purpose\nBailment operates more broadly than contract by:\n\nModifying privity rule by conferring rights against third parties\nBailee may sue third party for damages caused to bailed goods as possession is title against the wrongdoer (The Winkfield [1902] P 42)\n\n\n\n\nTermination of Bailment\n\nA bailment may come to an end by:\n\nExpiry of the term\nDemand of gratuitous bailee, at any time\nBy wrongful act of bailee\nRe-delivery of goods to the bailor\nTransfer of ownership to the bailee\nDestruction of the goods\n\n\n\n\nEnforcement by Bailor\n\nA bailor who suffers loss or damage to goods may have a range of different actions:\n\nContract\n\nDamages for breach of contract (suing on the rights under the contract with the bailee) to put bailor in position as if the contract had been performed.\n\n\nTort\n\ndetinue for delivery up of the goods\nDamages for conversion – dealing in a manner repugnant to immediate right of possession of person with title to property\nDamages for trespass to goods – to put the bailor back in the position as if the wrong had not occurred;

Peter enters into contract for printing press and signs against company printed order form per Bruce Jr.\n\n\nHeld:\n\nBruce Jr as managing director had ostensible authority to purchase and could have actually authorized Peter.\nHowever it was found that he did not give actual authority in the first place, therefore Peter could not have ostensible authority derived from Bruce Jr.\nFurther Bruce Jr had no actual authority to make the contract, only the Board or three directors acting together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuties of an Agent\n\nAn agent is a fiduciary so owes to the principal the fiduciary duties:\n\nto act bona fides in the interests of the principal\nNot to place itself in a position of conflict between self-interest and duty\nNot to profit from the scope of the undertaking (save for agreed remuneration or commission)\n\n\nto follow the principal’s instructions\nto act in person (not delegate responsibility)\nto act in good faith\nto make a full disclosure of any personal interest\nto not make a secret profit\nto exercise reasonable care and skill\n\n\nRights of an Agent\n\nRemuneration: no right to remuneration outside of contract.

232 CLR 138 the Court noted at [5]\n\n… In the interpretation of a provision of an Act, a construction that would promote the purpose or object underlying the Act is to be preferred to a construction that would not promote that purpose or object.\nWhatever the difficulties of construction may be, a court is bound to give some meaning to a provision in a statute, and a court cannot hold that an Act is a nullity because of the uncertainty of the language used.\n\n\n\n\nWords are generally given their ordinary meaning\n\nWords will generally be interpreted in accordance with their ordinary and current meaning unless there is some indication that a different meaning is intended.\n\nAustralian Leisure and Hospitality Group Pty Ltd v Director of Liquor Licensing [2012] WASC 463\n\n\nCheck the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth)/Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW) for common definitions\nCan extrinsic materials can assist in interpretation?

These are:\n\n(1) legislation in each state that is substantially identical, codifying the common law – in NSW being the Sale of Goods Act 1923 (NSW);\n(2) other specific statutes regulating or dealing with sale of goods transactions (not covered in this subject other than the Australian Consumer Law found in Schedule 2 to the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth), such as the (NSW) Factors (Mercantile Agents) Act 1923, and the National Credit Code); and\n(3) the common law, including contract law, the law of personal property that is not otherwise changed by the relevant legislation\n\n\nThe Sale of Goods legislation is regarded as codifying the law.\n\nThe proper approach to such legislation is in the first instance to examine the language of the statute and ask what is its natural meaning, although of course, reference will often be made to prior law where a provision is unclear or if words have previously acquired a technical meaning\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian Consumer Law\n\nThe Australian Consumer Law is found in Schedule 2 to the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth). The Australian Consumer Law (ACL) is a comprehensive regime to provide protection to consumers.\nThe ACL applies as a law of the Commonwealth under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) (“the CCA”), comprising:\n\nSchedule 2 of the CCA;\nThe provisions of Part XI of the CCA that relate to Schedule 2 and Regulations under the CCA relating to the ACL.\nThe ACL also applies as a law of each state and territory.\nIn NSW that is under the Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW).\n\n\nThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (ASIC Act), provides for the same protections in relation to financial products and services as provided under the AC\nThe main differences between the ACL and SOGA in relation to consumer guarantees:\n\nCover different transactions: SOGA applies to contracts for the sale of goods whereas ACL applies to contracts for the supply of both goods and services;\nImpose obligations on different persons: the SOGA applies to sellers whereas the ACL also applies to manufacturers and suppliers;\nCreate rights in favour of different persons\n\n\n\n\nPersonal Property Securities Act 2009 (Cth)\n\nRe Maiden Civil [2013] NSWSC 852 and replaces more than 40 existing state registration systems for security interests over personal property with one Commonwealth register\nthe PPSA regime is not a complete code. (see s 254)\nIt deals with priority contests involving PPSA security interests, although not all priority contests are covered by PPSA rules (e.g. for those that involve non-PPSA security interests)\n\nIt is critical for lawyers to appreciate if the PPSA applies or not. Some interests are NOT covered – look at s 8 of the Act\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGamer’s Motor Centre (Newcastle) Pty Ltd v Natwest Wholesale Australia Pty Ltd [1987] HCA 30; (1987) 163 CLR 236\n\nJurisdiction:\n\nHigh Court of Australia, binding within Australia.\n\n\nProcedural History:\n\nOriginated from the Supreme Court of New South Wales.\nConcerns the application of s. 28(2) of the Sale of Goods Act 1923 (NSW).\n\n\nOriginal Dispute:\n\nDispute over possession and title to eight motor vehicles between Gamer’s Motor Centre (Newcastle) Pty Ltd (Gamer, a wholesaler) and Natwest Wholesale Australia Pty Ltd (Natwest, a finance company).\n\n\nCurrent Reason for Trial:\n\nAppeal to the High Court of Australia to determine whether “delivery” under s. 28(2) of the Sale of Goods Act 1923 (NSW) includes constructive delivery, allowing Natwest to claim title to the vehicles despite not having received physical delivery from the dealer.\n\n\nMaterial Facts:\n\nA dealer agreed to buy vehicles from Gamer but sold them to Natwest without paying Gamer.\nNatwest paid the dealer without physical delivery of the vehicles, claiming title based on documents and agreements.\n\n\nIssue Raised:\n\nWhether the Sale of Goods Act permits constructive delivery to transfer title under s. 28(2), enabling Natwest to acquire title to the vehicles from the dealer who had not paid Gamer.\n\n\nLaw(s)/Statute(s) in Contention:\n\nSale of Goods Act 1923 (NSW), specifically s. 28(2).\n\n\nJudicial Opinions and Interpretation:\n\nMajority Opinion: The High Court, with a majority, held that “delivery” under s. 28(2) of the Sale of Goods Act includes constructive delivery.\n\nThis interpretation allows a third party, like Natwest, to acquire good title to goods despite the original seller’s (Gamer’s) rights being superseded, provided the goods or documents of title were received in good faith without notice of the original seller’s claim.\n\n\nDissenting Opinion: A different interpretation argued that actual physical delivery is required for s. 28(2) to apply, emphasizing protection of property rights over facilitating commerce.\n\n\nRatio Decidendi:\n\nThe High Court’s decision broadens the concept of “delivery” within the context of the Sale of Goods Act to include constructive delivery, facilitating the movement of goods in commercial transactions and offering protection to third parties who deal in good faith.\n\n\nConclusion and Relevance to Modern Law:\n\nThe ruling confirms that, within the framework of Australian commercial law, constructive delivery can suffice to transfer title under s. 28(2) of the Sale of Goods Act.\nThis outcome supports commercial efficiency and the protection of third parties in good faith transactions, while highlighting the tension between traditional property rights and the needs of modern commerce.\n\n\nNotes Emphasis:\n\nFocus on the legal reasoning behind extending “delivery” to include constructive delivery and the implications for commercial transactions and property rights in Australian law.\n\n\n\n\nSAMWISE HOLDINGS PTY LTD v ALLIED DISTRIBUTION FINANCE PTY LTD &amp; ORS [2018] SASCFC 95\n\nThe focus is on the timing of possession where the circumstances of possession changes but not the fact of possession).\nProcedural History:\n\nAppeal from a lower court decision granting declaratory relief that the respondent’s perfected purchase money security interest (PMSI) under the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 (Cth) had priority over other registered security interests concerning 40 motorcycles.\n\n\nOriginal Dispute:\n\nThe original dispute centered around the priority of security interests under the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 (Cth), specifically regarding whether a perfected PMSI has priority over all other registered security interests in the context of 40 motorcycles.\n\n\nCurrent Reason for Trial:\n\nThe trial was to determine if the PMSI of the respondent was perfected by registration before the grantor obtained possession of the motorcycles, thus having priority over other security interests.\n\n\nMaterial Facts:\n\nAllied Distribution Finance Pty Ltd had a PMSI in 40 motorcycles previously owned and financed under a different arrangement.\nAllied Distribution’s interest was registered before it obtained ownership and issued bailed goods notices, but the motorcycles were already in possession of the dealership under a different finance arrangement.\n\n\nIssue Raised:\n\nDoes a PMSI in inventory have priority over other registered security interests if it is perfected by registration before the grantor (or another person at the grantor’s request) obtains possession of the inventory?\n\n\nLaw(s)/Statute(s) in Contention:\n\nPersonal Property Securities Act 2009 (Cth), specifically sections relating to PMSIs and their priority (e.g., s 62(2)(b)(i)).\n\n\nPrecedences:\n\nReferences to decisions and principles from various jurisdictions on PMSIs and the requirement of perfection by registration relative to possession by the grantor.\n\n\nJudicial Opinions and Interpretation:\n\nThe Full Court unanimously dismissed the appeal, affirming the trial court’s decision.\nIt held that the phrase “obtains possession” in the context of PMSI priority refers to possession ‘as grantor’ and not mere physical possession.\nThis interpretation aligns with the purpose of the PPS Act to provide clear priority rules and protect future secured parties by ensuring timely notice through registration.\n\n\nLegal Reasoning:\n\nThe court focused on the statutory interpretation of the PPS Act, especially the language and purpose of provisions related to PMSIs.\nIt concluded that possession by the grantor as contemplated in the act refers to when the grantor, in its capacity as such, obtains possession, reinforcing the importance of registration timing for priority.\n\n\nRatio Decidendi:\n\nThe decision establishes that for a PMSI to have priority over other security interests in inventory under the PPS Act, it must be perfected by registration at the time the grantor, in its capacity as such, obtains possession of the inventory.\nThis interpretation ensures the protection of future creditors by emphasizing the significance of the registration process.\n\n\nRelevance to Modern Law:\n\nThis decision clarifies the application of PPSI priority rules under the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 (Cth), specifically regarding the critical timing of registration and possession in the grantor’s capacity.\nIt is pivotal for future secured transactions involving PMSIs, ensuring legal practitioners and financiers understand the importance of the order and timing of registration and possession in securing priority.\n\n\n\n\nVautin v BY Winddown, Inc.

(first respondent) and Eagle Yachts Pty Ltd (second respondent) over a defective recreational fishing vessel named “Revive”.\nEagle Yachts pursued a cross-claim against Bertram Yachts for indemnity.\n\n\nOriginal Dispute\n\nMr. Vautin purchased “Revive” for a significant sum, asserting it was defectively manufactured, rendering it unseaworthy.\n\n\nReason for Trial\n\nTo determine the liability of Bertram Yachts and Eagle Yachts for the alleged defects and the appropriate remedy.\n\n\nMaterial Facts\n\nMr. Vautin disclosed the purpose of open ocean motoring at the time of purchase.\nPost-purchase, “Revive” exhibited hull delamination due to manufacturing defects, specifically unfilled kerfs and inadequately primed foam core in the sandwich construction of the hull, decks, and superstructure.\n\n\nIssue Raised\n\nWhether Bertram Yachts and Eagle Yachts breached Australian Consumer Law (ACL) guarantees, particularly regarding acceptable quality and fitness for disclosed purpose.\n\n\nLaws/Statutes in Contention\n\nAustralian Consumer Law (ACL), part of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth).\n\n\nPrecedents Cited\n\nMedtel Pty Ltd v Courtney [2003] FCAFC 151 and similar cases interpreting “acceptable quality” and “fitness for a disclosed purpose” under the ACL.\n\n\nTests &amp; Elements Outlined\n\nThe case involved applying ACL standards to assess whether the vessel met guarantees of acceptable quality and fitness for a disclosed purpose, considering the nature of the goods, price, statements made about the goods, and other relevant circumstances.\n\n\nJudicial Opinions &amp; Interpretation\n\nThe court found both Bertram Yachts and Eagle Yachts liable to Mr. Vautin for breaches of ACL guarantees.\nIt rejected Bertram’s defense regarding its non-responsiveness to warranty claims and non-compliance with manufacturing standards.\n\n\nLegal Reasoning &amp; Ratio Decidendi\n\nThe court’s decision was based on the vessel not being of acceptable quality and not fit for the disclosed purpose of ocean-going motoring, due to significant manufacturing defects impacting safety and durability.\n\n\nConclusion &amp; Relevance to Modern Law\n\nThis case reaffirms the standards set by the ACL for acceptable quality and fitness for a disclosed purpose, emphasizing the rights of consumers to receive goods that meet explicit and implicit standards.\nIt underscores manufacturers’ and distributors’ obligations under the ACL, particularly in relation to high-value consumer goods.\n\n\nNotes for Examination\n\nFocus on the application of ACL guarantees, the interpretation of “acceptable quality” and “fitness for a disclosed purpose”, and the importance of manufacturing standards in assessing liability. The case illustrates judicial scrutiny of manufacturing processes and consumer protection laws’ role in ensuring the safety and reliability of purchased goods.\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 6: Sale of Goods Act Part 1\n\nTopic 6 – Transfer of property in goods\n\nThe “transfer of property” in goods means the transfer of legal ownership from seller to the Buyer.\n\nRemember: property (or ownership) in goods can pass independently of possession.\nThe time at which ownership passes in a sale can be very important for a number of reasons including:\n\nwhen goods are lost or destroyed prior to delivery;\nIn insolvency;\nRights and remedies under the Act;\nIn tort.\n\n\n\n\nS 5 Statutory Definitions\n\n“Contract of sale” includes an agreement to sell as well as a sale.\n“Buyer” means a person who buys or agrees to buy goods.\n“Seller” means a person who sells or agrees to sell goods.\n\n\nRight to sell and transfer of ownership\n\nUnder the Sale of Goods Act, “seller” is defined as a person who sells or agrees to sell goods.”\nThe seller does NOT have to be the owner of the goods.\nThe Act contemplates sale of goods by owners and non-owners.\nIn either case, the object of a contract for sale of goods is to confer good title (that of ownership) to the buyer.\n\n\nS 6 Sale and agreement to sell\n\n(1) A contract of sale of goods is a contract whereby the seller transfers or agrees to transfer the property in goods to the buyer for a money consideration called the price.\nThere may be a contract of sale between one part owner and another.\n(2) A contract of sale may be absolute or conditional.\n(3) Where under a contract of sale the property in the goods is transferred from the seller to the buyer, the contract is called a sale; but where the transfer of the property in the goods is to take place at a future time, or subject to some condition thereafter to be fulfilled, the contract is called an agreement to sell.\n(4)An agreement to sell becomes a sale when the time elapses or the conditions are fulfilled, subject to which the property in the goods is to be transferred.\n\n\nWhat a contract for sale is NOT\n\nNote that it can be tricky to distinguish a contract for sale of goods from a contract for work and materials that is a contract for services.\n\nCompare s 6 with:\n\nMortgage,\nPledge,\nCharge,\nLien,\nBailment,\nhire purchase:\n\n\nnone of these is a contract for sale.\n\n\n\n\nSection 17 Implied undertaking as to title etc\n\nIn a contract of sale, unless the circumstances of the contract are such as to show a different intention, there is:\n\n(1) an implied condition on the part of the seller that in the case of a sale the seller has a right to sell the goods, and that in the case of an agreement to sell the seller will have a right to sell the goods at the time when the property is to pass,\n(2) an implied warranty that the buyer shall have and enjoy quiet possession of the goods,\n(3) an implied warranty that the goods shall be free from any charge or encumbrance in favour of any third party not declared or known to the buyer before or at the time when the contract is made.\n\n\n\n\nThe nemo dat principle at common law\n\nIf the seller has good title, the buyer becomes the legal owner once property in the goods has passed to him (regardless of possession).\nIf the seller does not have good title (like a thief) the nemo dat principle applies – a person cannot convey what they do not have.\nA purported sale by someone who does not have good title means that the buyer does not obtain good title to the goods, but has a statutory ground for rejecting the goods and claiming a breach of implied warranty as to title.\nNote however, the Sale of Goods Act provides for certain exceptions to the nemo dat rule exceptions in ss 26-28.\n\n\nRowland v Divall [1923] 2 KB 500\n\nNemo Dat, Title and implied undertaking as to title\nFacts:\n\nMotor vehicle dealer had purchased car from defendant who did not know car had been stolen.\nDealer had use of car for several months and had on sold it.\nVehicle seized by police and returned to true owner.\n\n\nHeld:\n\ntotal failure of consideration despite dealer having had use of the vehicle for a number of months\n‘…there can be no sale at all of goods which the seller has no right to sell.\nThe whole object of a sale is to transfer property from one person to another.\nAnd I think that in every contract of sale of goods there is an implied term to the effect that a breach of the condition that the seller has a right to sell the goods may be treated as a ground for rejecting the goods and repudiating the contract notwithstanding the acceptance’ (Atkin LJ)\n\n\n\n\n\nPART A: Title – Rowland v Divall\n\n“Goods under the Sale of Goods Act – definition and types\n\n“Goods def” include all chattels personal other than things in action and money.\n\nThe term includes emblements and things attached to or forming part of the land which are agreed to be severed before sale or under the contract of sale.\nsoftware remains excluded from the definition of “goods” under the SGAs.\n\n\n“Future goods” means goods to be manufactured or acquired by the seller after the making of the contract of sale.\n“Specific goods” means goods identified and agreed upon at the time a contract of sale is made.\n\n\nTypes of Goods under the Sale of Goods Act 1923 (NSW)\n\nSpecific Goods\n\nParticular car with VIN\n\n\nFuture Goods\n\nContract to sell once existing\n\n\nUnascertained Goods\n\n100 tons of wheat out of 1k tons\n\n\nAscertained Goods\n\nOnce the 100 tons of wheat are selected and packaged, become ascertained\n\n\n\n\n\nUnascertained/Ascertained Goods\n\nThere is no definition in s 5 of unascertained goods, but they are goods which are not specific – ie not identified or agreed upon at the time of making the contract:\n\nRe Goldcorp Exchange Ltd (in rec) [1995] 1 AC 74, 89.\nFor example:\n\nGeneric goods sold on terms which preserve the freedom on the seller to decide how and from where they will be sourced;\nGoods sold ex bulk.

Some time later, King sold the relevant vehicle to a third party who sold it to the defendant (Skinner), who refused to return the vehicle. Dennant sued Skinner for return of the vehicle.\n\n\nHeld: the contract was formed at the time the hammer fell and the certificate entered into subsequently did not form part of that contract as it was made.\n\n\nRule 1: Bodlingo Pty Ltd v Webb Projects Pty Ltd (1990) ASC 56-001\n\nFacts:\n\nWebb sold its business to the plaintiff and the sale included identified office equipment and supplies worth $360,000 with the price was to be paid in 10 equal monthly instalments.\nBodlingo defaulted after 5 instalments becoming insolvent. Webb claimed that property in the goods had not passed and demanded their return.\n\n\nHeld: (per Handley JA) “In my opinion … the appeal can be decided by reference to broader considerations.\n\nUnder r 1 of s 23, and subject to a different intention appearing, where there is an unconditional contract for the sale of specific goods in a deliverable state, the property in the goods passes to the buyer when the contract is made and it is immaterial whether the time of payment or the time of delivery, or both, be postponed.\nThe agreement was unconditional. … the goods were clearly specific and .. were in a deliverable state. Consequently, subject to any contrary intention, the property in the equipment passed to the purchaser when the contract was made even though the time for payment was postponed… I am unable to discern any contrary intention.”\n\n\n\n\nRule 1: Minister for Supply and Development v Servicemen’s Cooperative Joinery Manufacturers Ltd (1951) 82 CLR 621\n\nFacts:\n\n(taken from CLR headnote) The Commonwealth let to S. Ltd. premises which contained machinery the property of the Commonwealth and permitted the tenant to use the machinery while negotiations for its purchase by the tenant were proceeding.\nSubsequently a contract for the sale of the machinery to S. Ltd. was entered into in terms of a document dated 3rd October 1946 which stated : ” Net cash before delivery. £3,243 Is. 8d… . Delivery obtainable from ” the leased premises. The purchase price was never paid. The Commonwealth, by letter, demanded payment of the price and stated that, if it was not paid, legal proceedings would be taken for its recovery.\nThereafter the Commonwealth obtained possession of the machinery by resuming possession of the leased premises. S. Ltd. proceeded against the Commonwealth for detinue and alternatively conversion of the machinery, claiming that the property therein had passed to it on 3rd October 1946 by virtue of rule 1 of s. 18 of the Sale of Goods Act 1895-1943 (S.A.) and, in the alternative, that the Commonwealth’s demand for payment of the purchase price acknowledged that the property had passed.\n\n\nHeld:\n\nThe effect of the term of the contract, “Net cash before delivery”, was that the property in the machinery was not to pass to S. Ltd. until the price had been paid.\n\n\n\n\nRule 1: “a deliverable state” Underwood Ltd v Burgh Castle Brick and Cement Syndicate [1922] KB 343\n\nFacts:\n\nthe parties had contracted for the sale of a “horizontal tandem condensing engine”, a machine weighing 30 tons that had been cemented to the seller’s floor.\nThe seller was in the process of loading the machine onto a railway truck when it was badly damaged.\nThe buyer refused delivery of the machine, and the seller sued for the purchase price.\nIt was held that as it was the seller’s responsibility to deliver the machine in a ‘deliverable state’, property remained with the seller who had to bear the loss.\n\n\nHeld:\n\nIt was held that as it was the seller’s responsibility to deliver the machine in a ‘deliverable state’, property remained with the seller up until the goods were placed safely on rail for delivery, so the seller had to bear the loss.\n\n\n\n\ns 23 Rules -\n\nRule 2 – specific goods not yet in a deliverable state\n\nS 23 Rules for ascertaining intention\n\nUnless a different intention appears …\nRule 2.

It provides protection to innocent purchasers who deal with agents selling goods on behalf of a principal, who:\n\nmay be acting without authority, where\nthat is just not apparent to the purchaser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nS. 28 - sale by Mercantile Agents\n\nSections 28(1) and 28(2) Sale of Goods Act dealing with sale by the seller in possession or the buyer in possession both refer to\n\n“…the delivery or transfer by that person or by a mercantile agent acting for that person of the goods…”\n\n\nSection 28(3) provides that ‘In this section the term mercantile agent means a mercantile agent having in the customary course of business as such agent authority either to sell goods, or to consign goods for the purpose of sale, or to buy goods, or to raise money on the security of goods.’\nThis exception applies where the owner has done something to make it appear that the mercantile agent has the right to sell and where the mercantile agent sells in the ordinary course of business.\nThe exception only arises where the buyer transacts in good faith and without notice of the fact that the person making the sale has no authority.\n\n\nSection 27: Voidable title\n\nSection 27 Sale under voidable title\n\nWhere the seller of goods has a voidable title thereto but the seller’s title has not been avoided at the time of the sale, the buyer acquires a good title to the goods, provided the buyer buys them in good faith and without notice of the seller’s defect of title.\n\nWhat is voidable title? If a contract of sale is vitiated by fraud or mistake or misprepresentation, the contract is voidable.\nAvoidance is a species of election which generally must be communicated.\n(Note though that a mistake which goes to the root of the contract is void and passes no good title.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperty in Goods\n\nLay- by\n\nLay-by def\n\nThis is a sale of goods where the price is paid by instalment and the delivery of the goods is delayed until the whole of the price is paid\nACL, Pt 3-2, ss 96-99\n\n\n\n\nSale of Goods Act (SGA def), ss 13, 14\n\nSection 13 Ascertainment of price\n\n(1) The price in a contract of sale may be fixed by the contract, or may be left to be fixed in manner thereby agreed, or may be determined by the course of dealing between the parties.\n(2) Where the price is not determined in accordance with the foregoing provisions, the buyer must pay a reasonable price.

Sons v Earl of Tankerville [1909]\nMorison v Lockhart [1912]\n\n\nTests and Elements\n\nThe case revolves around the interpretation of what constitutes “specific or ascertained goods” and the intention of the parties regarding the transfer of property.\n\n\nJudicial Opinions and Interpretation\n\nLord Harnworth MR rejected the construction of the contract suggested by the vendors, indicating the determination of merchantable timber was to be made at the time of felling, negating the agreement as a sale of specific or ascertained goods.\nScrutton LJ and Sargant J both held the contract did not involve the sale of specific goods as the trees were not identified and agreed upon at the time of sale, nor was the timber in a deliverable state until severed by the buyer.\n\n\nLegal Reasoning and Ratio Decidendi\n\nThe key legal reasoning focuses on the nature of the goods sold and the impact of subsequent legal changes on the contract.\nThe ratio decidendi is that the contract was not for the sale of specific goods since the trees could not be identified as merchantable at the time of the contract, and thus, the property had not passed to the buyers.\nAdditionally, the contract was held to be frustrated due to the impossibility of its performance following the enactment of the Latvian law.\n\n\nConclusion and Relevance to Modern Law\n\nThe appeal by the vendors was dismissed with costs.\nThis case highlights the complexity of contracts involving goods not yet ascertained and the potential for external legal changes to frustrate contracts.\nIt emphasizes the need to clearly define the terms of a contract and the circumstances under which property is considered to have passed from seller to buyer, a principle relevant in modern sales of goods law, especially regarding goods that require identification or extraction before delivery.\n\n\n\n\nSPECIFIC BUT NOT DELIVERABLE GOODS\n\ns 23 r 2 and r 3\nIf goods are specific but not in a deliverable state, property may pass once the goods have been put into a deliverable state and the buyer has been informed that the goods are in a deliverable state\nUnderwood Ltd v Burgh Castle Brick and Cement Syndicate [1922] 1 KB 343 (Court of Appeal of England and Wales)\n\n\nSALE OR RETURN GOODS\n\ns 23 r 4\nA sale or return agreement gives the buyer an election to buy.\n\nThe goods are bailed to the prospective buyer (see Chapter 3) who may elect to buy them or return the goods.\nUntil the buyer exercises the election to buy, the buyer is not obliged to buy and the property remains with the prospective seller\n\n\nWeiner v Harris [1910] 1 KB 285 (Court of Appeal of England and Wales)\n\nParties\n\nPlaintiff: Weiner (Manufacturing Jeweller)\nDefendant: Harris\n\n\nOriginal Dispute\n\nThe plaintiff sought to recover certain jewellery which had been pledged by Fisher (F), a retail jeweller, to the defendant as security for an advance.\nFisher had received the jewellery from Weiner on terms outlined in a letter, for sale or return.\n\n\nMaterial Facts\n\nFisher received jewellery from Weiner on a sale or return basis, as per a letter agreement.\nFisher was to sell the jewellery, entering transactions in a specific book, with property in the goods remaining with Weiner until sold or paid for.\nFisher’s remuneration was one half of the profit from each sale, with the requirement to remit the cost price and half of the profit to Weiner upon sale.\n\n\nIssue Raised\n\nWhether the goods provided to Fisher were on a sale or return basis, making Fisher a buyer with the right to pledge the goods, or whether Fisher was merely an agent for Weiner with no right to pledge the goods.\n\n\nLaw/Statute in Contention\n\nSale of Goods Act (SGA) s 23 r 4\n\n\nJudicial Opinions and Interpretation\n\nThe court held that the arrangement between Weiner and Fisher did not constitute a sale or return transaction but rather appointed Fisher as an agent for sale.\nThe terms of the letter, particularly the mechanism for remuneration and the stipulation that the goods remained Weiner’s property until sold or paid for, supported this interpretation.\nThe court emphasized that the mere use of the term “sale or return” did not define the nature of the contract; instead, the actual agreement and intended roles of the parties determined their relationship.\n\n\nLegal Reasoning and Ratio Decidendi\n\nThe key legal reasoning centered on the interpretation of the agreement and the roles it established for Fisher and Weiner.\nThe court concluded that Fisher acted as an agent with a duty to sell on behalf of Weiner, without ever becoming the buyer of the goods himself.\nThis decision was supported by the terms of remuneration, the treatment of the goods as Weiner’s property, and the nature of Fisher’s obligations under the agreement.\n\n\nConclusion and Relevance to Modern Law\n\nThe court’s decision clarified the application of SGA s 23 r 4 in situations where goods are provided for the purpose of sale by another party.\nIt distinguished between transactions where goods are given on sale or return (implying potential transfer of ownership to the recipient) and those where the recipient acts as an agent for the owner (with no transfer of ownership for goods unsold).\nThis case underscores the importance of clearly defining the nature of transactions involving goods to ascertain the passing of property and risk, relevant for determining rights and liabilities under the Sale of Goods Act.\n\n\n\n\nRe Ferrier;

Two days after the delivery execution was levied on the goods of F on behalf of creditors, and the furniture was seized.\n\n\nHeld\n\nI do not take the view that Mrs Ferrier retained the goods until November 20, 1941, within the meaning of [297] s 18, r 4.\nShe retained them until November 15, 1941, when, according to the trustee’s own evidence, the goods were seized under the execution.\nFrom that time on I think that the goods were “retained” by the sheriff, and were so retained until, pursuant to the order of the master, he withdrew from possession of them.\n\n\n\n\nDFS Australia Pty Ltd v Comptroller-General of Customs [2017] FCA 547 (Federal Court of Australia)\n\nJurisdiction\n\nFederal Court of Australia\n\n\nParties\n\nApplicant: DFS Australia Pty Ltd (Duty-Free Retailer)\nRespondent: Comptroller-General of Customs\n\n\nOriginal Dispute\n\nDFS Australia sought a “drawback” (repayment) of import duties for goods sold duty-free and exported from Australia, claiming to be the legal owner of the goods at the time of export.\nThe Comptroller-General contested, arguing that legal ownership had passed to the customers at that point.\n\n\nMaterial Facts\n\nDFS Australia sold duty-free goods in tamper-proof bags, indicating the goods were under customs control and warning against opening before export.\nTerms and Conditions required customers to export the goods within specific timelines or return them if not exported.\n\n\nIssue Raised\n\nWhether DFS Australia retained legal ownership of the goods at the time of export, qualifying for a drawback claim.\n\n\nLaws/Statutes in Contention\n\nSale of Goods Act 1923 (NSW) s 22, 23, 24\nSale of Goods Act 1896 (Qld) s 20\n\n\nJudicial Opinions and Interpretation\n\nJustice Burley evaluated the Sale of Goods Acts provisions and the contractual terms between DFS Australia and its customers.\nDFS argued the sealed bag regime and Terms and Conditions evidenced an intention that property in the goods did not pass until export.\nThe Comptroller-General argued that property passed to the traveller at the point of sale in the store.\n\n\nLegal Reasoning and Ratio Decidendi\n\nJustice Burley concluded that the sales terms, documentation, and the conduct of the parties indicated that property was intended to transfer to the traveller at the point of sale.\nThe contractual conditions set by DFS Australia were not seen as reserving the right of disposal until certain conditions were fulfilled but rather as an obligation to return the goods upon specified conditions.\nThus, property in the goods passed to the traveller upon sale, and the Terms and Conditions reflected obligations under the contract rather than conditions affecting the transfer of legal ownership.\n\n\nConclusion and Relevance to Modern Law\n\nThe court ruled against DFS Australia, finding that legal ownership of the goods passed to the customers at the point of sale, disqualifying DFS from the drawback claim.\nIt clarifies the application of the Sale of Goods Act regarding the transfer of ownership and conditions that might appear to reserve rights to the seller but do not legally prevent the passage of property to the buyer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUNASCERTAINED AND FUTURE GOODS\nThe concept of unconditional appropriation is distinct from the concept of ascertainment.\n\ngoods cannot be unconditionally appropriated unless they are ascertained.\nEven if goods are unconditionally appropriated to a contract, property will not pass if there is a contrary intention:\nproperty in unascertained or future goods may pass by the intention of the parties, pursuant to the general rule in s 22.\n\n\nUnder either method of transfer, unascertained or future goods must be ascertained before the property in such goods can pass: SGA (NSW), s 21.\n\nascertainment “by exhaustion”\nascertainment “by segregation and constructive delivery”\n\n\nThe passing of property by unconditional appropriation with assent\n\nUnder SGA (NSW), s 23 r 5(2), delivery to a buyer, or carrier or other bailee in order to send the goods to the buyer, is an unconditional appropriation so long as the seller has not reserved a right of disposal.\nCarlos Federspiel &amp;

Associates Pty Ltd v Riviera Marine (International) Pty Ltd [2001] NSWCA 281 (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Court of Appeal)\n\nJurisdiction:\n\nSupreme Court of New South Wales, Court of Appeal\n\n\nFacts:\n\nRiviera contracted to manufacture and ship a motor cruiser to a buyer.\nThe cruiser was damaged while being transported to the ship for export.\nRiviera claimed damages for the repair of the cruiser.\n\n\nIssue:\n\nAt what point did property and risk pass from the seller to the buyer in a scenario involving the manufacture and intended export of goods?\n\n\nHolding:\n\nThe court concluded that property did not pass until the goods were loaded onto the exporting freighter.\nThe arrangements and practices of the parties indicated that the risk and property remained with the seller until this final act of loading onto the freighter was completed.\n\n\n\n\nWardar’s (Import and Export) Co Ltd v W Norwood &amp; Sons Ltd [1968] 2 QB 663 (Court of Appeal of England and Wales)\n\nJurisdiction:\n\nCourt of Appeal of England and Wales\n\n\nFacts:\n\nPlaintiffs bought a portion of frozen ox kidneys which were later found to be unfit for human consumption.\nThe issue was whether the damage occurred before or after the property passed to the buyers.\n\n\nIssue:\n\nWhen did property and risk in the goods pass from the seller to the buyer?\n\n\nHolding:\n\nThe court held that property and risk passed to the buyer when the carrier, acting on behalf of the buyer, took delivery of the goods.\nSince the damage occurred after this moment, the risk was on the buyer, and the seller’s counterclaim for the price of the kidneys succeeded.\n\n\n\n\nCommon Themes and Legal Principles:\n\nUnconditional Appropriation:\n\nFor property to pass, there must be an unconditional appropriation of specific goods to the contract with the mutual assent of both parties.\n\n\nRole of Delivery and Risk:\n\nThe passing of risk is closely tied to the passing of property, typically occurring simultaneously.\n\n\nSeller’s Acts:\n\nThe final act performed by the seller, often involving delivery or preparation for it, is crucial in determining the point at which property passes.\n\n\nContractual Terms and Practices:\n\nThe intentions of the parties, as reflected in their contract and practices, play a significant role in determining when property passes, especially in contracts involving the shipment of goods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe passing of property by intention and ascertainment\n\nSGA (NSW), ss 21 and 23\n\nProperty might pass in unascertained goods otherwise than by unconditional appropriation.\nFor this to be the case, the goods must be ascertained and there must be a clear intention that property should pass.\n\n\nRe Goldcorp Exchange Ltd (In Receivership) [1995] 1 AC 74 (Privy Council)\n\nFacts:\n\nGoldcorp sold “non-allocated metal” to investors, implying ownership of gold as part of a larger bulk without specific appropriation.\nUpon insolvency, Goldcorp lacked sufficient bullion to meet its obligations.\n\n\nIssue:\n\nWhether non-allocated claimants had proprietary rights in the remaining stock of bullion.\n\n\nHolding:\n\nNon-allocated claimants had no proprietary rights over the bullion, as the goods were unascertained at the time of sale and no specific appropriation or mutual assent occurred.\n\n\n\n\nRe Stapylton Fletcher;

Second, if the seller’s title to the goods is defective, it asks whether the buyer has nonetheless obtained good “title” to the goods.\n\n\nExceptions to nemo-dat rule\n\nUnder the SGA, competing interests in the title of goods are resolved under exceptions to the nemo dat rule.\nExceptions to the nemo dat rule are set down in the SGA (NSW), ss 26-28, 5 and in the Factors (Mercantile Agents) Act 1923 (NSW) (Factors Act (NSW)), ss 5, 3. 12\nThose exceptions are:\n\n\n\nconduct by owner;\n\n\n\n\nsale under a voidable title;\n\n\n\n\nsale by a mercantile agent;\n\n\n\n\nseller in possession; and\n\n\n\n\nBuyer in possession.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 5 Definitions\n\n(1) “Delivery” means voluntary transfer of possession from one person to another.\n(2) A thing is deemed to be done “in good faith” within the meaning of this Act when it is in fact done honestly, whether it be done negligently or not\n\n\nCONDUCT BY OWNER\n\nIf the true owner of goods does not sell the goods, the buyer may nonetheless obtain good title if the owner has done something or failed to do something which disentitles him from asserting ownership\nSGA s 26\nRepresentation of apparent ownership\n\n\nRepresentation of apparent authority\n\nApparent authority\n\nAppears that seller has authority to sell\n\n\nApparent ownership\n\nAppears that seller truly owns goods\n\n\nThe critical question is often the scope of the seller’s authority to sell and whether the seller acted outside that authority with respect to the sale in question.\n\nMotor Credits (Hire Finance) Ltd v Pacific Motor Auctions Pty Ltd (1963) 109 CLR 87 (High Court of Australia)\n\n\n\n\nNegligent omission\n\nNegligence elements for omission to inform of right to sell\n\n(a) the true owner owes that buyer a duty of care to ensure that the seller cannot falsely represent he is the owner; and\n(b) the true owner has breached that\n\n\nThomas Australia Wholesale Vehicle Trading Co Pty Ltd v Marac Finance Australia Ltd (1985) 3 NSWLR 452 (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Court of Appeal)\n\nFacts:\n\nBarclays leased a Mercedes Benz to ICC, controlled by Kerr.\nKerr, without title, sold the car to Thomas Vehicle Trading Company, which later sold it to Marac Finance.\nICC defaulted on the lease, and Barclays repossessed the car. Marac sued Thomas for breach of implied condition of title.\nKerr misrepresented ownership and provided false information about the car’s financial status to Thomas.\n\n\nIssue:\n\nWhether Barclays, by their actions or inactions, owed a duty to Thomas (the purchaser) to prevent Kerr from misrepresenting ownership, leading to an estoppel preventing Barclays from claiming title against Marac.\n\n\nHolding:\n\nThe court concluded that estoppel by conduct can arise not only from positive actions but also from inactions or omissions.\nHowever, for an omission to lead to estoppel, the owner must breach a duty owed to the purchaser who bought from a seller without title.\nThe court found no such duty existed between Barclays and Thomas under the given circumstances, as there was no central register of motor vehicle hire purchase agreements known to both parties that could have established a duty of care.\nThe alleged breaches by Barclays (not controlling the car’s location, failing to require labels or marks, and allowing registration in Kerr Real Estate Pty Ltd’s name) did not constitute breaches of duty that could lead to estoppel.\nThe appeal was dismissed, holding that Barclays’ conduct did not preclude them from asserting title over the car because their failure to disclose their interest to Thomas was not in breach of a duty owed to him.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe case reaffirms the principle that for estoppel by conduct to apply due to an owner’s inaction, there must be a breach of a duty owed to the purchaser.\nIn the absence of such a duty, the owner’s failure to disclose their interest does not automatically preclude them from asserting their title against a buyer who was misled by a third party without title.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSALE BY MERCANTILE AGENT\nFactors Act (NSW) ss 3 and\nThe statutory definition of “mercantile agent” (see the Factors Act (NSW) s 3) is circular:\n\na mercantile agent is basically someone whose business it is to buy and sell goods on behalf of others\nMere possession of the goods by the agent is not enough to enliven s 5 of the Factors Act (NSW).\n\n\nSALE WITH A VOIDABLE TITLE\nSGA (NSW), s 27\nA person may buy goods from a seller who has the right to rescind the contract of sale, eg, for fraud, misrepresentation, undue influence or unconscionability.\n\nthe critical question is whether the original seller has elected to rescind the contract of sale before the subsequent sale to the subsequent buyer.\nUnless the original seller has elected to rescind the contract, title passes to the subse-quent buyer.\n\n\nCar and Universal Finance Co Ltd v Caldwell [1965] 1 QB 525\n\nFacts:\n\nCaldwell advertised his Jaguar for sale.

The vehicle had been inspected by the buyer and test driven by buyer’s mother.\n\n\nIssue:\n\n‘The question in this case is whether this was a sale by description or whether, as the seller contends, this was a sale of a particular thing seen by the buyer and bought by him purely on his own assessment of the value of the thing to him’ [at 255]\n‘I think that, on the facts of this case, the buyer, when he came along to see this car, was coming along to see a car as advertised, that is, a car described as a “Herald convertible, white, 1961”.\nWhen he came along he saw what ostensibly was a Herald convertible, white, 1961, …; it was on that basis that he was making the offer and in the belief that the seller was advancing his car as that which his advertisement indicated. Apart from that, the selling of a car of that make, I would on the face of it rather agree with the submission of the seller that he was making no warranties at all and making no contractual terms; but fundamentally he was selling a car of that description.’\n\n\n\n\nSale by Description – Grant v Australian Knitting Mills Ltd [1936] AC 85\n\nFacts:\n\nDr Grant purchased “Golden Fleece” woolen underwear but contracted dermatitis because a chemical remained in the material.\nThe Privy Council held there was a breach of implied terms of fitness for purpose and of merchantable quality but also discussed when goods are bought by description:\n\n“A difficulty, therefore, cannot but arise in determining when the sale is “by” the description and when not.\nApparently the distinction is between sales of things sought or chosen by the buyer because of their description and of things of which the physical identity is all important.\nWhen the ground upon which the goods are selected or identified is their correspondence to a description and when, therefore, it may be said that the buyer primarily relies upon their classification or possession of attributes, then, notwithstanding that they are bought as specific goods ascertained and identified, the goods are bought by description.\nIn the ordinary case of a sale over the counter by a shopkeeper to a customer, who calls for an article of a given description, inspects the specimens produced, and buys one, the transaction is a sale by description.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSale by Description – Ashington Piggeries v Christopher Hill [1971] 1 All ER 847\n\nFacts:\n\nMink food prepared to specifications of plaintiff.\nMink feed contained dimethylnitrosamine in herring component which was highly toxic to mink.\nIt was toxic to all mammals but mink were particularly affected.\n\n\nHeld:\n\nNo breach of implied condition as to correspondence with description.\n“The test of description, at least where commodities are concerned, is intended to be a broader, more common sense, test of a mercantile character.

in Grant v Aus Knitting Mills it was held that a buyer goes to a shop with the confidence that the tradesman has selected his stock with skill and judgment (better the shop easier it is to draw the inference)\nReliance is a question of fact\nPartial reliance is sufficient if it constitutes a substantial and effective inducement even if the buyer has to some extent relied on own knowledge etc\n\n\nFit for Purpose: reliance - Grant v Australian Knitting Mills\n\nGrant v Australian Knitting Mills [1936] AC 85\n\n“It is clear that the reliance must be brought home to the mind of the seller, expressly or by implication.\nThe reliance will seldom be express: it will usually arise by implication from the circumstances:\n\nthus to take a case like that in question, of a purchase from a retailer, the reliance will be in general inferred from the fact that a buyer goes to the shop in the confidence that the tradesman has selected his stock with skill and judgment:\nthe retailer need know nothing about the process of manufacture: it is immaterial whether he be manufacturer or not:\nthe main inducement to deal with a good retail shop is the expectation that the tradesman will have bought the right goods of a good make:\nthe goods sold must be, as they were in the present case, goods of a description which it is in the course of the seller’s business to supply:\nthere is no need to specify in terms the particular purpose for which the buyer requires the goods, which is none the less the particular purpose within the meaning of the section, because it is the only purpose for which any one would ordinarily want the goods.\n\n\nIn this case the garments were naturally intended, and only intended, to be worn next the skin.” (Lord Wright) (emphasis added)\n\n\n\n\nFit for Purpose: Trade name exception\n\nSection 19(1) ‘…Provided that in the case of a contract for the sale of a specified article under its patent or other trade name there is no implied condition as to its fitness for any particular purpose.’\nBaldry v Marshall Ltd [1924] All ER Rep 155\n\n\nFit for Purpose: Trade name exception: Baldry v Marshall Ltd [1924] All ER Rep 155\n\n‘The mere fact that an article sold is described in the contract by its trade name does not necessarily make the sale a sale under a trade name.\nWhether it is so or not depends upon the circumstances.\nI may illustrate my meaning by reference to three different cases. … …\nIn my opinion the test of an article having been sold under its trade name within the meaning of the proviso is: Did the buyer specify it under its trade name in such a way as to indicate that he is satisfied, rightly or wrongly, that it will answer his purpose, and that he is not relying on the skill or judgment of the seller, however great that skill or judgment may be?” (Bankes LJ)\n\n\nFitness for Purpose - Summary\n\nExpress or implied ‘particular purpose’ (ie given purpose) communicated to seller with sufficient particularity to enable the seller to identify characteristics with the goods need to possess to fit the purpose;\nGoods must be of a description (i.e. of a kind) that is in the course of the seller’s business to supply – not private sale;\nActual reliance on skill or judgment of seller (substantial and effective inducement) known to the seller?\nPartial reliance sufficient\nReliance determined by circumstances - Seller should have known in the circumstances that their skill or judgment was being relied upon\n\n\nMerchantable Quality: section 19(2) of the Sale of Goods Act 1923\n\nImplied condition that the goods shall be of merchantable quality\nSection 19(2) states\n\n2) Where goods are bought by description from a seller who deals in goods of that description (whether the seller be the manufacturer or not), there is an implied condition that the goods shall be of merchantable quality:\nProvided that if the buyer has examined the goods there shall be no implied condition as regards defects which such examination ought to have revealed.\n\n\nElements of implied condition:\n\nGoods bought by description (ie same as s 18);\nSeller commonly deals with goods of that description;\nthe buyer did not inspect the good before purchase, or if they did, defects were not such as would have been reasonably discoverable.\n\n\nSpeedway Safety Products Pty Ltd v Hazell &amp; Moore Industries Pty Ltd [1982] 1 NSWLR 255\n\nFacts:\n\nHazell was a distributor of Suzuki motorcycles.\nIt was put into receivership and was selling all its stock. Speedway agreed to buy all the stock.\nThe contract described the goods sold as ‘stock situated at the premises of 74-78 Wentworth Avenue, Sydney’.\nWhen Speedway received the goods, it found that some of them were unusable.\n\n\nHeld:\n\nNo sale by description – Speedway attended the premises and, after inspection, bought the goods ‘as is’.\n\n\n‘Of course what appears there is a description in the loosest sense.\n\nBut in my view it is not an expression which designates a general category, the membership of which implies certain attributes.\nTo classify the goods sold as stock is to adopt a category so all embracing in its extent as to predicate no qualities of its members.\nOn the contrary the memorandum adopts a form of language which merely identifies the goods sold by locating them at a particular address.’ (Glass JA).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMerchantable Quality: Hardwick Game [1969] 2 AC 31\n\nFacts:\n\nBreeding pheasants killed by being fed Aflatoxin tainted Brazil nuts.\nFeed suitable for cattle at a mix of no more than 5%.\n\n\nHeld:\n\n“It seems to follow that if goods are sold under a description which they fulfill, and if goods under that description are reasonably capable in ordinary use of several purposes, they are of merchantable quality…if they are reasonably capable of being used for any one or more of such purposes, even if unfit for use for that one of those purposes which the particular buyer intended…”\n\n\nWas the groundnut of merchantable quality?\n\nYes, it could have safely been used to feed other animals.\nThis meant that it could be sold on the market under the description ‘groundnut’, even if it was not fit for the particular purpose of feeding pheasants.\n\n\n“The learned judge analysed the evidence carefully.\n\nHe came to the conclusion that though the meal was unfit for use for one purpose (i.e. for use in a compound food for poultry) it could not be said that in the form in which it was tendered the meal was of no use for any purpose for which the meal (in its defective state) would normally be used:\n\naccordingly he could not hold that under its description it was unsaleable.\nThe learned judge had a great deal of evidence to consider and as there was evidence which warranted his conclusion I do not think that it can be disturbed.” (Lord Borth-y-Guest)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCammell Laird &amp; Co v Manganese Bronze and Brass Co Ltd [1934] All ER Rep 1\n\nFacts:\n\nShipbuilders order two propellers to be manufactured according to their exact specifications for two ships.\nOne propeller as supplied had vibration problems at specific RPM and needed to be replaced twice.\nIn all four propellers were manufactured.\nThe shipbuilders sued the manufacturers for breach of contract; the manufacturers sued for payment for all four propellers.\n\n\nHeld:\n\n[Goods are not of merchantable quality if they]…in the form in which they were tendered were of no use for any purpose for which such goods would normally be used and hence were not saleable under that description…the question is whether the defective propeller could be used…on any vessel\n\n\n\n\nAustralian Knitting Mills v Grant (1933) 50 CLR 387\n\n“In the ordinary case of a sale over the counter by a shopkeeper to a customer, who calls for an article of a given description, inspects the specimens produced, and buys one, the transaction is a sale by description.\n\nThere is in such a case a condition that the goods are of merchantable quality but a condition which, because of the examination, is qualified by the proviso to the sub-section and extends only to defects not reasonably discoverable by such an examination.” (Dixon J)\n\n\n“The condition that goods are of merchantable quality requires that they should be in such an actual state that a buyer fully acquainted with the facts and, therefore, knowing what hidden defects exist and not being limited to their apparent condition would buy them without abatement of the price obtainable for such goods if in reasonably sound order and condition and without special terms.” (Dixon J\n\n\n\n\nRelationship between section 19(1) – Fit for Purpose and section 19(2) – Merchantable Quality\n\nIn general terms\n\nSection 19(1) applies where a particular purpose is made known to the seller\nSection 19(2) applies even when no particular purpose is made known to the

the contract express or implied to that effect.\n(2) In the case of a contract for sale by sample:\n\nthere is an implied condition that the bulk shall correspond with the sample in quality,\nthere is an implied condition that the buyer shall have a reasonable opportunity of comparing the bulk with the sample,\nthere is an implied condition that the goods shall be free from any defect rendering them unmerchantable which would not be apparent on reasonable examination of the sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExclusion of implied terms and conditions\n\nSection 57 of the Sale of Goods Act 1923\n\n‘Where any right, duty, or liability would arise under a contract of sale by implication of law, it may be negatived or varied by express agreement, or by the course of dealing between the parties, or by usage, if the usage be such as to bind both parties to the contract.’\n\n\n\n\nConditions and Warranties in Contracts for Consumer Sales\n\nSection 64(1)\n\nAny provision in, or applying to, a contract for a consumer sale and purporting to exclude or restrict the operation of all or any of the provisions of sections 18, 19 and 20 (section 19(4) excepted) or any liability of the seller for a breach of a condition or warranty implied by any provision of those sections is void\nWarranty def\n\nWarranty means an agreement with reference to goods which are the subject of a contract of sale, but collateral to the main purpose of such contract, the breach of which gives rise to a claim for damages, but not to a right to reject the goods and treat the contract as repudiated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMerchantability and Consumer Sales\n\nSection 64(3)\n\nWithout limiting the meaning of the expression merchantable quality, goods of any kind which are the subject of a contract for a consumer sale are not of merchantable quality if they are not as fit for the purpose or purposes for which goods of that kind are commonly bought as is reasonable to expect having regard to their price, to any description applied to them by the seller and to all other circumstances.\n\n\nSection 64(5)\n\nWhere, in any proceedings arising out of a contract for a consumer sale (not being a consumer sale of second-hand goods), it appears to the court that the goods, at the time of their delivery to the buyer, were not, by reason of any defect in them or for that and any other reason, of merchantable quality, the court may add the manufacturer of the goods as a party to the proceedings and, if of the opinion that the defect should be remedied by the manufacturer, may make against the manufacturer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREMEDIES AND DAMAGES\n\nRemedies\n\nSeller’s action for price – section 51\nSeller’s action for damages for non-acceptance – section 52\nBuyer’s action for damages for non-delivery – section 53\nBuyer’s remedy for breach of warranty – section 54\n\n\nSeller’s action for Price s. 51\n\n(1) Where under a contract of sale the property in the goods has passed to the buyer, and the buyer wrongfully neglects or refuses to pay for the goods according to the terms of the contract, the seller may maintain an action against the buyer for the price of the goods.\n(2) Where under a contract of sale the price is payable on a day certain irrespective of delivery, and the buyer wrongfully neglects or refuses to pay such price, the seller may maintain an action for the price, although the property in the goods has not passed and the goods have not been appropriated to the contract.\n\n\nSeller’s action for damages – S. 52\n\nSection 52 – Damages for non-acceptance\n\n(1) Where the buyer wrongfully neglects or refuses to accept and pay for the goods, the seller may maintain an action against the buyer for damages for non-acceptance.\n(2) The measure of damages is the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting in the ordinary course of events from the buyer’s breach of contract.\n(3) Where there is an available market for the goods in question, the measure of damages is prima facie to be ascertained by the difference between the contract price and the market or current price at the time or times when the goods ought to have been accepted, or if no time was fixed for acceptance, then at the time of the refusal to accept.\n\n\n\n\nEffect of Seller’s Statutory Actions\n\nWhere property has passed to the buyer, the buyer has accepted the goods but does not pay:\n\nThe seller can sue for the price.\n\n\nWhere property in the goods has not passed and the buyer refuses to accept them:\n\nThe seller can sue for damages (not price).\n\n\nWhere property in the goods has passed, but the buyer has not accepted or paid for the goods:\n\nThe seller can sue for price OR damages\n\n\n\n\nBuyer’s damages for non-delivery – s. 53\n\nSection 53 Damages for non-delivery\n\n(1) Where the seller wrongfully neglects or refuses to deliver the goods to the buyer, the buyer may maintain an action against the seller for damages for non-delivery.\n(2) The measure of damages is the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting in the ordinary course of events from the seller’s breach of contract.\n(3) Where there is an available market for the goods in question, the measure of damages is prima facie to be ascertained by the difference between the contract price and the market or current price of the goods at the time or times when they ought to have been delivered, or if no time was fixed, then at the time of the refusal to deliver.\n\n\n\n\nAvailable Market – Joseph &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Harvest Grain Co Pty Ltd (1996) 39 NSWLR 722\n\nFacts:\n\nChickpeas bought for re-sale. Non delivery exposed the purchaser to liability to its own customers.\nAn issue was whether a buyer’s resale agreement was too remote for the purpose of damages.\n\n\nHeld:\n\n‘Available market then would seem to mean that buyers and seller are procurable at once and within a reasonable distance of the aggrieved party in sufficient numbers to constitute the relationship of supply and demand and the consequent establishment of a price.\n\n\n\n\nBuyer’s remedy for breach of warranty– S. 54\n\nSection 54 Remedy for breach of warranty\n\n(1) Where there is a breach of warranty by the seller, or where the buyer elects or is compelled to treat any breach of a condition on the part of the seller as a breach of warranty, the buyer is not by reason only of such breach of warranty entitled to reject the goods, but the buyer may:\n\n(a) set up against the seller the breach of warranty in diminution or extinction of the price, or\n(b) maintain an action against the seller for damages for the breach of warranty.\n\n\n(2) The measure of damages for breach of warranty is the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting in the ordinary course of events from the breach of warranty.\n(3) In the case of breach of warranty of quality such loss is prima facie the difference between the value of the goods at the time of delivery to the buyer and the value they would have had if they had answered to the warranty.\n(4) The fact that the buyer has set up the breach of warranty in diminution or extinction of the price does not prevent the buyer from maintaining an action for the same breach of warranty if the buyer has suffered further damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 8: Australian Consumer Law Part 1\n\nStructure and History of the Australian Consumer Law\n\nThe Australian Consumer Law (ACL) is a comprehensive regime to provide protection to consumers:\n\nwas the key recommendation of the Productivity Commission’s 2008 Review of Australia’s Consumer Policy Framework.\na cooperative reform of the Australian Government and the States and Territories, through Council of Australian Governments (COAG).\nThe ACL applies as a law of the Commonwealth under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) (“the CCA”), comprising:\n\nSchedule 2 of the CCA;\nThe provisions of Part XI of the CCA that relate to Schedule 2 and\nRegulations under the CCA relating to the ACL\n\n\n\n\nThe ACL is comprehensive package of consumer protection provisions which includes:\n\nGeneral consumer protections:\n\nprohibition against misleading and deceptive conduct\nProhibition against unconscionable conduct; and\na national unfair contract terms law covering standard form consumer and small business contracts allowing courts to declare them void.\n\n\nSpecific consumer protections:\n\nConsumer guarantees\nProhibitions against false or misleading representations and unfair practices such as pyramid selling, referral selling, harassment and coercion;\nProtections for unsolicited consumer agreements and lay-by agreements.\n\n\na national product safety regime\npenalties, enforcement powers and consumer redress options.\n\n\nThe ACL applies nationally and in all States and Territories, and to all Australian businesses.\n\nFor transactions that occurred prior to 1 January 2011, the previous national, State and Territory consumer laws continue to apply.\nThe ACL is administered by the ACCC and state and territory consumer protection agencies and is enforced by all Australian federal, state and territory courts and tribunals.\nThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (ASIC Act), provides for the same protections in relation to financial products and services as provided under the AC.\n\n\nThe ACL is not intended to cover the field:\n\ns 131C of the CCA provides that Part XI of the CCA “is not intended to exclude or limit the concurrent operation of any law, whether written nor unwritten, of a State or Territory.”\nAs a result, the ACL exists alongside other legislation (and the common law).\n\nFor eg: the Sale of Goods Act (“SOGA”) implies conditions and warranties, and implied terms as to title and quality of goods into contracts for the sale of goods that continue to operate alongside the consumer guarantee provisions of the ACL.\nThe main differences between the AAL and SOGA in relation to consumer guarantees:\n\nCover different transactions:\n\nSOGA applies to contracts for the sale of goods whereas ACL applies to the supply of both goods and services;\n\n\nImpose obligations on different persons:\n\nthe SOGA applies to sellers whereas the ACL also applies to manufacturers and suppliers;\n\n\nCreate rights in favour of different persons:\n\nthe SOGA creates rights in favour of consumers and non-consumers whereas the ACL provides consumer guarantees only for consumers as defined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the legislation protections under the ACL, Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW) and limited provisions of the Sale of Goods Acts, consumers can seek remedies under common law, or combinations of both common law and legislation to obtain redress.\n\nFurther, consumers may have resource to particular industry legislation, e.g. banking law for disputes between themselves and a bank, or credit law if there is a dispute over a contract for credit provision.\nAll courts and tribunals in Australia can hear disputes concerning the ACL.\n\n\n\n\nScope of the ACL\n\nChapter 1 – Introduction:\n\na single set of definitions and interpretive provisions about consumer law concepts.\n\n\nChapter 2 – General protections,\n\nwhich create standards of business conduct in the market, including:\n\nA general ban on misleading and deceptive conduct in trade or commerce;\nA general ban on unconscionable conduct in trade or commerce and specific bans on unconscionable conduct in consumer and some business transactions; and\nA provision that makes unfair contract terms in consumer contracts and small business contracts void.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3 – Specific protections which address identified forms of business conduct, including provisions:\n\nDealing with consumer transactions for goods or services\nOn the safety of consumer goods and product related services; and\nOn the liability of manufacturers for goods with safety defects\n\n\nChapter 4 – Offences:\n\ncriminal offences relating to certain matters covered in Chapter 3.\n\n\nChapter 5 – Enforcement and Remedies\n\n\nRegulations under the ACL\n\nRegulations made under the ACL are set out in Parts 6 and 7 of the Competition and Consumer Regulations 2010 (Cth)\nThe ACL Regulations give practical effect to the ACL provisions dealing with:\n\nprescribed requirements for asserting a right to payment;\nagreements that are not unsolicited consumer agreements;\nrequirements for warranties against defects and repair notices; and\nreporting requirements for goods or product-related services associated with death, serious injury or serious illness.\n\n\n\n\nOverview of the Consumer Guarantee Law in the ACL\n\nThe Consumer Guarantee Law is found in Parts 3-2, Div 1, and available remedies in Part 5-4 of the ACL.\nProvides minimum mandatory standards of quality of goods and services to “consumers” under s 3(1).\nDoes not apply to financial products and services under ACL and in fact not in the ASIC Act for these goods or services.\nThese are statutory rights and remedies, not implied terms into the contract as under the Sale of Goods Act.\r\nSale of Goods Act 1923 (NSW)\r\nAustralian Consumer Law\r\nImplied terms into contracts\r\nStatutory rights in respect of suppliers of goods or\r\nservices to consumers\r\nCan be contracted out of by express or implied\r\nintent – section 57 (except in consumer sales)\r\nCannot be contracted out of:\r\nsections 64 and 64A\r\nBreach = contractual remedies\r\nRemedies are statutory and wide-ranging\n\n\nRationale for the Consumer Guarantee Law\n\nThese standards were inserted to address the “information asymmetry” (see TradePractices Amendment (Australian Consumer Law) Bill (No 2) 2010, Explanatory Memorandum, p 607), between consumers and suppliers, given that consumers will ordinarily:\n\nBe less knowledgeable about the goods and services;\nUnaware of defects;\nUnable to bargain for a fair contractual allocation of risks of defects.\nThe statutory rights provide some redress for this asymmetry by giving consumers rights in the event that goods or services are faulty or defective\n\n\nKey Definition: Meaning of ‘consumer’\n\n‘consumer’ defined (consumer def) in section 3 of the ACL:\n\nA person is a consumer of goods or services if, and only if:\n\nThe amount paid or payable for the goods or services is 40,000 100,000 or less or as prescribed by the regulations; or\nThe goods or services were of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic or household use or consumption; or\nThe goods are a commercial road vehicle or trailer\n\n\n\n\nExclusions: does not apply where:\n\ngoods are acquired for resupply or manufacture or\nto services that are supplied under a contract for transportation or storage of goods for the purposes of a business or trade by the person for whom they are transported or stored; or\na contract of insurance;\nFinancial services or products\n\n\nThere is a statutory presumption that persons are consumers: section 3(10);\n\nRights of gift recipients:\n\nUnder s 266, where consumer acquires goods from a supplier and gives them to another person as a gift that person has the same remedies as the original consumer\n\n\nUnder s 2 “affected person”, in relation to goods, means:\n\n(a) a consumer who acquires the goods;

developed reverse piling (water marking), which was not disclosed to the buyers, rendering the carpet unfit for the agreed purpose and not of merchantable quality.\n\n\nMaterial Facts:\n\nThe appellant supplied carpet that developed an undisclosed condition of reverse piling, affecting its aesthetic purpose and integration with the decor.\nThe appellant was aware of the specific aesthetic purpose for which the carpet was purchased.\n\n\nIssue:\n\nApplication of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) concerning goods’ fitness for a specific purpose, merchantable quality, and correspondence with the sample.\n\n\nLaw/Statute in Contention:\n\nTrade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), particularly sections regarding goods not reasonably fit for their purpose, goods of unmerchantable quality, and goods not corresponding with sample.\n\n\nJudicial Opinions:\n\nThe carpet was deemed not reasonably fit for its specific purpose, considering the aesthetic importance to the respondents, violating relevant sections of the Trade Practices Act.\nThe phenomenon of reverse piling known to the appellant rendered the carpet not of merchantable quality when it left the appellant’s control.\nThe trial

failure to comply with guarantees as to good and/or services.\nRemedies and Enforcement Part 5-4 Div 1 Actions against Suppliers\n\nNature of remedy for supplier’s failure to comply with consumer guarantee in most cases depends on the seriousness of it – turns on concept of “major failure”.\nFailure to comply with a guarantee in relation to goods will be a major failure if\n\nthe goods would not have been acquired by a reasonable consumer fully acquainted with the nature and extent of failure.(s 260(a);\nGoods significantly depart from description or sample (s 260(b);\nGoods cannot be easily remedied to make them fit for purpose within a reasonable time (s 260(c) (d); or\nNot of acceptable quality because unsafe (s 260(e)\n\n\nServices – major failure:\n\nServices would not have been acquired by a reasonable consumer fully acquainted with the nature and extent of failure.(s 268(a);\nservices and/or product cannot easily be remedied to make them fit for purpose or\nServices create an unsafe situation.\n\n\n\n\nRemedies and Enforcement Part 5-4\n\nIf a major failure:\n\nconsumer may reject the goods or recover compensation for the reduction in value of goods:\n\ns 259(3).\n\n\nIf services, consumer may terminate contract for supply or recover compensation for reduction in value of services.\nA consumer may also recover damages if it was reasonably foreseeable that the consumer would suffer loss or damage because of the failure to comply:\n\ns 259(4).\n\n\n\n\nIf not a major failure:\n\nIf it can be remedied, the consumer may required the supplier to remedy within a reasonable time (ss 259(2)(a), 267(2).\nIf the supplier refuses, the consumer may reject goods and obtain a refund or have the failure remedied and recover reasonable costs from the supplier:\n\ns 259(2((b), s 267(2)(b).\n\n\nThere is also the possibility of damages for the loss or failure if it was foreseeable.\n\n\nRejection of goods\n\nS 262 – some limits to entitlement to reject goods.\nA consumer cannot reject goods if:\n\nConsumer fails to exercise right within a reasonable time (s262(2))\nGoods have been lost, destroyed or disposed of; or\ngoods were damaged after delivery; or\nGoods have become attached to or incorporated into other property\n\n\nIf a consumer chooses to reject goods the consumer must return unless significant cost in which case supplier must collect at its own expense.\nSupplier required to give consumer a refund or replace the goods (and guarantees apply to replacement goods.)\nthe possibility of damages for the loss or failure if it was foreseeable.\n\n\n\n\nRemedies and Enforcement Part 5-4 Div 2\n\nActions against Manufacturers\n\nA consumer can recover damages from the manufacturer if goods manufactured do not comply with statutory guarantees as to:\n\nAcceptable quality under s 54:\n\n(except where arising from act or omission by another; cause independent of human control after goods leave manufacturer’s control; where supplier charges higher price than manufacturer recommends or average retail price) (s 271(2)).\n\n\nCorrespondence with description under s 56:\n\n(as long as description was applied by or on behalf of manufacturer or with consent, and non-compliance was not as a result of act or omission of another or a cause independent of human control after the goods leave the manufacturer)(s 271(3) and (4)).\n\n\nSpare parts and repair facilities and express warranties (s 271(5)) –\n\ndamages include reduction in value from the lower of the price paid or average retain price and any other reasonably foreseeable loss or damage – s 272\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndemnification of suppliers by manufacturers\n\nS 274 gives a supplier a right to be indemnified by the manufacturer where the supplier has supplied goods to a consumer and is liable to pay damages under s 259(4) and the manufacturer is or would be liable under s 271 to pay damages for the same loss or damage.\nThe indemnity cannot be excluded, restricted or modified (s 276).\n\nHowever, if the relevant goods are not ordinarily acquired for personal domestic or household use or consumption, the manufacturer’s liability is limited replacement cost, repair or obtaining equivalent goods unless this is unfair having regard to the circumstances (s 276A).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct Liability – Part 3-5 ACL\n\nThis final part looks briefly at Part 3-5 of the ACL which is based on the former Part VA of the Trade Practices Act to provide remedies against manufacturers and importers of defective goods.\n\nIt provides compensation for consequential damage caused by defective goods, including property damage, personal injury and death, even if the injured party was not the consumer.\n\n\nAn action can be brought against a manufacturer in respect of unsafe goods giving rise to:\n\nloss or damage sustained by an individual because of injuries sustained from a safety defect (s 138);\n\nLoss or damage to another arising from such injury to the first person (s 139);\nLoss or damage to other goods of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic or household use from the safety defect (s 140);\nLoss or damage to land, buildings or fixtures from the safety defect (s141)\n\n\nSection 138\n\nLiability for loss or damage suffered by an injured individual\n\n\nS 139\n\nLiability for loss or Damage suffered by a person other than an injured individual\n\n\nS 140\n\nLiability for loss or damage suffered by a person if other goods are destroyed or damaged\n\n\nS 141\n\nLiability for loss or damage suffered by a person if land, buildings or fixtures are destroyed or damaged\n\n\nDefinition of ‘safety defect’\n\nSection 9 - Meaning of safety defect in relation to goods\n\n\n\n\nProduct liability general principles\n\nThere is no requirement that the injury must have been reasonably foreseeable.\nIf the injured person dies, the cause of action accrues for the benefit of the individual’s estate.\nIf another person suffers consequential loss from the injury to another caused by defectiv goods, that person can recover their loss from the manufacturer (except in the context of business relationships and if workers compensation applies, then Part 3-5 does not apply.)\n‘Goods” not limited to ‘consumer goods’ – s 2 – so includes ships, aircraft, animals, minerals, crops\n“Manufacturer” is also defined widely – s 7 – includes person who grows, extracts, produces, or assembles goods.\nUnder s 147 if the manufacturer cannot be identified and the supplier is notified and cannot identify the manufacturer within 30 days the supplier will be deemed to be the manufacturer.\nThe standard to be adopted in respect of the definition of ‘defect’ in s 75AC is an objective one based upon what the public at large, rather than any particular individual, is entitled to expect.\nS 150 – liability cannot be excluded, restricted or modified by contract\n\n\nManufacturers Defences s 142 - Defences to defective goods action\nRyan v Great Lakes Council [1999] FCA 177\n\nThe case was a representative action brought forward on the behalf of consumers who contracted hepatitis A after eating oysters harvested from the waters of Wallis Lake’ after the water had been contaminated by human faecal matter (which, in turn, contaminated the oysters).\nOysters were held to be “manufactured” under equivalent provisions of TPA.\n\n“[377] Section 75AC(1) explains that “goods have a defect if their safety is not such as persons generally are entitled to expect”.\nConsistently with what I have already said, it seems to me the elements stipulated by s75AD are satisfied in this case.\nHowever, s75AK(1)(c) provides a defence to an action under s75AD (amongst other sections) “if it is established that … the state of scientific or technical knowledge at the time when they were supplied by their actual manufacturer was not such as to enable that defect to be discovered”.\nThe paragraph obviously intends the defence be unavailable if the goods were supplied notwithstanding the possibility of discovery of the defect.\nConversely, the defence is available if the defect was not capable of discovery before supply.\n\n\nIn the present case, discovery and supply were mutually exclusive; the only test that would reveal the defect would destroy the goods.\nAccordingly, it seems to me the defence applies and the s75AD claim fails.” per Wilcox J\n\n\nGraham Barclay Oysters v Ryan [2000] FCA 1099\n\nHepatitis tainted oysters raise issues in negligence, sale of goods and consumer protection\n\nthen subject to the Trade Practices Act rather than the Australian Consumer Law which has parallel provisions.\n\n\nJurisdiction:\n\nFederal Court of Australia (Binding)\n\n\nParties:\n\nPlaintiff:\n\nGraham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd\n\n\nDefendants:\n\nRyan et al.\n\n\n\n\nProcedural History:\n\nThis case was brought to the Federal Court of Australia, centered around claims arising from the consumption of Hepatitis A-contaminated oysters supplied by Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd.\n\n\nOriginal Dispute:\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged they contracted Hepatitis A from consuming contaminated oysters supplied by the defendant.\n\n\nCurrent Reason for Trial:\n\nTo determine the liability of Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd for the distribution of contaminated oysters, focusing on duty of care and alleged breaches thereof.\n\n\nMaterial Facts:\n\nPlaintiffs consumed oysters provided by Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd.\nThe oysters were contaminated with the Hepatitis A virus, leading to illness among the consumers.\n\n\nIssue Raised:\n\nThe core issue was whether Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd owed a duty of care to the plaintiffs, if there was a breach of this duty, and whether the breach caused the plaintiffs’ illness.\n\n\nLaw(s)/Statute(s) in Contention:\n\nThe proceedings examined negligence principles related to the duty of care owed by suppliers of goods to consumers.\n\n\nJudicial Opinions and Interpretation:\n\nThe court scrutinized the operational practices of Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd, the foreseeability of contamination leading to harm, and compliance with regulatory standards in oyster distribution.\n\n\nLegal Reasoning and the Ratio Decidendi:\n\nThe decision focused on whether Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd had a duty of care to the consumers, identified any breach of this duty through insufficient safety measures, and established causation between this breach and the harm experienced by the plaintiffs.\n\n\nConclusion and Relevance to Modern Law:\n\nThe case highlights the critical importance of health and safety standards in the food supply chain, emphasizing suppliers’ legal obligations to prevent harm.\nIt reinforces the duty of care suppliers owe to consumers, especially in industries like food distribution where the potential for harm is significant.\nThe judgment contributes to legal precedents regarding supplier liability and consumer protection within the context of foodborne illnesses.\n\n\n\n\nCarey-Hazell v Getz Bros and Co (Aust) Pty Ltd [2004] FCA

on the valve.\nThe Court considered what was required for the manufacturer to establish the defence, namely that the “defect did not exist when the goods left the control of the actual manufacturer…“.\nThe manufacturer led evidence that at the point of assembly the valve was tested and checked by visual examination at 7x magnification.\nThe valve then passed further tests after rework before supply.\nAfter the valve was explanted, it was re tested, during which microscopic examinations did not reveal any abnormalities or defects apart from a blood clot.\nHowever, four years later (post commencement of the claim), tests detected a small chip on the valve.\nThe Court found that the “evidence of the examinations of the valve’s component parts prior to assembly establishes the likelihood that any chip present would have been detected”.\n\n\nThe defence was successful\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 9: Australian Consumer Law Part 2\n\nA: Misleading or Deceptive Conduct\n\nThe general prohibition against misleading and deceptive conduct and conduct likely to mislead or deceive under s 18(1) of the ACL derives from the former s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).\n\nThere is extensive case law on s 52 which remains relevant to the interpretation of s 18.\nThe general prohibition against misleading and deceptive conduct and conduct likely to mislead or deceive establishes a norm of conduct for the market.\n\nA person who has suffered loss by conduct that breaches s 18 is entitled to damages under s 236 of the ACL.\n\n\nThis Part provides an overview of the scope and operation of the prohibition.\n\nNote that it is also covered other subjects including Contracts, and Remedies\n\n\n\n\nSection 18 - Misleading or Deceptive Conduct\n\nSection 18(1) A person must not, in trade or commerce, engage in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive.\n\n\nThe broad reach of Section 18\n\nThe section has a broad reach. It can be relied upon not only by consumers, but also by commercial entities and applies to conduct of individuals, corporations and government bodies.\nThe general prohibition is complemented by prohibitions on specific kinds of conduct in ss 29-34 and 37 of the ACL.\nConduct must be “in trade or commerce”:\n\nConcrete Constructions (NSW) Ltd v Nelson (1990) 169 CLR 594 therefore excludes conduct not of a business activity, and merely private\n\n\n\n\nThe relevant audience\n\nTo assess whether conduct is misleading or deceptive it is necessary to identify its likely effect on the audience to whom the conduct is directed:\n\nButcher v Lachlan Elder Realty Pty Ltd (2004) 218 CLR 592 at [36].\n\n\nConduct may be directed to:\n\nthe public at large, or a section of the public, or class, such as through advertisements in connection with mass marketing of products, or\nspecific individuals.\n\n\nWhere directed to a members of a class “it is necessary to isolate by some criterion a representative member of that class”:\n\nCampomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd [2000] HCA 12; (2000) 202 CLR 45, [103].\n(selling Nike labelled fragrance in stores next to other sports fragrances was misleading and deceptive)\n\n\nThe ordinary, reasonable member of a class is expected to take reasonable care of his or her own interests.\nParkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd (1982) 149 CLR 191 (branding on expensive lounges was not misleading if you read the labels properly)\n\n\nWhat conduct may be misleading?\n\nConduct will be misleading if it has the capacity to lead into or cause error in the sense of a person being led to believe that something that is in fact untrue or incorrect:\n\nHenjo Investments Pty Ltd v Collins Marrickville Pty Ltd (1988) 39 FCR 546, 554-555..\n\n\n“[T]he question is whether in light of all the relevant circumstances constituted by acts, omissions, statements or silence, there has been conduct which is or is likely to be misleading or deceptive.”\n\nDemagogue Pty ltd v Ramensky (1992) 39 FCR 31, 41 per Black CJ.\n\n\nContext is important: eg advertising puffery.\nConduct need not be fraudulent, negligent or reckless to breach the section, and silence can breach the prohibition where there would be an expectation of disclosure.\n\n\n\n\nUnconscionable Conduct\n\nUnconscionable conduct deals with transactions between dominant and weaker parties.\n\nOverlaps with duress and undue influence in equity.\nUnconscionable conduct is prohibited both in equity and, more recently, by statute.\nThere are three key sections under the ACL relating to unconscionable conduct :\n\nUnconscionable conduct under the ‘unwritten law’ (section 20);\nUnconscionable conduct affecting consumers (section 21); and\nMatters the court may have regard to for the purposes of section 21 (section 22)\n\n\n\n\nUnconscionable conduct within the unwritten law – s 20 (see also s 12CA ASIC Act)\n\nSection 20(1) of the ACL states that ‘A person must not, in trade or commerce, engage in conduct that is unconscionable, within the meaning of the unwritten law from time to time.\nThe purpose of this section is to:\n\nWiden the range of remedies available to the victim of unconscionable dealing; and\nEnable the ACCC to investigate unconscionable conduct and, if necessary, bring legal action on behalf of the person who has been treated unconscionably.\nSection 20 does not apply to:\n\nFinancial services\nConduct that is prohibited under section 21\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin the ‘unwritten law’\n\nSection 20 appears to refer to the equitable doctrine of unconscionable dealing as it has been interpreted in case law:\n\nsee for example Commercial Bank of Australia v Amadio (1983) 151 CLR 447.\n\n\nHowever, the words are general and the courts have not yet settled on what constitutes unconscionable conduct under the ‘unwritten law.’\nIn ACCC v CG Berbatis Holdings Pty Ltd, the High Court accepted that s 51AA of the TPA (now s 20) applied more broadly to “manifestations of equity’s concern with unconscientious or unconscionable conduct” although it did not need to be decided.\nHowever it only applies if the other ACL unconscionability provisions do not apply:\n\ns 20(2).\nAs s 21 statutory unconscionability in the provision of goods and services is considered wider than unconscionability under the “unwritten law”, s 20 may have little work to do.\n\n\n\n\nUnconscionable dealing in equity\n\nEquity intervenes where one party has taken advantage of a ‘special disability’ held by the other where the defendant knew or ought to have know of the disability.\nCommercial Bank of Australia v Amadio (1983) 151 CLR 447 per Deane J at 474:\n\n“The jurisdiction is long established as extending generally to circumstances in which\n\n(i) a party to a transaction was under a special disability in dealing with the other party with the consequence that there was an absence of any reasonable degree of equality between them and\n(ii) that disability was sufficiently evident to the stronger party to make it prima facie unfair or “unconscientious” that he procure, or accept, the weaker party’s assent to the impugned transaction in the circumstances in which he procured or accepted it.\nWhere such circumstances are shown to have existed, an onus is cast upon the stronger party to show that the transaction was fair, just and reasonable…”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Disability in Unconscionable Dealing\n\nIt is a disabling condition which is “one which seriously affects the ability of the innocent party to make a judgment as to his own best interests when the other party knows or ought to know of the existence of that condition or circumstance and its effect on the innocent party.”\n\nCommercial Bank of Australia v. Amadio (1983) 151 CLR 447 at 462 per Mason J.\n\n\nIn Blomley v Ryan (1956) 99 CLR 327 Fullagar J said at 386:\n\n“The circumstances adversely affecting a party, which may induce a court of equity either to refuse its aid or to set a transaction aside, are of great variety and can hardly be satisfactorily classified.\nAmong them are poverty or need of any kind, sickness, age, sex, infirmity of body or mind, drunkenness, illiteracy, or lack of education, lack of assistance or explanation where assistance or explanation is necessary.\nThe common characteristic seems to be that they have the effect of placing one party at a serious disadvantage vis-à-vis the other.”\n\n\n\n\nUnconscionable conduct in connection with goods or services: 21 (see also s 12CB ASIC Act)\n\nSection 21: Unconscionable conduct def in connection with goods or services\n\n(1) A person must not, in trade or commerce, in connection with:\n\n(a) the supply or possible supply of goods or services to a person; or\n(b) the acquisition or possible acquisition of goods or services from a person;\n\n\nengage in conduct that is, in all the circumstances, unconscionable\n\n\n\n\nUnconscionable conduct in connection with goods or services: s 22\n\nSection 22: Matters the court may have regard to for the purposes of section 21\n\nSection 22 of the ACL provides guidance as to what amounts to unconscionable conduct.\nThe section sets out a number of considerations the court may have regard to including:\n\nthe relative strengths of the bargaining positions;\nwhether the customer was required to comply with conditions that were not reasonably necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the supplier;\nwhether the customer could understand any documents;\nwhether any undue influence or pressure or unfair tactics were used;\nand the price and terms on which identical or equivalent goods or services could be acquired from another person.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is statutory unconscionability? ASIC v Kobelt [2019] HCA 18\n\nFacts\n\nIt is unclear the extent to which statutory unconscionability is a broader concept than equity, and in particular, how it differs from unconscionable dealing in equity.\nIn ASIC v Kobelt Mr Kobelt ran a book-up credit system in a general store in remote SA where most of his customers were indigenous Australians, under which Mr Kobelt was authorised to access his customer’s wages or Centrelink payments and PIN for their bank cards to pay for food and make payments on second-hand cars bought on credit.\nThey had no other source of credit, most impoverished and illiterate, and the interest rate was very high.\nHowever, they entered the scheme willingly and it gave them access to credit.\nThe case concerned whether this supply of credit under the book-up system contravened the proscription of unconscionable conduct fixed by s 12CB(1) of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth) (ASIC Act) which is equivalent to s 21. The trial judge held it did; reversed on appeal.\nIn a 4:3 majority decision, the High Court found Mr Kobelt’s conduct did not amount unconscionable conduct\n\n\nHeld\n\nThe majority (Kiefel and Bell JJ; Gageler and Keane J agreeing) held that Kobelt had not taken unconscientious advantage of the situation – the system did not exploit the lack of education or literacy as most of his customers had a rudimentary understanding of the system so there was an element of choice.\nThere were benefits to them in that it protected them from family pressure to share benefits. Kiefel CJ and Bell J stated that, having regard to the parties’ submissions, the appeal was not the occasion to determine whether it was necessary to find a special disadvantage which was taken advantage of.\n\nKeane J identified that ‘unconscionable’ as identified in s 12CB of the ASIC Act relates to a level of exploitation and “victimisation of the vulnerable”. Gageler J noted it could be seen both ways but noted the lack of allegation of undue influence on the customers, no absence of good faith, and that customers could always cancel their cards or change the account into which money was deposited.\nThe implication from the majority is that by use of the term “unconscionable” the equitable concept of exploitation is still required.\n\n\nHowever, the minority held that Kobelt had engaged in unconscionable conduct.\nNettle and Gordon JJ identified the difficult nature of unconscionability, and the tension between the customers choosing to enter into the book-up credit system and the benefits of such a transaction system for them, in light of the customers’ vulnerability and the conduct of Mr Kobelt.\nEdelman J noted that the customers were largely “impoverished and often illiterate and innumerate Aboriginal customers” who do not voluntarily enter into the book-up system as suggested by the majority but are rather, given the “choice” to utilise the system and have credit or have none at all\n\n\nIn Kobelt, the question left unresolved was how far the notion of ‘systemic advantage-taking’ needs to go in order to constitute unconscionable conduct under Section 12CB of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001, especially in dealings with Indigenous customers.\n\n\nBut see ACCC v Quantum Housing [2021] FCAFC 40\n\nThe ACCC brought proceedings against Quantum alleging that the defendant had made false or misleading representations and engaged in systemic unconscionable conduct in breach of s 21 by devising a “Roll Up Plan” which pressuring investors to transfer the management of properties that qualified for the National Rental Affordability Scheme to property managers approved by Quantum.\nQuantum failed to tell investors that it had commercial links with the property managers it recommended.\n“This is an extremely important decision for all Australian consumers and businesses,” ACCC Chair Rod Sims said.\n\n“The Full Court has made clear that for conduct to be held to be ‘unconscionable’ under the Australian Consumer Law and other similar laws, it is not necessary to establish that the business engaging in the conduct has exploited some disadvantage or vulnerability on the part of the consumers or small businesses affected, although this may often be the case.”\n\n\n\n\nACCC v Quantum Housing [2021] FCAFC 40 (Allsop CJ, Besanko and McKerracher JJ)\n\n“Conclusion from Kobelt in the High Court\n\n78. From the above we reject the proposition that ratio or seriously considered obiter dicta of a majority of the High Court, indeed, of any justice of the Court in Kobelt (other than Keane J) requires in any case that for conduct to be unconscionable by reference to ss 12CB and 12CC of the ASIC Act (or ss 21 and 22 of the ACL) there must be found some form of pre-existing disability, vulnerability or disadvantage of which advantage was taken.\n\n\nThe notion of what is a “pre-existing” vulnerability or disadvantage as we described it at [36] above introduces a requirement that the so-called victim of the conduct brings to the relationship an attribute of vulnerability in some factor and to some degree.\n\n\nSuch vulnerability or disadvantage will often exist: as it did in the Anangu people in Kobelt.\nBut their Honours’ reasons in Kobelt (other than Keane J) do not express that requirement as a matter of principle as to the meaning of s 12CB (s 21).\n\n\nThe judgments of the Full Court of this Court and other intermediate appellate courts\n\n80. The judgments of this Court are contrary to the proposition that the taking of advantage of a special disability is an essential ingredient of statutory unconscionability. ”\n\n\n\n\nDamages under s 236\n\nSection 236 Action for damages\n\n(1) If:\n\n(a) a person (the claimant) suffers loss or damage because of the conduct of another person;

finance; domestic building; gyms; motor vehicles; travel; utilities\nThere is a presumption that a contract is a standard form contract – see section 27(1)\n\n‘If a party to a proceeding alleges that a contract is a standard form contract, it is presumed to be a standard form contract unless another party to the proceeding proves otherwise.’\n\n\n\n\nMeaning of standard form contract continued\n\nWhile the ACL does not define ‘standard form contract’, section 27(2) sets out the matters the court must take into account when determining whether a contract is a standard form contract including:\n\nWhether one of the parties has all or most of the bargaining power\nWhether the contract was prepared by one party\nWhether another party was required to accept or reject the terms of the contract in the form they were presented\nWhether another party was given an opportunity to negotiate the terms\nWhether the terms take into account special characteristics of another party or a specific transaction\nAny other matters prescribed by regulation.\n\n\n\n\nUnfair terms – exemptions\n\nContract terms that are not covered (section 26)\n\nTerms that set the price\nTerms the define the product or service being supplied\nTerms that are required or permitted by another law\n\n\nContracts that are not covered (section 28)\n\nMost insurance contracts such as car insurance, home and contents insurance, consumer credit insurance contracts (which may be covered under the Insurance Contracts Act 1984).\nNote however that some insurance contracts, such as private health insurance, are covered.\nConstitutions, including the constitutions of many superannuation funds, companies and managed investment schemes.\nContracts for the shipping of goods.\n\n\n\n\nRemedies – Who will enforce the law?\n\nThe following agencies will enforce provisions relating to consumer goods and services\n\nAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC)\nNSW Fair Trading and\nOther State and Territory consumer protection agencies.\n\n\nThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) will enforce provisions relating to financial products and services\n\n\nRemedies – Who decides if a term is unfair?\n\nOnly a court or the Consumer, Trader and Tenancy Tribunal can decide if a term is unfair.\nThe court or Tribunal must consider:\n\nWhether the term meets the three tests of unfairness\nHow the term was expressed in the contract. For example, it may be hidden in fine print or written in legalese.\nThe contract as a whole. A term that seems unfair may be reasonable if it is balanced by other terms offering benefits such as lower prices.\n\n\nIf a court or Tribunal finds that a term is unfair, it is void.\n\nThe term is treated as if it never existed and cannot be enforced or relied on.\nHowever, the contract will still bind the consumer and trader if it can operate without the unfair term\n\n\n\n\nRemedies – What action can NSW Fair Trading take if a contract term is unfair?\n\nNSW Fair Trading may seek the cooperation of business in removing terms that seem unfair but it cannot make a decision that a term is unfair.\nNSW Fair Trading can seek a declaration from the Supreme Court that a term in a standard form consumer contract is unfair.\n\nA declaration binds all parties to consumer contracts of that kind, unless the Supreme Court orders otherwise.\nA declared unfair term is void.\nA trader who tries to enforce a declared unfair term against a consumer is in breach of the Fair Trading Act.\n\n\n\n\nACCC v CLA Trading - summary of key principles\n\nACCC v CLA Trading Pty Ltd [2016] FCA 377 provides a summary of key principles relating to unfair contract terms (at [54]):\n\n‘(a) the underlying policy of unfair contract terms legislation respects true freedom of contract and seeks to prevent the abuse of standard form consumer contracts which, by definition, will not have been individually negotiated:\n\nJetstar Airways Pty Ltd v Free [2008] VSC 539 at [112];\n\n\n(b) the requirement of a “significant imbalance” directs attention to the substantive unfairness of the contract:\n\nDirector-General of Fair Trading v First National Bank plc [2001] UKHL 52; [2002] 1 AC 481 at [37];\n\n\n(c) it is useful to assess the impact of an impugned term on the parties’ rights and obligations by comparing the effect of the contract with the term and the effect it would have without it:\n\nDirector-General of Fair Trading v First National Bank plc at [54]\n\n\n‘(d) the “significant imbalance” requirement is met if a term is so weighted in favour of the supplier as to tilt the parties’ rights and obligations under the contract significantly in its favour – this may be by the granting to the supplier of a beneficial option or discretion or power, or by the imposing on the consumer of a disadvantageous burden or risk or duty:\n\nDirector-General of Fair Trading v First National Bank at 494 [17] per Lord Bingham, applied in ACCC v ACN 117 372 915 Pty Ltd (in liq) (formerly Advanced Medical Institute Pty Ltd) [2015] FCA 368 at [950];\n\n\n(e) significant in this context means “significant in magnitude”, or “sufficiently large to be important”, “being a meaning not too distant from substantial”:\n\nJetstar Airways Pty Ltd v Free at [104]-[105] per Cavanough J: Cf.\nDirector of Consumer Affairs Victoria v AAPT Ltd [2006] VCAT 1493 at [32]- [33];\n\n\n(f) the legislation proceeds on the assumption that some terms in consumer contracts, especially in standard form consumer contracts, may be inherently unfair, regardless of how comprehensively they might be drawn to the consumer’s attention:\n\nJetstar Airways Pty Ltd v Free at [115]; and\n\n\n(g) in considering “the contract as a whole”, not each and every term of the contract is equally relevant, or necessarily relevant at all.\n\nThe main requirement is to consider terms that might reasonably be seen as tending to counterbalance the term in question:\nJetstar Airways Pty Ltd v Free at [128].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfair terms and small business contracts - Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v JJ Richards &amp; Sons Pty Ltd [2017] FCA 1224\n\nFirst court action taken by the ACCC to enforce the small business unfair contract terms provisions.

The Act seeks to regulate transactions in order to create a comprehensive notice-filing system, but not to make one financing method more or less attractive than another.\nHaving the rigours of registration under the Act apply to these non-security transfers equally means that there is limited cost differentials caused by the Act as between any non-security transfer.’\n\nMcLaren, Secured Transactions in Personal Property in Canada (Westlaw) [3.01][B]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase Example: Re Arcabi [2014] WASC 310\n\nCoin and bank note dealer went into receivership\nCompany was in possession of hundreds of items - some held in its own right, some held for customers\n\nWere they covered by an in substance security interest?\nWere they held under a PPS lease?\n\n–Long term bailment, commercial consignment (s 13)\n\n\nGoods were held in storage by Arcabi\n\n–Goods purchased from Arcabi but held in storage by Arcabi for customer\n–Goods not purchased from Arcabi but stored by it for customer\n\n\n\n\nRe Arcabi - Bailment as a security interest\n\n[20] ‘There are several factors accepted by overseas courts as indicia of when bailment arrangements secure payment or performance of an obligation. These include:\n\na) the bailment provides that the ownership of the goods will vest in the bailee on expiry of the bailment agreement;\nb) the bailee has an obligation to purchase the goods or an option to purchase the goods or extend the term of the arrangement at a ‘bargain’ price such that it would be reasonable to expect the bailee to exercise the option;\nc) the term of the arrangement is for a major part of the economic life of the goods; and\nd) the minimum payments under the bailment amount to substantially all the capital cost of the goods.’\n\nIn this case, storage bailment was not covered by s 12(1)\nCustomers did not ‘regularly engage in the business of bailing goods’ and so s 13 did not apply to the bailment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRe Arcabi – was the arrangement a consignment?\n\nGoods held for customers pending sale was a consignment\n\nBut was not an in substance security interest under s 12(1) because it did not secure the payment or performance of an obligation owed to Arcabi\n\n\nGoods were not covered by a ‘commercial consignment’ (i.e. a deemed security interest) as s 10 definition not satisfied\n\n(customers did not deal in goods of the kind in the ordinary course of business; and Arcabi generally known to be selling as consignee)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPPS leases – section 13\n\nImportant to distinguish between a finance lease (which will come within s 12(1)) and a true lease (which won’t but may come within s 13)\n\nPPS leases are ‘deemed security interests’ under s 12(3)\nNot all provisions of the PPSA apply to deemed security interest e.g. enforcement provisions (s 109(1)(c)), variation of vesting rules\n\n\nRelevant factors in distinguishing between true and finance leases:\n\nAn automatic vesting of ownership upon completion of the lease term;\nAn obligation to purchase;\nLength of the term of the lease (useful life of the goods?)\nValue of the lease payments (total value of the property?)\nThe price of an option to purchase (nominal figure?);\nOnus to repair the goods?\nThe nature of contractual remedies available (if there is an accelerated payment clause or a sudden increase in ‘rents’ owed this reflects a financial remedy inconsistent with the existence of a true lease).\n\nSee Mirzai, (2011) 22 JBFLP 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase Example: Re Maiden Civil [2013] NSWSC 852\n\nCase concerned competing claims over 3 large Caterpillar vehicles used in excavation\nEach vehicle could be driven and had a VIN\nVehicles were acquired from a Qld based finance co (QES) in 2010, which itself had purchased the vehicles using finance from Esanda (for 1) and Westpac (for the other 2)\nMaiden paid QES’s financing costs + 10% fee\n\nMaiden retained possession of 20t vehicle once Esanda was paid off (and no further invoices issued). Maiden continued paying invoices on other 2 vehicles\n\n\n‘Leasing agreement’ was oral, really hire purchase\nMaiden obtained finance in March 2012, from Fast Financial - vehicles included as assets\n\nFast executed a detailed written contract and registered its security interest over all of the assets on the PPSR\nFast appointed receivers in July 2012 when Maiden defaulted - VA on 27.8.12.\nReceivers claimed the vehicles but QES purported to lease them to another and 1 of them was held by another company (Central) pursuant to a verbal agreement over a disputed debt (which was undocumented)\n\n\n\n\n\nMaiden Civil\n\nRe Maiden Civil\n\nCourt found:\n\nMaiden owned vehicle purchased from Esanda\nQES still owned remaining 2 vehicles\nNo evidence that Central had perfected security interest\n\n\nFast had a properly perfected security interest in the collateral\n\nMaiden as PPS lessee in possession of the vehicles could grant a security interest to Fast: at [26]\nCourt applied Canadian and NZ cases\n\n\nQES had a PPS lease - entered into prior to 30.1.12, but did not benefit from deemed perfection (transitional provisions) because not registered its interest on pre-PPS register in NT\n\nSee PPSA s 322(3), PPS Regs 9.2\nConflict of laws argument that Qld register relevant was rejected as vehicles located in NT\n\n\nTherefore Fast as perfected secured party defeated QES as unperfected secured party (PPSA s 55(3))\n\n\nSignificance of Maiden\n\nConfirms that overseas PPSA cases may be used to help interpret our PPSA:\n\n‘The Commonwealth Parliament, in enacting legislation that was modelled on the New Zealand and Canadian legislation, should be taken to have intended the same approach, which was by then well-established in Canada and New Zealand, to apply.’ at [32]\n\n\nConfirmed that priority between 2 PPSA secured parties does not depend on title: at [35]\nIn discussing the application of the vesting rule in s 267:\n\n‘The practical effect is that QES’s security interest is extinguished; QES has no further interest in the Caterpillars; and Maiden holds them subject only to the perfected security interest of Fast.’ at [72]\n\n\n\n\nRe Maiden Civil [2013] NSWSC 852 (Cont’d)\nProcedural History:\n\nThis case involves a dispute over the possession of several construction vehicles (caterpillars) which were the subject of various security interests under the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 (PPSA).\n\n\nOriginal Dispute:\n\nThe dispute centers around the rights to several caterpillars leased by Queensland Excavation Services (QES) to Maiden Civil, where ownership was to pass upon full payment.\n\n\nReason for Trial:\n\nThe trial was necessitated when Maiden Civil went into voluntary administration and subsequently liquidation, and the appointed receivers from Fast Financial Solutions claimed possession of the caterpillars, arguing that QES’s interest was an unperfected security interest that vested in Maiden Civil under PPSA s 267(2).\n\n\nMaterial Facts:\n\nQES leased caterpillars to Maiden Civil with a conditional ownership transfer upon full payment.\nReceivers were appointed to Maiden Civil by its secured party, Fast Financial Solutions, claiming a security interest created in May 2012.\nMaiden Civil entered liquidation, leading to a contest over the possession of the caterpillars.\n\n\nIssue:\n\nWhether the security interests concerning the caterpillars were perfected, and particularly whether Maiden Civil’s rights under the PPS lease were sufficient for attachment to occur.\n\n\nLaw/Statute in Contention:\n\nPersonal Property Securities Act 2009 (PPSA), specifically sections related to the definition and perfection of security interests.\n\n\nJudicial Opinions and Interpretation:\n\nJustice Brereton analyzed whether Maiden Civil’s possession under a PPS lease gave it sufficient rights in the caterpillars for a security interest to attach.\nThe court concluded that Maiden Civil, as a lessee, did have proprietary rights in the caterpillars, sufficient for attachment of a security interest.\n\n\nLegal Reasoning/Ratio Decidendi\n\nPPSA s 19(5) indicates that a grantor has rights in goods leased to them sufficient for a security interest to attach once they obtain possession.\nThis interpretation aligns with similar provisions in the New Zealand and Canadian PPS legislation, suggesting that lessees have a proprietary interest in leased goods that allow for security interests to attach and be perfected through registration or repossession.\n\n\nConclusion and Relevance to Modern Law:\n\nThe case underscores the importance of properly understanding and applying the provisions of the PPSA concerning attachment and perfection of security interests.\nIt highlights the potential vulnerability of lessors with unperfected security interests and the implications of the PPSA on traditional notions of ownership and secured transactions.\n\n\nFlowchart of Re Maiden Civil (P&amp;E) Pty Ltd\n\nLease Agreement Initiation\n\nAction: QES leases caterpillars to Maiden Civil.\nCondition: Ownership to pass upon full payment.\n\n\nCreation of Security Interest\n\nAction by Maiden Civil: Enters into a lease agreement under terms that constitute a PPS lease.\nRelevant Legislation: PPSA, Section 12 - Definition of “security interest” (interest in personal property provided by a transaction that secures payment).\n\n\nPossession of Caterpillars\n\nAction by Maiden Civil: Takes possession of the caterpillars.\nRelevant Legislation: PPSA, Section 19(5) - A grantor has rights in goods leased to them sufficient for attachment of a security interest once they obtain possession.\n\n\nAttachment of

Perfection requires registration or possession.\n\n\nBankruptcy and Liquidation\n\nAction by Maiden Civil: Goes into voluntary administration and then liquidation.\nLegal Consequence: Triggers concerns about the perfection of security interests.\n\n\nClaim of Possession\n\nAction by Receivers: Appointed by Fast Financial Solutions, claim possession of the caterpillars.\nLegal Argument: QES’s interest is unperfected and second-ranking, thus vests in Maiden Civil under PPSA s 267(2).\n\n\nCourt’s Determination\n\nFinding: Maiden Civil had sufficient proprietary rights in the caterpillars.\nLegal Application: Because Maiden Civil’s security interest (as per Fast’s claim) is attached and was possibly perfected before bankruptcy, it takes priority over QES’s unperfected interest.\n\n\nOutcome\n\nRuling: Receivers entitled to claim the caterpillars, overriding QES’s unperfected security interest.\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Mapping of the PPSA Based on Re Maiden Civil\n\n\n\nDefinition of Security Interest\n\n\nPPSA, Section 12: Defines a “security interest” as an interest in personal property provided for by a transaction that, in substance, secures payment or performance of an obligation.\n\n\n\n\nCreation of a Security Interest\n\n\nTransaction Involvement: A transaction must occur involving personal property where the interest is meant to secure payment or an obligation.\n\n\n\n\nAttachment of Security Interest\n\n\nPPSA, Section 19: Specifies the conditions under which a security interest attaches to the collateral.\nCriteria for Attachment:\n\nThe debtor must have rights in the collateral.\nValue must be given (by the secured party).\nSecurity agreement must be enforceable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRights in Collateral\n\n\nPossession and Proprietary Rights: As in Re Maiden Civil, the lessee (debtor) obtains proprietary rights in the goods upon taking possession under a PPS lease.\n\n\n\n\nPerfection of Security Interest\n\n\nPPSA, Section 21: Perfection can be achieved through registration on the PPS Register or by possession of the collateral.\nImportance of Perfection: Protects the security interest from claims by third parties and is crucial in bankruptcy or insolvency scenarios.\n\n\n\n\nPriority of Security Interests\n\n\nGeneral Rule: Perfected security interests have priority over unperfected security interests.\nCompeting Interests: The first to perfect or the first to register typically has priority.\n\n\n\n\nEffect of Non-Perfection\n\n\nPPSA, Section 267: Unperfected security interests may vest in the grantor (debtor) if they go into administration or bankruptcy, as was a key issue in Re Maiden Civil.\n\n\n\n\nEnforcement of Security Interests\n\n\nRights of Secured Parties: Upon default, secured parties may seize or otherwise enforce their rights in the collateral as per the terms of the security agreement and PPSA provisions.\n\n\n\n\nBankruptcy and Insolvency\n\n\nImpact on Security Interests: The status of security interests during the debtor’s bankruptcy or insolvency can determine the recovery of secured parties, highlighting the importance of timely registration and perfection.\n\n\n\n\nCase Application\n\n\nExample from Re Maiden Civil: Maiden Civil’s receivers, appointed by a secured party with a perfected interest, successfully claimed the caterpillars over the unperfected interest of QES, showcasing the practical implications of the PPSA’s provisions on attachment and perfection.\n\n\n\n\nCase Example: White v Spiers [2014] WASC 139\n\nSpiers agreed to sell earthmoving business to BEM in 2010\n2 agreements entered into:\n\nSale agreement\nHire agreement over equipment and vehicles worth $1.4m (BEM possessed and used hired equipment and vehicles)\n\n\nSpiers did not register it’s hire agreement under pre-PPSA law or on the PPSR\n\nEquipment and vehicles needed to be registered under pre-PPSA law (so no protection under transitional provisions)\n\n\nBEM granted security interest to NAB in 2011 (i.e. before PPSA)\nBEM entered voluntary administration and receivership in July 2013 (i.e. after PPSA)\n\nWhite was receiver of BEM\n\n\nSpiers claimed that receivership terminated the hire agreement and they were entitled to hired equipment and vehicles: who was entitled to equipment and vehicles?\n‘It may seem anomalous to say that the defendants’ interest in the Hire Assets is provided for by the Hire Agreement where the defendants owned the Hire Assets before the transaction was entered into.\n\nHowever, PPSA s 12(2) shows that the PPSA is intended to apply to relationships such as lessor and lessee and hirer and hiree under a hire purchase agreement, where the secured party already had its interest in the property before the security interest was granted.\nThe relevant issue in this case is whether or not the Hire Agreement in substance secures payment or performance of an obligation.’ at [18]\n\n\n‘The concept of being in substance security for payment or performance of an obligation refers to the economic or commercial substance of a transaction.\n\nTo determine whether the Hire

caterpillars.\nRelevant Legislation: PPSA, Section 19(5) - A grantor has rights in goods leased to them sufficient for attachment of a security interest once they obtain possession.\n\n\nAttachment of Security Interest\n\nCondition: Attachment of the security interest is contingent on the lessee having rights in the goods.\nAction: Attachment occurs when Maiden Civil obtains possession.\n\n\nPerfection of Security Interest\n\nAction by Fast Financial Solutions: Claims a security interest over the caterpillars, created in May 2012.\nRelevant Legislation: PPSA, Section 21 - Perfection requires registration or possession.\n\n\nBankruptcy and Liquidation\n\nAction by Maiden Civil: Goes into voluntary administration and then liquidation.\nLegal Consequence: Triggers concerns about the perfection of security interests.\n\n\nClaim of Possession\n\nAction by Receivers: Appointed by Fast Financial Solutions, claim possession of the caterpillars.\nLegal Argument: QES’s interest is unperfected and second-ranking, thus vests in Maiden Civil under PPSA s 267(2).\n\n\nCourt’s Determination\n\nFinding: Maiden Civil had sufficient proprietary rights in the caterpillars.\nLegal Application: Because Maiden Civil’s security interest (as per Fast’s claim) is attached and was possibly perfected before bankruptcy, it takes priority over QES’s unperfected interest.\n\n\nOutcome\n\nRuling: Receivers entitled to claim the caterpillars, overriding QES’s unperfected security interest.\n\n\n\n\nWhite v Spiers: Was the hire agreement a security interest under s 12(1)?\n\nYes (at [20]-[23]):\nTotal hire amount was agreed value of equipment\n\nMonthly payments paid off the price of the equipment\n\n\nOption to purchase by paying the market value\nHire agreement was part of a transaction to buy the business\n\nCondition of purchase that hire agreement entered into\n\n\n‘In substance, the Company purchased the Hire Assets by the payment of the purchase price by instalments over time, together with interest, and the defendants got security over the assets by way of it being a hire purchase agreement rather than a sale.’\n\nLong term hire

grantor does an act by which the security interest arises.\n\n\n\n\nSection 20: Enforceability of security interests against third parties\n\nSection 20(1) Security interest is enforceable against a third party if:\n\n(a) security interest is attached to the collateral; and\n(b) one of the following applies:\n\n(i) the secured party possesses the collateral;\n(ii) the secured party has perfected the security interest by control;\n(iii) a security agreement that provides for the security interest covers the collateral in accordance with s 20(2).\n\n\n\n\nSection 20(2) Security agreement –\n\n(a) evidenced by writing signed by grantor (or adopted or accepted by grantor);\n(b) contains description of collateral\n\n\n\n\nSection 21: Perfection (main rule)\n\nPerfection by registration, possession, control.\n\n\n\n\nDura (Australia) Constructions Pty Ltd v Hue Boutique Living Pty Ltd (2014) 292 FLR 11\n\nThe PPSA is aimed at establishing a “a single national law governing security interests in personal property”.\n\nIt came into effect on 30 January 2012.\n\n\nSome general observations can be made about the PPSA:\n\nsecurity interest def\n\nan interest “in personal property that is provided for by a transaction that, in substance, secures payment or performance of an obligation”\n\n\nSecured party def\n\nThe holder of a security interest\nthe person selling or leasing you the car\n\n\nUnsecured party def\n\na creditor who does not have a security interest\n\n\nTransaction def for PPSA\nDebtor def\n\nthe person who owes payment or performance of an obligation that is secured by a security interest in personal property\n\n\nGrantor def\n\na person who has the interest in the personal property to which a security interest is attached.\nMore often than not, the debtor and the grantor will be the same person.\n\n\nA security interest attaches to collateral when the grantor has rights in the collateral, or the power to transfer rights in the collateral\nperfected def\n\nwhen the security interest in particular collateral has attached to the property [17] and the secured party has either taken possession or control of the property or has registered it on the PPS Register established under s 147\nAKA the creditor (such as a mortgage lender) has established its priority in the encumbered property regarding other creditors.”\n\n\nunperfected security interests held by a secured party vest in the grantor upon the bankruptcy or the winding up of the latter.\nTransaction def and interest in personal property def for PPSA\n\nthe phrase, and the words that constitute it must be given their natural and ordinary meaning.\nTransaction signified that a security interest must be created consensually\n\n\n\n\nProcedural History:\n\nThis case was heard in the Victorian Court of Appeal, where Dura, the judgment debtor, and Hue, the judgment creditor, disputed over funds held in a joint solicitor’s account pending an appeal.\n\n\nOriginal Dispute:\n\nDura paid money into a joint account following a court order while an appeal was pending.\nDura then attempted to charge its interest in this money to an associated company.\n\n\nReason for Trial:\n\nUpon Dura’s liquidation, both Dura’s receivers and Hue claimed the money in the joint account.\nThe issue was whether Hue’s interest in the money was a “security interest” under the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 (PPSA), which would affect whether it vested in Dura upon liquidation.\n\n\nMaterial Facts:\n\nDura paid money into a joint account held by solicitors.\nDura charged its interest to an associated company.\nDura entered liquidation, triggering claims over the money.\n\n\nIssue:\n\nWhether the interest of Hue in the fund was a “security interest” under s 12 of the PPSA.\n\n\nLaw/Statute in Contention:\n\nPersonal Property Securities Act 2009 (PPSA), particularly sections 12 and 267.\n\n\nPrecedents Cited:\n\nInterpretations of “transaction” and “security interest” were considered based on previous case law and academic commentary.\n\n\nJudicial Opinions and Interpretation:\n\nThe court found that Hue’s interest was an equitable charge over the money in the joint account.\nIt was determined that Hue’s interest did not arise out of a consensual transaction but as a result of a court-imposed condition, hence not a “security interest” under the PPSA.\nConsequently, since it was not a “security interest”, s 267 of the PPSA did not apply, and Hue’s interest did not vest in the liquidator.\n\n\nLegal Reasoning/Ratio Decidendi:\n\nThe definition of “security interest” requires a consensual transaction, which was not present in this case.\nEquitable charges created by court order are not covered by the PPSA as they do not arise from consensual transactions.\n\n\nConclusion and Relevance to Modern Law:\n\nThe case highlights the interpretation of “security interests” under the PPSA and the importance of consensual transactions in establishing such interests.\nIt emphasizes the exclusion of court-imposed or non-consensual interests from the scope of the PPSA, which is critical for legal practitioners dealing with insolvency and security interests.\n\n\n\n\nHamersley Iron Pty Ltd v Forge Group Power Pty Ltd (in liq) (recs &amp; mgrs apptd)\n\nPPSA s 19 -

PPSA Part 2\n\nPersonal Property Securities Act 2009 (Cth)\n\nAttachment and Perfection – Steps to obtain ‘perfection’ of a security interest\n\nAttachment of the security interest – section 19\nEnforceability of the security interest against third parties – section 20\nPerfection by registration, possession or control – section 21\nNote: These steps can occur in any order\n\n\nAttachment of security interest – section 19\n\nImportant for rights\n\nBetween debtor and secured creditor (section 19)\nBetween secured creditor and third party (section 20)\n\n\nAttachment under section 19 only allows rights against grantor – rights against third parties requires more (sections 20, 21)\nNo enforcement unless security interest attaches to collateral (section 19(2))\n\nGrantor must have ‘rights in the collateral’\nValue must be given\n\n\nNote: use of floating charge terminology does not create deferred attachment (section 19(4))\n\nAttachment under section 19 is not the same as crystallisation of a floating charge\n\n\nSecurity interest over goods bailed or leased under PPS lease attaches when grantor obtains possession of goods (section 19(5))\n\n\nExample of Attachment – S19\n\nYou are the owner of equipment\nYou lease it to me for use in my business\nYou still have title but I now have possession and have provided value (the lease payments)\nI now have rights in the collateral and can grant a security interest to you, or to anyone else\nIf you don’t register your security interest first, and I grant another security interest to another lender who does register, in the event of my default you will lose priority to the second lender even though you still ‘own’ the equipment\nSee Maiden Civil case\n\n\nAttachment – S19\n\n\n\nThere must be a valid security agreement;\n\n\nIs about enforceability of the obligation between lender and borrower\nUsually about the inclusion of, and validity of, a contractual term\n\n\n\n\nThe secured party must give value for the security interest; and\n\n\nConsideration that would support a simple contract\nCould be the loan or a promise of a loan\nAntecedent debts satisfy the requirement\nNeed not be paid to the secured party\n\n\n\n\nThe grantor must have rights in the collateral\n\n\nMay be ownership (title)\nPossession may be sufficient\nException to the nemo dat rule\nFor sales subject to a retention of title clause s19(5) applies\n\n\n\n\nCase Law on Attachment\n\n‘Absent an agreement between the person who has the power to transfer rights in the collateral in return for value being provided by the transferee, the security interest cannot attach to the collateral.’\n\nDura (Australia) Constructions Pty Ltd v Hue Boutique Living Pty Ltd [2014] VSCA 326, [120]\n\n\n‘What is considered as rights in the collateral encompasses a range of interests beyond legal and equitable title…Without rights in the collateral then the nemo dat rule continues to apply and no security interest can be granted.’\n\niTrade Finance Inc v BOM (2011) 77 CBR (5th) 231, [44]\n\n\n‘It is not necessary that those rights be of absolute ownership, although it may be necessary that they be more than mere possession.’\n\nRe Gelpack Enterprises Pty Ltd [2015] NSWSC 1558\n\n\n\n\nAttachment – Rights in collateral\n\nLessee can grant security interest that results in greater rights being conferred on the secured party than the lessee had – that is, nature of security interest created can extend beyond the duration of original lease where a PPSA priority dispute arises.\n\nGraham v Portacom New Zealand Ltd [2004] 2 NZLR 528, [28]\n\n‘The rights of a lessee in leased goods [under the PPSA] are not therefore confined to the lessee’s possessory rights. As against the lessee’s secured creditors, the lessee has rights of ownership in the goods sufficient to permit a secured creditor to acquire rights in priority to those of the lessor.’ (applied in Re Maiden Civil [2013] NSWSC 852)\n\n\n\n\nImportant to identify role of title in non-PPSA priority disputes\n\nGray v Royal Bank (1997) 12 PPSAC (2d) 126 (purported sale of motorhome by rogue to purchaser who granted security interest to the bank to finance purchase – contest between non-secured interest holder as owner and bank)\nRSL Canada Inc (2006) 9 PPSAC (3d) 240 (condition precedent not satisfied so no sale took place, competition between non-secured interest holder as owner and bank)\n\n\n‘The issue is not ownership of the [collateral], but rather priority to it’ Re Giffen [1998] 1 SCR 91\n\n\nRights in collateral – Re Maiden Civil [2013] NSWSC 852\n\nIs the PPS lessee’s right merely possessory? What is the effect of section 112?\n\n‘…Maiden did not have only a mere right to possession under the QES leases.\nThe Canadian and New Zealand cases already mentioned demonstrate that a PPS lessee on taking possession of the collateral acquires not only a possessory right but also proprietary rights to the extent that it can grant security interests to third parties, so that the lessor’s interest if unregistered is vulnerable to being defeated by security interests so granted to such third parties.\nThe PPSA treats the lessee under a PPS lease as the grantor of a security interest with rights in the collateral, and the lessor as a secured party, because it sees the transaction as, in substance, a security transaction, though in form it is a lease.\nAs the cases mentioned above show, it recognises that the lessee may validly and effectively grant security interests in the collateral to third parties, that can take priority of the lessor’s unperfected interest, because the lessee is regarded for that purpose as having rights in the collateral.\nMaiden acquired possessory and proprietary rights in the Caterpillars upon taking possession of them, and granted a security interest in them to Fast under the General Security Deed.’ ([73])\n\n\nSection 112 (secured party exercising rights under Ch 4 limited by grantor’s rights) does not mean that if grantor’s lease terminated then secured party’s rights also terminated: at [78].\n\nFurthermore, Ch 4 would not apply because Maiden was in receivership (section 116).\n\n\n\n\nEnforcement against third parties (section 20)\n\nSecured creditor may enforce security interest against third party if:\n\nSecurity interest attached to collateral (section 19); and\nSecured creditor has possession of collateral (i.e. a pledge), perfected interest by control (only limited collateral can do this) or has a security agreement that covers the collateral.\n\n\nEffectively this means most security interests will need a security agreement that covers the collateral.\n\n\nRequirements for security agreements – section 20(2)\n\nSection 20(2)(b) the writing evidencing the agreement contains:\n\n(i) a description of the particular collateral, subject to subsections (4) and (5); or\n(ii) a statement that a security interest is taken in all of the grantor’s present and after-acquired property; or\n(iii) a statement that a security interest is taken in all of the grantor’s present and after-acquired property except specified items or classes of personal property.\n\n\nSee, e.g., Re Maiden Civil [2013] NSWSC 852, [39]-[40]\n\n\nPerfection rules\n\nSecured creditor must perfect their security interest in order to obtain priority\nMust maintain continuous perfection\nPerfection can occur by (s 21(2))\n\nRegistration (see PPS Register Podcast)\nPossession of the collateral (but not by seizing on default - see s 24 for definition of possession)\nControl of the collateral (limited categories of collateral only – most important is control of ADI account ss 25, 57, 75).\n\n\nIn addition, attachment must occur (s 19) and secured party must have rights against third parties (s 21(1))\nAttachment and registration can occur in any order (s 161), but priority does not arise until both occur, that is, until perfection\nMultiple transactions can be perfected by a single registration (called a financing statement) – but must be same collateral class\nNote: special temporary perfection rules (s 33)\n\nOther special rules for transferred and returned collateral\n\n\n\n\nAttachment and Perfection\n\n‘Security interests are effective and enforceable against grantors where those interests have attached to the collateral that is the subject of the interest; they are enforceable against third parties where they have been perfected.’\nDura (Australia) Constructions Pty Ltd v Hue Boutique Living Pty Ltd [2014] VSCA 326, [17]\n\n\nWhy is perfection important?\n\nThe idea behind ‘perfecting’ a security interest is essentially to put the world at large on notice of all existing security interests over personal property.\nThe PPSA deals with the problem of apparent ownership.\nPerfection is important for at least two reasons:\n\nSubsequent creditors can make an informed decision regarding whether to advance further funds to a particular party or not;\nEnd users of property (i.e. purchasers, lessees etc) can find out if property is otherwise encumbered\n\n\nIf you are putting all prudent third party searchers on notice of your existing security interest it follows that you should be entitled to retain priority from the time perfection is satisfied (provided the perfection is valid and effective).\n\n\nFailure to maintain perfection\n\nA failure to continuously maintain perfected status can result in extinguishment of security\n\nApplication of the taking free rules in Pt 2.5\n\nSection 43 - sale or lease of unperfected security interest\nSection 46 - sale or lease in ordinary course of business – See Warehouse Sales [2014] VSC 644, [78]-[111] for meaning of ‘ordinary course of business’.\nSection 47 - sale or lease under $5k for personal, domestic, household purpose\nSections 44, 45 – serial number property\nEffect of taking free is to surrogate secured party into position of transferor (section 53(2))\n\n\nThe secured party’s security interest ‘vesting in the grantor’ if the grantor:\n\nGoes into liquidation, voluntary administration or personal bankruptcy (section 267)\nLate registration

reason of their status as the ADI\nKnauf Plasterboard Pty Ltd v Plasterboard West Pty Ltd (in liq) (recs &amp; mgrs apptd)\n\nAppointment of receivers and perfection of security interest\n\nThe court concluded that the receivers did have possession but found that that possession was by way of seizure, which is expressly excluded under PPSA, s 21\n\n\nIf the words “affected by” are to be given any sensible interpretation, they must contemplate the expansion or contraction of the meaning that would otherwise be applicable.\nIt would not be possible to perfect a security interest in an intangible by possession.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFailing to perfect does not affect secured party rights against grantor, unless vesting occurs.\nRights between secured party and grantor established by attachment (s 19).\nFailing to perfect will affect priority contests between multiple secured parties in same collateral.\n\n\nProblems with perfection\n\nNeed for an effective continuous registration (section 56)\n\nPerfection by possession lost if possession lost\nPossible to possess and register\n\n\nRegistration may be defective (section 164)\n\nSeriously misleading defect\n\nDefect – search of register would not produce a result\nFuture Revelation Ltd v Medica Radiology &amp; Nuclear Medicine Pty Ltd [2013] NSWSC 1741, [6] (Secured party’s ACN wrong)\nPrescribed defects (section 164(1)(b), section 165)\n\n\n\n\nEven if not a defect under section 164, a failure to correctly register may result in no registration being effective and the application of the taking free rules.\n\n\nDefault Priority Rules (section 55)\n\nKnowledge of prior interest is largely irrelevant\n\nPriority not based on actual or constructive knowledge\nSome taking free rules recognise knowledge as exception (e.g. s 47(2)(b))\n\n\nPerfected security interest beats unperfected (s 55(3))\n\nLater created security interest may beat a prior interest by perfecting (e.g. registering) first\n\n\nUnperfected interests are determined by order of attachment (s 55(2))\nPriority between security interests determined by earliest ‘priority time’ (ss 55(4),(5))\n\nRegistration; (even if registration occurs prior to attachment – s 161)\nPerfection by registration or control; or\nTemporary perfection (e.g. by transfer of collateral)\n\n\nPriority time must remain ‘continuously perfected’ until enforcement (see s

disposal giving rise to proceeds\n\nSee also ‘transfer rule’ s 34 (temporary perfection)\n\n\nSecurity interest will attach to proceeds (s 32)\nPerfection against proceeds if registration\n\nIncludes

perfection for five business days otherwise (s 33(2))\n\n\nProceeds are defined in s 31\n\n\nPriority Rules – PPSA v Non-PPSA Interests\n\nDetermined by section 73\n\nSpecial priority for general liens arising in relation to the provision of goods or services (s 73(1))\nDetermined by a statute (s 73(2))\nDetermined by ministerial declaration (s 73(3))\n\n\nCanadian cases have held that where there is no statutory rule the general law first in time rule applies.\n\n\nPriority of PMSI\n\nPerfected PMSI will generally take priority over other security interests (except those perfected by control or over accounts for new value (ss 57, 64, 75)\nRegistration of financing statement must state that security interest is a PMSI\n\nPMSI over goods held as inventory (s 62(2)): Perfection by registration must be done before grantor takes possession of goods.\nPMSI over goods not held as inventory (s 62(3)): Within 15 days after the grantor takes possession of goods\nConstructive possession does not operate – see s 24\n\n\nClaiming PMSI status is a serious defect in a financing statement if the security interest is not a PMSI to any extent (s 165(c))\n\n\nReminder – what is a PMSI def?\n\nSection 14(1)\n\n(a) a security interest taken in collateral, to the extent that it secures all or part of its purchase price;\n(b) a security interest taken in collateral by a person who gives value for the purpose of enabling the grantor to acquire rights in the collateral, to the extent that the value is applied to acquire those rights;\n(c) the interest of a lessor or bailor of goods under a PPS lease;\n(d) the interest of a consignor who delivers goods to a consigned under a commercial consignment.\n\n\nIf security includes PMSI and non-PMSI, then PMSI only to the extent that s 14(1) satisfied (ss 14(3), (4))\nExclusions from PMSI (s 14(2)):\n\nSale and leaseback\nInterest in special collateral (chattel paper, investment instrument, monetary obligation etc)\nSecurity

for value, takes the personal property free of an unperfected security interest in the property” unless they are a party to the transaction by which the security interest was created.\n\n\nSerial numbered property:\n\nUnder s 44 a buyer or lessee of personal property takes the personal property free of a security interest in the property the serial number incorrect or missing.\nException:\n\nwhere the buyer or lessor takes the personal property as inventory.\n\n\n\n\nMotor vehicles generally:\n\nThe “day and a half rule” A purchaser who searches the register at any time between the start of the previous day (that is the day before the sale) and the time of the sale takes free of a security interest that was not revealed by a search for the serial number.\nA buyer or lessee for value will also take free of security interests if they buy from a dealer in the state in which the transaction takes place whether or not the security interest is registered.\nThese exceptions do not apply if the buyer had actual or constructive notice of the existence of the security interest and so if the buyer does actually search and finds the registration of the security they can’t then continue with their purchase and take free.\n\n\n\n\nTaking Free Provisions\n\nOrdinary course of business.\n\ns46 (1) states that a “buyer or lessee of personal property takes the personal property free of a security interest given by the seller or lessor, or that arises under section 32 (proceeds—attachment), if the personal property was sold or leased in the ordinary course of the seller’s or lessor’s business of selling or leasing personal property of that kind.”\n\n\nPersonal domestic or household property.\n\nPurchases of this type for a value of less than $5,000 will not be affected by a security interest (s47) nor will a holder of currency (s48) unless, in either case the purchaser has actual or constructive notice of the security interest.\nIn this context, constructive notice does not mean that they would have found the security interest had they actually searched the register.\n\n\ns300 Registration of data does not constitute constructive notice\nA person does not have notice, or actual or constructive knowledge, about the existence or contents of a registration merely because data in the registration is available for search in the register\nRe Renovation Boys [2014] NSWSC 340\n\n\nTaking Free Provisions\n\nInvestment instruments and intermediated securities: ss49 - 51 provides that “a person who buys an investment instrument or an intermediated security in the ordinary course of trading takes the instrument or intermediated security free of a security interest”.\nThis exception is also subject to the requirement that the purchaser not have notice that the purchase is in breach of the security interest\n\n\nAccessions and Comingling\n\nAccessions are goods that “are installed in or affixed to, other goods” unless the other goods are required or permitted by the regulations to be described by unique serial number.\n\nFor example, an engine installed in a motor vehicle is an accession because the engine is physically attached to the motor vehicle and only the car is described by a unique serial number.” (PPS Bill EM)\n\n\nDefault rule:\n\ns88 “A security interest in goods that become an accession to other goods continues in the accession”\n\n\nDefault priority rule:\n\ns89 ” a security interest in goods that is attached at the time when the goods become an accession has priority over a claim to the goods as an accession made by a person with an interest in the whole”\n\n\nNo priority where the secured party to the accession has not perfected its security interest in the accession at the time it became affixed to the whole.\n\n\nExample PPS Bill explanatory memorandum – accessions and comingling\n\n“Grant A borrows money from Finance B to buy a new motor for its pump which is placed into the pump.\nBefore Finance B registers its security interest in the motor on the PPS Register, Grant A offers the pump as security for a loan from Bank A, which advances the money and perfects its security interest in the pump through registration.\nBank A has priority over Finance B to the motor because Bank A acquired for value an interest in the whole (the pump) before the security interest in the accession (the motor) was perfected.\nBank A’s search of the register would not have disclosed Finance B’s security interest, and Bank A was entitled to assume that its perfected security interest would have the highest priority of any security interest attached to the pump”\n\n\nComingling\n\nDefault rule: s100;\n\nA security interest continues in goods which are “manufactured, processed, assembled or comingled so that they become part of a product of mass and their separate identity is lost in the product or mass (s99).\n\n\n“any priority that a security interest continuing in the product or mass has over another security interest in the product or mass is limited to the value of the goods on the day on which they became part of the product or mass”\nWhere there is more than one perfected security interest in the product or mass then s 102(2) applies:\n\n102(2) If more than one perfected security interest continues in the same product or mass, each perfected security interest is entitled to share in the product or mass according to the ratio that the obligation secured by the perfected security interest bears to the sum of the obligations secured by all perfected security interests in the same product or mass\n\n\n\n\nAttachment to Proceeds of Sale\n\nS 30 defines proceeds as:\n\nProceeds of collateral are identifiable or traceable personal property that is derived from dealings with the collateral.\nProceeds also includes certain insurance or indemnity rights, payments in redemption of certain intangible collateral, certain rights of licensors of intellectual property, and certain rights relating to investment instruments and intermediated securities\n\n\nA security interest in collateral continues in the proceeds (except in certain cases).\n31(2):\n\n“proceeds are traceable whether or not there is a fiduciary relationship between the person who has a security interest in the proceeds, as provided in section 32, and the person who has rights in or has dealt with the proceeds”.\n\n\n\n\nAttachment to proceeds of sale\n\nGeneral rule about attachment of proceeds:\n\ns 32 “if collateral gives rise to proceeds (by being dealt with or otherwise), the security interest continues in the collateral unless:\n\nthe secured party expressly or impliedly authorised a disposal giving rise to the proceeds; or\nthe secured party expressly or impliedly agreed that a dealing giving rise to the proceeds would extinguish the security interest; and\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent Development of PPSA – PPS Lease Change 2017\n\nIn May 2017, there was a change to the legislation regarding PPS leases\nThe Personal Property Securities Amendment (PPS Leases) Act 2017 (Cth) which commenced on 20 May 2017 revised the concept of a PPS Lease under s 13.\nThe Amendment Act extends the period that leases and bailments need to have before they will be PPS Leases under the PPSA.\nThe minimum duration of PPS Leases has been extended from more than one year, to more than two years.\nLeases of an indefinite term will not be deemed to be PPS Leases unless and until they ‘run’ for a period of more than two years.\nThis change does not affect agreements entered into prior to 20 May 2017\nFor leases and bailments entered into prior to the changes, the law remains unchanged and registrations should proceed for these leases and bailments as usual.\n\n\nRecent Development of PPSA – ABN v ACN in registration\n\nSection 153 of PPSA requires a financing statement to include the grantor’s details as prescribed by the PPS Regulations 2010.\n\nClause 1.3 of Schedule 1 of the PPS Regulations provides that where the grantor is a body corporate that has an ACN, the financing statement must refer to the grantor’s ACN.\nSections 164(1)(b) and 165(b) of the PPSA provide that a registration is ineffective if a search of the grantor’s details on the PPSR is not capable of disclosing the registration.\n\n\nWhile many businesses now understand the importance of registering their rights on the PPSR, errors remain common.\nSome of these errors can be fatal and result in the loss of assets.\nOn 31 January 2017, the NSW Supreme Court confirmed that an administrative error made in PPSR registration would result in the loss of a $23m ore crusher\n\nThe error was simple – Alleasing had registered over its customer’s ABN rather than its ACN.\nSee OneSteel Manufacturing Pty Ltd (administrators appointed) [2017] NSWSC 21\n\n\n\n\nHamersly Iron Pty Ltd v Forge Group Power Pty Ltd [2018] WASCA 163\n\nAttachment and it’s impact\nThe court concluded that the attachment of the security interest precluded mutuality\n\noverturned on appeal by reason of the Court of Appeal’s interpretation of the operation of particular provisions in the security agreement\n\n\nWASCA Found that\n\n… the attachment of a security interest in collateral, as provided for by s 19 of the PPSA, confers on the secured party a proprietary interest in the collateral at the time of attachment; …\n… the concept of crystallisation of a floating charge is rendered redundant by the PPSA\n\n\nJurisdiction and Context\n\nCourt: Supreme Court of Western Australia\nRelevance: This case is pivotal in understanding the application of the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 (Cth) (PPSA) in determining the rights of secured creditors and the treatment of set-off claims in insolvency contexts.\n\n\nParties\n\nPlaintiff: Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd\nDefendant: Forge Group Power Pty Ltd (in liquidation)\n\n\nProcedural History\n\nThis case arises from the insolvency proceedings of Forge Group Power Pty Ltd, where cross-claims existed between Hamersley and Forge based on previous contractual dealings.\n\n\nOriginal Dispute\n\nBoth parties had claims against each other arising from contracts entered into in 2012.\nThe complication arose with Forge’s insolvency, where different claims needed to be reconciled and set off.\n\n\nCurrent Trial Issue\n\nThe issue at trial was whether the creation of a security interest by Forge in favor of ANZ bank affected the mutuality required for the right of set-off under the insolvency context.\n\n\nMaterial Facts\n\nAt the time of Forge’s liquidation in 2014, there were unresolved mutual claims stemming from contracts made in 2012.\nCrucially, Forge had granted a security interest in its claims to ANZ, registered in July 2013.\n\n\nLegal Issue\n\nThe key legal question was whether the attachment of a security interest under the PPSA precludes the possibility of a set-off because it disrupts the mutuality of interest.\n\n\nStatutes in Contention\n\nThe discussion centered on Section 19 of the PPSA, which deals with the attachment of security interests and its implications on the rights of creditors and debtors.\n\n\nPrecedents and Judicial Opinions\n\nThe case is significant as it discusses the attachment rule in the context of the PPSA and examines the abolition of the traditional concept of crystallisation of security interests upon insolvency.\n\n\nJudicial Interpretation\n\nAttachment Rule:\n\nJustice Tottle found that the attachment of a security interest under s 19 of the PPSA creates a proprietary interest in the collateral for the secured party immediately upon satisfaction of the conditions in s 19(2).\n\n\nEnd of Mutuality:\n\nSuch an attachment ends the mutuality of interest, thereby precluding set-off claims between the creditor (Hamersley) and the debtor (Forge) in insolvency scenarios.\n\n\n\n\nCrystallisation and Floating Charges:\n\nThe judgment also highlighted that the PPSA renders traditional concepts like crystallisation and the use of floating charges redundant in the regulation of security over personal property.\n\n\nKey Legal Reasoning\n\nThe court emphasized that the PPSA intends to simplify and modernize the law surrounding security interests, moving away from common law principles and focusing on statutory rules that provide clarity and predictability.\nThe proprietary interest is recognized for all legal purposes, thus ensuring that the secured party’s rights are protected universally, not just in specific contexts like insolvency.\n\n\nConclusion and Relevance to Modern Law\n\nThe decision underscores the comprehensive effect of the PPSA on traditional securities law, demonstrating its intent to provide a uniform framework that decreases reliance on varied interpretations of common law concepts.\nIt highlights the importance of understanding statutory provisions in managing commercial and legal risks in insolvency situations.\n\n\n\n\nVesting\n\nWhite v Spiers Earthworks Pty Ltd (2014) 99 ACSR 214; [2014] WASC 139\n\nJurisdiction\n\nCourt: Supreme Court of Western Australia\n\n\nParties\n\nPlaintiff: White (acting through receivers)\nDefendant: Spiers Earthworks Pty Ltd\n\n\nProcedural History\n\nThis case addresses the issue of vesting of unperfected security interests under the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 (Cth) (PPSA) during corporate administration.\n\n\nOriginal Dispute\n\nSpiers Earthworks entered into a hire purchase agreement involving various vehicles and equipment with a company.\nThe agreement was part of a broader sale of a business transaction.\n\n\nCurrent Trial Issue\n\nWhether the unperfected security interest of Spiers Earthworks in the hire assets vested in the company upon the appointment of administrators, as per PPSA s 267.\n\n\nMaterial Facts\n\nThe company entered into administration on July 24, 2013, with a bank holding a perfected security interest over the company’s assets.\nReceivers sought a declaration that Spiers Earthworks’ unperfected security interest in the hire assets had vested in the company under PPSA s 267.\n\n\nLegal Issues\n\nThe court needed to determine if the conditions for the application of PPSA s 267 were met, specifically if the security interest was unperfected at the time the administration commenced.\n\n\nRelevant Law/Statute\n\nPPSA s 267: Discusses the vesting of unperfected security interests in the grantor upon the occurrence of certain events, such as the appointment of an administrator.\n\n\nJudicial Interpretation\n\nLe Miere J analyzed whether the unperfected security interest of Spiers Earthworks in the hire assets should legally vest in the company.\nThe judge also considered the defendants’ argument that applying PPSA s 267 would constitute an unjust acquisition of property not on just terms, violating PPSA s 252B, which protects against such acquisitions under the Australian Constitution.\n\n\nKey Points and Legal Reasoning\n\nVesting of Security Interest:\n\nThe court confirmed that Spiers Earthworks’ security interest was unperfected at the time of the company’s administration and therefore vested in the company as per PPSA s 267(2).\n\n\nConstitutional Considerations:\n\nThe court addressed the constitutional argument by noting that the PPSA’s operation, in this case, was part of a regulatory scheme for adjusting rights among creditors, which does not constitute an acquisition of property under s 51(xxxi) of the Constitution.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion and Relevance to Modern Law\n\nThe decision reinforces the importance of perfecting security interests under the PPSA to avoid unintended vesting during insolvency events.\nIt also clarifies the constitutional operation of the PPSA, especially regarding the non-applicability of s 252B in contexts where the act is part of a regulatory scheme adjusting creditor rights.\nThis case is a critical reference for understanding the interplay between security interests and corporate insolvency under Australian law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 12: PPSA Part 3\n\nOverview: Enforcement of security interests under the PPSA\n\nChapter 4 of the PPSA\n\nSeizure of collateral\n\nDisposal of collateral\nRetention of collateral\n\n\nDistribution of proceeds\nRedeeming\nReinstatement\n\n\nGeneral enforcement provisions\n\nEnforcement provisions in the PPSA are in addition to other rights and remedies available to the parties – section 110\nRights and duties under enforcement provisions must exercised honestly and in commercially reasonable manner – section 111\nParties may contract out of most enforcement provisions where the collateral is not used predominantly for personal, domestic or household purposes – section 115\nExclusions from enforcement provisions set out in section 109\n\n\nSeizing collateral upon default – section 123\n\nSection 123(1):\n\nA secured party may seize collateral, by any method permitted by law, if the debtor is in default under the security agreement.\n\n\nSection 127:\n\nIf the collateral is seized by one secured party and another party has a higher priority security interest, the higher priority party may obtain possession of the seized collateral subject to notice requirements (section 127(2)).\n\n\nSection 125:\n\nSecured party who seizes collateral is under an obligation to dispose of or retain the collateral\n\n\nSection 140: Distribution of proceeds\n\nOrder of application set out in section 140(2)\n\n\n\n\nDisposing of collateral – section 128\n\nSection 128(2): A secured party may dispose of collateral by:\n\nPrivate or public sale\nLease (if the security agreement so provides)\nLicence (if the collateral is intellectual property)\n\n\nSection 130: Secured party must provide notice of proposed disposal to the grantor and any other secured party with a higher priority interest.\n\nNotice requirements set out in section 130(2)\n\n\nSection 131: Secured party has duty to exercise all reasonable care to:\n\nObtain at least market value (if the collateral has a market value at the time of disposal) or\nObtain the best price that is reasonably obtainable at the time of disposal\n\n\nSection 132: Secured party must provide a statement of account\nSection 133: Party takes collateral as result of disposal free of following interests in collateral\n\nInterest of grantor\nSecurity interest of secured party that disposed of collateral\nAll security interests in the collateral that have a lower priority than the security interest of that secured party.\n\n\n\n\nRetaining the collateral – section 134\n\nSection 134:\n\nA secured party may retain the collateral if the secured party gives notice and no notice of objection is given to the secured party.\n\n\nSection 135:\n\nSets out notice requirements\n\n\nSection 136:\n\nRetain collateral free of interests of the grantor; security interest of the secured party to whom title passes; and all security interests that have a lower priority than the security interest of that secured party.\n\n\nSections 137, 138:\n\nProvisions relating to objections\n\n\n\n\nRedeeming collateral – section 142\n\nSection 142: Prior to disposal of the collateral, any other person with an interest in the collateral or the grantor may redeem the collateral by paying:\n\nthe amount required to discharge the obligations, or by performing the obligations, secured by security interests in the collateral; and\nthe expenses incurred in relation to enforcement.\n\n\n\n\nReinstating the security agreement – section 143\n\nSection 143: Prior to disposal or retention of the collateral, a person may reinstate the security agreement by:\n\nPaying any amounts in arrears and expenses incurred in relation to enforcement; and\nRemedying any other default.\n\n\n\n\nRecap: Operation of the PPSA\n\n\n\nIs the arrangement excluded from the PPSA? (s 8)\n\n\n\n\nDoes it involve an ‘in substance’ security interest? (s 12(1))\n\n\n– If not, does it involve a deemed security interest? (s 12(3))\n– Is it a Purchase Money Security Interest (PMSI)? (s 14)\n\n\n\n\nIf so, has the secured party ‘perfected’ their security interest? (ss 19-22)\n\n\n– Attachment of the security interest (s 19)\n– Enforceability against third parties (s 20)\n– Perfection through possession, control or registration (s 21)\n\n\n\n\nIf so, are there any other competing security interests over the same collateral? (if no – go to step 5) If yes then:\n\n\n– Apply the priority rules in Pt 2.6 (start with the default rule s 55)\n– Check for special types (e.g. PMSI, control over accounts)\n\n\n\n\nApply the enforcement rules (Ch 4) - Are they excluded (e.g. receiverships)? (ss 109-115)\n\n\n\n\nCheck for taking free (extinguishment) rules (Pt 2.5)\r\nPerfecting security interest over bank accounts\r\nA valid security interest over an ADI account must be “perfected” to ensure that it enjoys the highest possible priority. Failure to perfect a security interest may result in it being defeated by a subsequently perfected security interest or rendered unenforceable in the grantor’s insolvency (see sections 55(3) and 267, PPSA).\r\nYou can perfect security over an ADI account in two ways:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegistration on the Personal Property Securities Register (PPSR)\nBy taking control over the ADI account (but this method is only available if you’re the account bank taking security over a customer’s account held at your bank)\r\nThese options are summarised in the table below.\n\nPerfection by control\r\nPerfection by registration\r\nWho can perfect?\r\nOnly an ADI that takes security over an account held with it can perfect by control (section 25, PPSA).\r\nAny person who takes security over an ADI account can perfect by registration on the PPSR.\r\nSteps required to perfect\r\nPerfection occurs automatically without the need to register a financing statement (section 21, PPSA).\r\nRequires a financing statement be lodged online with the PPSR.\r\nAdvantages\r\nSecurity interests perfected by control will defeat security interest perfected in any other way (section 57, PPSA).\r\nIf a secured party has control over an ADI account for the purposes of Part 9.5 of the PPSA it can make a registration on the PPSR disclosing that it has control. This avoids the ADI account being a “circulating asset” and the security interest being subject to certain statutorily preferred creditors.\r\nNote, the concept of “control” for the purposes of Part 9.5 is different from the concept of perfection by control. The former concept is the level of control the secured party needs to exercise over the ADI account to avoid it being a circulating asset. The latter concept refers to a method of perfecting a security interest over an ADI account (which is only available to an ADI taking security over an account held with it). See ADI account and circulating assets below for more information on this advantage.\r\nDisadvantages\r\nOnly available to the ADI that holds the account.\r\nA security interest over an ADI account (other than a term deposit) will be a “circulating security interest” subject to certain statutorily preferred claims. See ADI account and circulating assets below for more information on this disadvantage.\r\nSecurity interests perfected by registration alone will rank behind a security interest perfected by control (section 57, PPSA)."},"UTS-Law-Notes/IPLA-TUTORIAL-QUESTIONS":{"title":"IPLA TUTORIAL QUESTIONS","links":["tags/tag-notes","tags/tag-tutorial"],"tags":["tag-notes","tag-tutorial"],"content":"tag-notestag-tutorial\n \tUTS CRICOS PROVIDER CODE 00099F  \n\n70327\r\nIntroduction to Property and Commercial Law\nAUTUMN 2024 TUTORIAL GUIDE\r\n(Topics 1-3: Introduction to Property, Equitable Interest and Trust)\nTable of Contents\r\nTopic 1: Introduction to Commercial Law\t4\r\nTo do before your tutorial\t4\r\nConceptual questions\t4\r\nProblem questions\t6\r\nScenario 1\t6\r\nScenario 2\t7\r\nScenario 3\t7\r\nScenario 4\t7\r\nScenario 5\t7\r\nScenario 6\t8\r\nScenario 7\t8\r\nScenario 8\t8\r\nScenario 9\t9\r\nScenario 10\t9\r\nTopic 2: What is Property?\t11\r\nTo do before your tutorial\t11\r\nConceptual questions\t11\r\nProblem questions\t12\r\nProblem question 1\t12\r\nProblem question 2\t12\r\nScenario 1\t13\r\nScenario 2\t13\r\nScenario 3\t13\r\nTopic 3: Equitable Interests in Property and the Nature of a Trust\t15\r\nTo do before your tutorial\t15\r\nConceptual questions\t16\r\nProblem questions\t17\r\nProblem question 1\t17\r\nProblem question 2\t17\r\nProblem question 3\t17\r\nProblem question 4\t18\nTopic 1: Introduction to Commercial Law\nTo do before your tutorial\n\nRead: Goode, Roy ‘The Codification of Commercial Law’ (1988) 14 Monash University Law Review 135. www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MonashULawRw/1988/5.pdf\nWatch: Lecture Podcast: Introduction to Commercial Law\nPrepare: Go through and think about the conceptual and problem questions. Be prepared to work through these in class. Whether online or face to face, be prepared for your tutor to ask you to contribute.\nNote1: Check the Tutorial Leaders folder in Module 1 in Week 1 (Tutorial Guide Topic 1). From Week 2 (Tutorial Guide Topic 2), 4-5 students are nominated each week to be seminar leaders. This means that your tutor will first direct questions to the seminar leaders about the readings. Contributions are not formally assessed but may be taken into account in borderline final results. Problem questions are done as a group.\nThere will be no tutorial leaders in Week 1 (Tutorial Guide Topic 1) as we get to know our tutorial groups and about the subject.\r\nNote2: The first tutorial class will start on 19 Feb 2024 (Week 1) (covering the contents in Tutorial Guide Topic 1). \n\nConceptual questions\n\nConsider some of these questions from the Topic 1 Slides.  What are the issues and how do we go about finding the answer to these problems:\n\nWhat rights does Bob have if the fridge he bought from Harvey Norman does not work?\nWhat happens if the car Alan buys from Barbara was in fact stolen from a caryard?\nWho is liable if Anne is injured when a tv bought by Bob from JB HiFi explodes?\nWhat happens if Bank A lends Bob money to buy a car, and takes an interest in the car to secure the repayments, and Bob loses his job and cannot pay?\nWhat can Mr Adams do if the car he leaves with the repair shop for servicing is damaged?\nWho bears the loss if goods you have ordered are damaged in transit before you receive them?\nWhat happens if Mr Adams give Bank A an interest in his truck to borrow money, and then gives Bank B an interest in the same truck to borrow more money, and goes bankrupt?\nHow does a bank or lender protect itself by taking an interest in a company’s assets when it provides finance to the company?\n\n\nCommercial law is largely concerned with the rights and duties arising from the supply of goods and services in trade.   Discuss what you think might be some of the concerns and priorities of the following parties in commercial transactions:\n\nPurchaser\nSeller\nManufacturer/ supplier\nDelivery driver/ transporter\nWarehouse/ storage facility\nBank or lender lending money to a purchaser or business\nBorrower of money\n\n\nDescribe the history of commercial law and the sources of it now?\nWhat do you understand by “common law” and “equity” – what is the difference between them?\nWhat are some commercial law concepts we get from the common law?  How do you see statutes impacting on common law?\nWhat is the nature of a lease?  Discuss the differences between an operating lease and a finance lease?\nWhat is the essence of a bailment?\nWhat is the difference between a bailment and a consignment?\nWhat distinguishes a licence from a lease?\nWhat is the difference between a sale and a hire purchase?\nWhat is the role of finance and lending in commercial law and what is the function of providing security?\nWhat are some forms of property that could be used as security for a loan?\n\nProblem questions\r\n– in each of the following scenarios identify:\n\n(a) The type of transaction(s)\n(b) Name the party and their role (eg purchaser/ vendor/ consignor)\n(c) Describe the concerns and interests of the parties.\r\nNote:  these are issues we will return to later in the session. The purpose of the questions in Topic 1 is to think about the types of commercial dealings, the types of interests that different parties can have in property, and where tensions can arise between parties having an interest in the same property.  You do not need to apply any legislation to solve these problems – at this stage simply identify the issues.\n\nScenario 1\r\nAmanda is a recently admitted barrister.  She is intending to start practice at the bar in mid 2021.  She has applied to rent chambers from Ground Floor Wentworth Chambers.  She is starting from scratch and needs a number of things to commence: barristers’ robes, a wig, a new computer and printer.  She has heard of a company that supplies office equipment and you just pay a monthly fee for 12 months and they give you upgraded models every year.  The other alternative is to buy them from JB Hifi and borrow some money from the bank to buy it.  She buys the robes and send them to the drycleaners to be cleaned and have some alterations done before she uses them.  However on return, there are burn marks on the robes.\nScenario 2\r\nMr and Mrs Smith want to buy a car.  They approach their local car dealer who says they can buy the car with a loan from BMW Finance Pty Ltd.  BMWF gives them the $100K if they agree that the car is security for the loan.  The local car dealer obtains the cars to show in their showroom from BMW under an arrangement where BMW supplies the cars and the dealership pays BMW when the car is sold.\nScenario 3\r\nMr and Mrs Moss run a business selling tyres.  They have entered into a financing arrangement with a Bank and the bank secures any outstanding debts by taking an interest in all of Moss’s present and after-acquired property.  They are authorised to use stock in the ordinary course of business as long as they pay their debts.\nScenario 4\r\nMr and Mrs Moss allow a construction company working next door to their premises\r\nto use the back corner of their land for storage of building materials and valuable in exchange for a small fee.  Mr Moss urgently needs some money.  He takes two computers from the goods stored by the construction company and takes them to a pawnbroker and gives them to the broker to hold until he repays the $2000 he borrows from them.\nScenario 5\r\nIn 2015, Wal’s Garden Services purchased some gardening equipment with a loan from a third party lender. Wal then agrees to lease some of the equipment (5 rideon mowers) to his friend Andy for a year.  Andy took possession of the mowers and moved them to Queensland in his new business up there.\nIn March 2017, Andy borrowed money from Quick Money Queensland (QMQ). He gave QMQ a security interest over all of his assets including the mowers. In mid 2017 Andy went bankrupt.\nScenario 6\nRick is very pleased with the new BMW he has recently purchased (worth over $100,000, with a loan from BMW Finance Ltd secured against the vehicle.) Rick takes his new car around to his friend’s place for a party. During the course of the party the host (Elliott) realises they need more beer. Unfortunately Rick’s car is the last in the driveway and Rick is currently engrossed in a karaoke session with other party goers so Elliott asks Rick if he can take the car, which Rick agrees to. During the trip Elliott has a minor accident which dents the driver’s side door.  Rick puts it in for repair at “Beamers R’ Us” smash repairs. Rick is told by the repairer that a new part needs to be ordered and this will take 2 days, during which time the car must remain in the workshop.\nScenario 7\r\nSunshine Bank loaned money to HappyDays Hotel secured against the land on which the hotel was located.  HappyDays fell into arrears in repaying the loan and Sunshine exercised its rights, sold the property to a third party, Southern Hotels. Southern became the registered proprietor.  Subsequently, Southern needed to raise money.  It issued debentures to a superannuation trustee and gave an interest in the property.\nScenario 8\r\nJavier is a car salesman with Spectacular Motors. Javier has recently dealt with a customer Max Smith. Max has traded in his Lexus for a value of 80,000 and purchased a new Porsche from Spectacular Motors for 100,000 (with 80,000 coming from the trade in and the balance provided by finance from Spectacular Motors). In fact, the Lexus is collateral for finance obtained by Max from LeaseCo.  \r\nMax then gives the Porsche to Aaron (his son) as a gift, and Aaron has an outstanding bank loan covering all present and after acquired property with Eastbank Ltd When Aaron defaults on his bank loan Eastbank seizes the new car. Spectacular Motors sells Max&#039;s trade in vehicle to Vivian for 90,000, and provides Vivian with finance for the purchase.\nScenario 9\r\nJenny is the general manager of Aztec Mining Ltd which is a mining services company that operates in the Hunter Valley in NSW. Aztec’s assets include 20 large industrial vehicles that are worth 100,000 each. The vehicles are covered by a 5year finance lease with LeaseCo. LeaseCo&#039;s contract with Aztec provides that LeaseCo has a security interest over all present and after acquired property of Aztec in order to pay off its lease contracts over the vehicles.  \r\nAztec obtains mining drills from TCo Ltd which is a specialist drill company. The contract between Aztec and TCo includes a retention of title clause which provides that TCo retains title to the drills until payment is made in full. The supply agreement also provides that Aztec must set aside 10,000 into a separate bank account with Ebank (not Aztec’s normal bank) which can be used by TCo to pay its invoices of Aztec is more than 30 days late.\n\n(a) The type of transaction(s)\n\noperating Lease\nfloating charge\noperating Lease\nfixed charge of 10k in bank of vendors choice if they don’t pay\n\nsecurity\n\n\n\n\n(b) Name the party and their role (eg purchaser/ vendor/ consignor)\n\nAztec (Lessee) and Lease Co (Leasor)\nAztec (Purchaser) and TCo (Vendor)\n\n\n(c) Describe the concerns and interests of the parties.\n\n\nLease Co has an interest in current assets and any future assets\n\n\nTCo has an interest in just the drills, but may butt heads with Lease Co if Aztec defaults, however, Aztec does not have title\n\n\n\n\nScenario 10\r\nSunsafe Pty Ltd (Sunsafe) is a zinc mining company in South Australia. While zinc prices have been falling Sunsafe had calculated that increasing output would enable them to maintain profits. The strategy required acquiring further equipment. Sunsafe contacted businesses which had access to the sorts of equipment it needed.\r\nHard Rock Imports Pty Ltd (Hard Rock) usually only imported equipment to sell to mining equipment hire companies. But considering Sunsafe’s circumstances agreed to draw up a one-off lease agreement at 10,000 per month to hire a Caterpillar 797 dump truck. The lease was for two years with an option for a third. \r\nTonka Pty Ltd was a mining equipment hire and sale business which had a Komatsu 960 dump truck which was also leased to Sunsafe at 10,000 per month over an initial period of 2 years with an option to extend the lease after 2 years. There was also an option to purchase the equipment for a fixed amount at the end of the lease. In the agreement the lessee was prohibited from disposing of the Komatsu to a third party unless the option to buy had been exercised and title transferred. Tonka Pty Ltd also had an Hitachi EH5000 dump truck for hire. Sunsafe were not sure how long they would need to use the truck so they entered into a monthly rental agreement with Tonka Pty Ltd for $10,000 per month. The lease contract allowed the lessee to extend the lease at the end of each month which Sunsafe has done for 18 months.\n\n(a) The type of transaction(s)\n\nOperating Lease\nOperating Lease\nHire / purchase\n\n\n(b) Name the party and their role (eg purchaser/ vendor/ consignor)\n\nSunshine (Lessee) and Hard Rock Imports (Leasor)\nSunshine (Lessee) and Tonko (Leasor)\nSunshine (Hiree) and Tonko (Hirer)\n\n\n(c) Describe the concerns and interests of the parties.\n\nEach Leasor has interest in their own property\n\n\n\nTopic 2: What is Property?\nTo do before your tutorial\n\nRead: Text Chapter 1 and the cases Agripower Barraba Pty Ltd v Blomfield [2015] NSWCA 30 and Parker v British Airways Board [1982] 1 QB 1004.\nWatch: Lecture Podcast: Introduction to Property\nPrepare: Go through and think about the conceptual and problem questions. Be prepared to work through these in class.

Vendor has registered the business name Spectacular Motors and also has a registered trademark over that name. They set up a company called Moss Ltd to purchase Spectacular Motors. Vendor Pty Ltd (through its managing director-Zachary) has promised in the conversations during the sale process that the business will generate more than $2 million in profit a year.\r\nSpectacular Motors will be run as a family business. Mike is the Managing Director of Moss Ltd, Mary is the Company Secretary and Rachel and Reuben are directors. The purchase contract is signed by Mike (as director of Moss Ltd) and Mary (as company secretary of Moss Ltd). Zachary signs the contract ‘for and on behalf of Vendor Pty\r\nLtd’.\r\nThe Moss’ and Ross’ come to you for legal advice with the purchase of the business.\r\nSpecifically advise them in relation to the following questions:\n\nList the types of personal property they would expect to be included in the sale of the business.\r\nEXAM EXPECTATION: REAL PROPERTY AND PERSONAL PROPERTY TABLES\n\nCars - vehicles\nMerchandise\nInterior amenities and furniture\nParts\nVehicle Equipment\nOffice equipment\nRights to brand servicing\nEmployee contracts\nRights to trademark\nLogos\nRights to business name\nVehicle database\ndumpsters\nfinancial record access\ncontracts with third parties (suppliers, leasing, cleaners)\n\n\nList the types of real property they would expect to be included in the sale of the business.\n\nLand - whatever form it comes in\nrelevant storage/garage\nparking lot spaces\n\n\nExplain to them the difference between Property Rights and Personal Rights.\n\nPersonal Right\n\ndistinguished in the law from purely “personal rights”, or rights in personam which are rights available against a particular person or persons only and not in respect of a “thing”\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem question 2\r\nThe premises of Spectacular Motors are quite dated so the Moss’ and Ross’ are keen to renovate the dealership to make it more attractive to customers. The Moss’ engage the services of their nephew Pete from Compete Cleaners to do a thorough clean before the workmen commence renovations. Consider the following scenarios:\r\nScenario 1\r\nAt the end of a long day of cleaning Pete opens the oversized dumpster, which is located on the premises, to throw out the last rubbish bag when something shiny catches his eye. He reaches in and pulls out a dirty large diamond encrusted watch. Pete can’t believe his luck at such a find!\r\nPete initially thought it could belong to his careless cousin Rachel whom had just discarded it in the bin as she was always purchasing new flashy things, but he doesn’t call Rachel to verify this. Later that night Pete shares his good news with his neighbour and friend Louis Little. Pete explains to Louis how he found it amongst the garbage and that he had no idea who the true owner is. As Pete is very busy the next day with cleaning jobs, Louis offers to take the watch to get it valued.\r\nA few days later Pete pops by Louis’ house and asks Louis how the valuation went. Louis then refuses to hand it over saying as it was in his possession and Pete did not know who the true owner was he was entitled to keep it.\n\nBail relationship\nBritish airways - better rights\n\nNever made an effort to call rachel, however he was contracted to remove all property from that dumpster\nPete never made an effort to find owner\nItem was abandoned by true owner.\n\n\nPete was cleaning in his capacity as an employee, all work in Cth is done for the benefit of the employer\r\nScenario 2\r\nPete is scrubbing the inside wall of the showroom when one of the wall panels comes loose and falls on the ground. When Pete bends down to pick up the panel to replace it, he notices that there is a large hole inside the wall. Inside the wall is a large black garbage bag, which is filled with $100 notes.\r\nPete rings his uncle Mike Moss and tells him what he has found. Mike had no idea about the large sum of money and immediately calls the police. The Kogarah police come to Spectacular Motors and seize the bag of money “pending further investigation”.\r\nScenario 3\r\nPete is vacuum cleaning the fleet of Peugeots. As he is vacuum cleaning one of the cars, he finds a small diamond ring under the mat in the front seat. A label on the windshield of each Peugeot reads that they are proudly exclusively imported and commercially leased to dealers by “Prestige Motor Dealers Botany”. Pete finds a terms and conditions document in the glovebox which reads “The lessee is at all time responsible for all items of personal property. The lessor accepts no responsibility for loss or damage to personal property.”\r\nPete stops by Prestige Motor Dealers Botany on his way home and hands in the diamond ring to an employee. Pete leaves his phone number and address and says to the employee that if the owner is not found to call him and return it to him.\r\nPete comes to you for legal advice in relation to the following questions:\nWho has the better claim to the watch/ring in scenarios 1, 2, and 3?\nWould your advice be any different if Pete wasn’t working as a cleaner at Spectacular Motors but instead found the watch/ring when he was there as a customer of Spectacular Motors?\nWhat could the Moss’/Ross’ have done to assert property rights in the watch/ring?\nWhat rights does Pete have in relation to the watch/ring in the above scenarios?\nExplain to Pete the difference between:\n\nOwnership and possession; and possession and title\nActual possession and legal possession.\n\n\n\nTopic 3: Equitable Interests in Property and the Nature of a Trust\nTo do before your tutorial\n\nRead: e-reading Ch 3 of Parkinson and Wright (Eds)The Principles of Equity (2nd ed, Lawbook Co, 2003) and text book ch 1 [1.130]-[1.140], [1.240]-[1.300].\n\nListen to the narrated Topic 3 slides in the Subject Documents folder.\nThink about these issues and problem questions and bring your ideas and questions to seminars (online or face to face)\r\nCases:\nFarah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say-Dee Pty Ltd (2007) 230 CLR 89 (only paras 1-42, 100-119);\nCommissioner of Stamp Duties v Livingston [1965] AC 694;\nLatec Investments Ltd v Hotel Terrigal Pty Ltd (in Liq) (1965) 113 CLR 265\n\n\nWatch: Lecture Podcast: Equitable Interests in Property\nPrepare:\n\nGo through the Week 3 tutorial materials and think about the conceptual and problem questions.\nBe prepared to work through these in class. Whether online or face to face, be prepared for your tutor to ask you to contribute or answer questions.\nWeek 3 seminar leaders will be asked questions about the allocated readings, including the case of the week.\n(Check the Tutorial Leaders folder in Module 1 to know which week you are allocated to lead discussion in your tutorial.)\n\n\n\nConceptual questions\n\nHow do equitable rights in property and common law rights in property work together?\n\nEquitable rights in property complement common law rights by providing remedies and protections based on principles of fairness and justice, where common law may be inadequate or inflexible, ensuring a comprehensive legal framework for property interests.\n\n\n\nWhat are the characteristics of equitable property? How are they created?\n\nConsider and explain the meaning of these statements in DKLR Holdings Co (No 2) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) (1982) 149 CLR 431: Per Aickin J:\n\n‘If one person has both the legal estate and the entire beneficial interest in the land he holds an entire and unqualified legal interest and not two separate interests, one legal and the other equitable.’\n\nwhen a person holds both the legal ownership and the full beneficial interest in a property, they possess a single, complete legal interest, rather than two distinct interests (legal and equitable).\n\n\nPer Brennan J: ‘An equitable interest is not carved out of a legal estate but impressed upon it.’\n\nBrennan J’s statement emphasizes that an equitable interest does not reduce or split the legal estate; instead, it is a separate interest that is applied to or affects the legal estate.\n\n\n\n\nCan you think of a form or forms of equitable property for which there is no counterpart at law?  What forms of equitable property DO have a counterpart at law?\n\nEquitable Interests in Trusts\nBoth: Legal and Equitable Estates  such as mortgage\n\n\nWhat is the ratio of Livingstone’s case? [See Commissioner of Stamp Duties (Qld) v Livingstone [1965] AC 694.\n\nIt was held that that interest was not relevantly a beneficial interest, whilst transmissible by will, in property.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between proprietary and personal rights in equity, and what is a ‘mere’ equity?\n\nProprietary\n\nRights in property recognized by equity, such as the beneficial interest in a trust.\n\n\nMere Equity\n\nEquitable rights arising from fairness considerations, not attached to property, such as equitable estoppel.\n\n\nPersonal Rights\n\nA personal equity is simply the basic right of access to a court of equity of a plaintiff seeking equitable remedies that are not a proprietary remedy.\n\n\n\n\nGive some examples of a mere equity.  What was the mere equity in Latec’s case?\n\nequitable estoppel\nLatec argued for equitable relief to rectify or adjust the rights between the parties concerning financial transactions and property interests linked to the development and operation of the Hotel Terrigal\n\n\nWhat are the differences between legal choses in action and equitable choses in action?\n\nLegal choses in action are those which were historically enforceable in a court of common law, such as a debt\n\n\nEquitable choses in action are those which were historically only recognised by a court of equity\n\n\n\n\nThe interest of the holder of an equitable interest in property is commensurate with their ability to compel the owner to recognise their interest and hold it for their benefit: see, for example, Glenn v Federal Commissioner of Land Tax (1920) 27 CL\n\n\n\n\nHow are equitable interests regarded as property for some purposes and not others?\n\nEquitable interests are treated as property where fairness demands protection, such as in trusts, but may lack the same enforceability or recognition in contexts like third-party transactions due to their foundational basis in principles of equity rather than strict legal title.\n\n\nWhat is a trust?\n\nA trust can be defined as a relationship between a person known as the trustee, who undertakes to hold property, of which it is the legal owner, exclusively for the benefit of others, known as the beneficiaries.\n\n\nName two different types of equitable interest in trust assets.\n\nfixed trusts\nDiscretionary Trust\n\n\nWhat is the difference between a fixed trust and a discretionary trust?\n\nThe interest of a beneficiary under a fixed trust is determined by the trust instrument.\n\nThis is an equitable proprietary interest.\n\n\nUnder a discretionary trust, the trustee has a discretion to choose who of a class of beneficiaries to pay.\n\nNo beneficiary has any interest in trust assets unless or until they are selected.\n\n\n\n\nHow are trusts used commercially?\n\nSuperannuation:\n\nall superannuation funds are highly regulated forms of trusts.\nEmployees members have an interest in the trust property, rights which are defined by contract.\n\n\nManaged Investment Schemes:\n\nalmost all in the form of a public unit trust.\nFor example, real estate investment trusts (which if they meet relevant criteria are regulated under Part 5C of the Corporations Act.)\n\n\nTrading trusts\n\ngenerally taken to mean a trust (either a unit trust or discretionary trust) where the trustee is given power to carry on business activities with trust assets and functions as an alternative to a corporation.\nUsually the trustee is a corporate entity with nominal value.\r\nProblem questions\r\nProblem question 1\r\nMary Moss has recently discovered that she has been left something under the will of her great-aunt in Queensland who died earlier this year.  Her aunt Martha was very wealthy and owned a large portfolio of debentures, bonds and shares.  Martha was herself a beneficiary under the will of her ex-husband Rupert.  Rupert has left Martha a residuary interest in his estate which consists of several large cattle stations in Western Australia.  Neither estate has been administered yet.\nMary is also a partner in an accounting firm run as a partnership and the partners own a building and office equipment in their practice in Bondi.  Last year, the partners borrowed money from the NAB to fund their business during the pandemic, and gave all their assets as security for the loan.\nMary has come to you for legal advice in relation to the nature of her interests.  Her accountant has told her that there is some issue about being taxed if the interest is an interest in property.  She also wants to transfer all her property to her sister Jackie to hold for her and her children.  She owns a house in Bondi in her own name.\r\nSpecifically advise Mary in relation to the nature of the different interests and what can be transferred.\n\n\n\n\nMary has property right in unadministered land\nNAB has equitable mortgage\n\nNAB has proprietary rights in all other assets (partnership assets assumed)\nPartnership has legal ownership / proprietary interest\n\n\n\nProblem question 2\r\nJackie becomes the trustee of Mary’s property for Mary and her 3 children.  Jackie incurs costs in repairing the roof and other repair work on the house in Bondi.  Does Jackie have to use her own money to pay?  What sort of interest does Jackie have in the property?\n\nJackie has a proprietary interest in the property\nProprietary right to the property\n\nindemnified to the trust if she pays the difference\nFiduciary property - Farah\r\nProblem question 3\r\nTen years ago Spectacular Motors (SM) owned a different property to the premises it is now using and it has a long standing dispute in relation to what happened to it.  The property was Old System Title, not Torrens title land.\r\n10 years ago SM mortgaged the property to Fancy Finance Ltd for a business loan, but fell into arrears in repaying the loan and Fancy Finance, purporting to exercise its mortgagee’s power of sale, sold the property. It held an auction on a Monday with little time for proper advertisement (and the Mosses believe this was to make sure that the property could not be sold at the auction). The highest bid was well below what the property was worth and the next day Fancy Finance sold the property to its wholly owned subsidiary, Fiddly Finance for just over the price of the highest bidder, and it became the registered proprietor.\r\nThe Mosses were very upset about this but did nothing about it.  Five years ago, Fiddly Finance granted a floating charge over all its assets as security for a debenture issued to the trustee of a group of debenture holders, De Best Debentures Pty ltd. The prospectuses for the debentures offered explicitly stated that the land was owned by Fiddly.\r\nFive years later, now, the Mosses as directors of Spectacular Motors want to argued that Fancy Finance had fraudulently sold the property to Fiddly Finance, giving rise to an equitable right to rescind and set aside the sale of the property.\r\nQuestions:\n\n\nDescribe the nature of the different equitable interests in this scenario.\nWhich case is this analogous to?\nWhat happened in that case?\nWhat is your advice to the Mosses?\nWould the answer be different if the charge had not been created?\n\nProblem question 4\r\nWhen the Mosses formed their business, Spectacular Motors Pty Ltd, they had great hopes for the business.  They purchased a block of land for the sum of 800,000.  They took out a loan from the National Australia Bank (&#039;the Bank&quot;) and gave the Bank a properly executed mortgage over the property.  The Bank registered the mortgage straight away.   \r\nTwo years later, the property was not developed.  The Mosses needed more money to develop the block.  They approached the Newtown Building Society.  The Newtown Building Society was prepared to lend them 200,000 against the security of the land as the property was now worth 1M and would support both repayment of the first registered mortgage and their loan.  The Newtown B.S. drew up a properly drafted mortgage which the Mosses signed.  However the clerk at the Newtown B.S. forgot to register the mortgage or lodge a caveat over the property.  \r\nThe Mosses in fact spent most of that money on their family home, not the building site, and needed more money.  In 2008, they consulted a builder, Darren Doorstop, trading as Ready Mate Building Company, who was prepared to lend them the money and do the building work, but only if the Mosses gave him a mortgage over the property and a floating charge over the business.  Darren checked the register at the Land Titles Office and saw that there was a first registered mortgage only.  Relying upon that information, he agreed to loan Bob and Jackie 200,000 secured against the property.  Darren and the Mosses completed the paperwork.  However, the mortgage documents did not describe the amount secured by the property or the nature of the loan in any way, rendering the mortgage defective.\nIn 2010, Bob and Jackie had no money and no customers.  The business was going very badly and they could not pay their debts.\nAdvise Darren Doorstop.  Identify the different interests.\r\nThe 800k is properly mortgage - registered mortgage\r\n200k second loan - unregistered mortgage - no info\r\n200k loan - floating charge over business and mortgage over property made on faulty premises\n \tUTS CRICOS PROVIDER CODE 00099F  \n\n70327\r\nIntroduction to Property and Commercial Law\nAUTUMN 2024 TUTORIAL GUIDE\r\n(Topics 4-5: Bailment, Agency, and Statutory Interpretation)\nTable of Contents\r\nTopic 4: Bailment and Agency\t3\r\nTo do before your tutorial\t3\r\nPart A – Bailment: Conceptual questions  (Week 4)\t3\r\nPart A – Bailment: Problem questions\t4\r\nPt A - Problem question 1\t4\r\nPt A - Problem question 2\t5\r\nPt A - Problem question 3\t5\r\nPart B – Agency: Conceptual questions (Week 5)\t6\r\nPart B – Agency: Problem questions\t6\r\nPt B - Problem question 1\t6\r\nPt B - Problem question 2\t7\r\nTopic 5: Statutory Interpretation (Week 5)\t8\r\nTo do before your tutorial\t8\r\nTutorial Questions\t9\nTopic 4: Bailment and Agency\nTo do before your tutorial\n\nRead:\nText chapters 3 and 4 and the cases\nPangallo Estate Pty Ltd v Killara 10 Pty Ltd [2007] NSWSC 1528 (bailment where the form of the property changes ie grapes into wine); and\nProspect Industries v Anscor Pty Ltd [2003] QSC 296 (the difference between actual and ostensible authority).\nWatch: Topic 4 Lecture Podcast: Bailment and agency\nPrepare: Go through the Topic 4 tutorial materials below and think about the conceptual and problem questions.

Week 4 seminar leaders will be asked questions about the allocated readings, including the cases of the week.\n(Check the Tutorial Leaders folder in Module 1 to know which week you are allocated to lead discussion in your tutorial.)\r\nNote: TheWeek 4 tutorial will focus on the bailment topic, and the agency topic will\r\nbe covered in Week 5.\n\nPart A – Bailment: Conceptual questions  (Week 4)\n\nHow do you define bailment?\n\nThe voluntary assumption of possession is key; there must be knowledge of the goods and the bailee’s consent to hold them:\n\n\nExplain the difference between Bailment for Reward and Gratuitous Bailment\nBailment for reward\n\nBailee is paid for taking custody or control of goods.\nmechanic\n\n\nGratuitous bailment\n\nGratuitous bailments arise where the bailee is not paid for taking possession of the property and the bailment is terminated on demand.  Eg:\n\nDeposit\nloaning a car\n\n\n\n\nWho are the parties to a bailment?\nBailor: party who gives possession of goods to another\nBailee: takes possession but not ownership of goods\nSub-bailee: takes possession from bailee\nWhat was the issue in Pangallo Estate v Killara 10 [2007] NSWSC 1528? What was the basis of Killara’s claim to the property?\nDispute over whether grapes provided for winemaking constituted a bailment or a sale.\nSaid they were sold to her\nWhat are some of the rights of a bailee for reward?\nCustody for reward. eg: carparks – if car left in custody and control of the carpark owner.\nHire of work and/or labour: eg\n\nagistment of cattle on land if cattle left in the custody and control of the landowner: see\n\nBig Top Hereford Pty ltd v Gavin Thomas [2006] NSWSC 1159;\n\n\nCar left with a mechanic for repairs;\ndrycleaners;\nFurniture movers.\n\n\nPledge – eg pawnbroker: Palgo Holdings Pty Ltd v Gowans (2005) 215 ALR 253 [17].\nHire-purchase – delivery of goods from the owner to the hirer who holds them for use by the hirer\nWhen might a bailee be liable for damage to the property?\nNot interfere with bailee’s possession (depends on term of bailment.  Bailor may be liable for trespass, conversion and breach of contract\nInform bailee of dangers they are aware of.  Where the bailee accepts possession of the goods after being sufficiently warned of their dangerous qualities, the bailor will not be liable for subsequent loss or damage suffered by the bailee\n\n(See Pivovaroff v Chernabaeff (1978) 21 SASR 1)\n\n\nComply with terms of bailment (e.g. payment of agreed fee).  Bailee has lien over goods to secure payment\nExplain how liability rules may operate for a sub-bailment arrangement.\nOccurs where bailee transfers possession of goods to a third party for a particular purpose.\n\nBailee is a sub-bailor to third party as sub-bailee.\n\n\nSub-bailee must be aware they are bailee.\nMay be permitted or prohibited by head/original bailment\nSub-bailee owes same bailment duties to bailor as owed by the head bailee (subject to contract)\nRights may be varied by contract between head bailee and sub-bailee (but subject to express or implied consent by bailor to the making of the sub-bailment on those terms, and not otherwise).\nIssues often turn on whether bailor bound by exemption or exclusion clauses in contract between bailee and sub-bailee so that the sub-bailee can escape liability to both the bailee and the bailor.\n\nMorris v CW Martin [1966] 1 QB 716 –\n\nexclusion clause could not be relied on by cleaner as ‘customer’ was head bailee not fur owner (see next).\n\n\nThe Pioneer Container [1994] 2 AC 324 –\n\nshipping bailment (without limitation clause) allowed sub-bailment on any terms, subsequent sub-bailment contained exclusive jurisdiction clause which bound bailor.\n\n\n\n\nDistinguish a bailment from:\n\nBailment vs. Sale or Gift: intention to return it vs transfers ownership permanently vs transfers ownership without expectation of return or payment.\nBailment vs. Agency Relationship: physical possession of goods with an obligation to return them vs allows the agent to act on behalf of the principal, often without taking custody of the principal’s property.\nBailment vs. Trust Relationship: temporary transfer of possession without transferring ownership vs holding property on behalf of another for the benefit of a third party, with a fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of the beneficiary.\nBailment vs. Security Interest: temporary possession of goods without conferring a security interest vs a legal claim or lien on assets that are typically provided as collateral to secure a loan or obligation.\n\n\n\nPart A – Bailment: Problem questions\nPt A - Problem question 1\r\nRick is very pleased with the new BMW he has recently purchased (worth over $100,000). Rick takes his new car around to his friend’s place for a party. During the course of the party the host (Elliott) realises they need more beer. Unfortunately Rick’s car is the last in the driveway and Rick is currently engrossed in a karaoke session with other party goers so Elliott asks Rick if he can take the car, which Rick agrees to. During the trip Elliott has a minor accident which dents the driver’s side door.\nRick is furious with the damage to his new car and the next week he puts it in for repair at “Beamers R’ Us” smash repairs. Rick is told by the repairer that a new part needs to be ordered and this will take 2 days, during which time the car must remain in the workshop. Rick chose Beamers as they advertise themselves as the experts at expensive European cars. Unfortunately for Rick, the first night his car is in the repair shop a fire breaks out in the workshop after an apprentice panel beater spills flammable chemicals due to negligence. Rick’s car is destroyed by a fire that burns out the workshop, which did not have a fully functioning sprinkler system installed. Rick’s contract with the repairer has a clause which states:\r\n“While all due care is taken, Beamers R’ Us bears no responsibility for damage caused to the customer’s property due to negligence”\nAdvise Rick as to his rights against Elliott and Beamers R’ Us.\nWould d your answer be different if Rick’s car had been delivered to Beamers R’ Us by his local BMW dealer?\nPt A - Problem question 2\r\nReuben has used a new cleaning chemical which has unfortunately left white streaks on a brand new Mercedes GLA. Reuben calls Vinnie from Vintage Motor Repairs and explains the situation to him. Vinnie has a reputation as being the best in the field. Vinnie asks Reuben to drop the car at the repair shop in Botany and to leave it with him.\nLater that day, having inspected the car, Vinnie realises that he is out of stock of the special chemical R100, and the only place that will have the product in Australia is at a garage called ‘In Mint Condition’ (“IMC”) located in Ballarat, Victoria. With Reuben’s consent, Vinnie arranges with his distribution agent TOLL to pick up the car and deliver it to IMC’s garage before 6pm the following evening. The car was collected as arranged but a few days later the car has still not arrived at IMC’s garage and it has come to light that the car had been stolen during transit. It is unclear whether a TOLL employee has stolen the car or whether it was a third party thief. The contract between TOLL and Vinnie contains an exclusion clause that excludes liability ‘under any circumstances and for any reason.‘\nAdvise Reuben who would be liable in the circumstances.\nPt A - Problem question 3\r\nCars are everything to the Moss family.  In addition to their business, Mr and Mrs Moss have an interest in showing and restoring vintage cars.  In 2019, they purchased the chassis of 2 old Jag E type cars.  The cars were essentially a shell – they had no wheels or engine and needed to be rebuilt.  They are not mechanics themselves, so sent their cars to Jag Perfection Pty Ltd, an expert at rebuilding cars who would rework the parts sent to them into a fully functional car.  The arrangement between the parties was long standing.\r\nJag Perfection has gone into liquidation and the liquidator is claiming that Jag Perfection has title to all property in the workroom, including the E Types. The liquidator claims that Jag Perfection has property in the shells and the arrangement was for a sale of a new product – a rebuilt vehicle - to the Moss but that in the circumstances, the property was available for the company’s insolvency.\r\nAdvise the Moss’s.\r\npangello wine case - bailment not a sale of a new product, there is a contract to transform and inheritance from original item.\nPart B – Agency: Conceptual questions (Week 5)\r\nNote: The Week 5 tutorial will continue with the agency topic (Week 4) and then transition to Topic 5 statutory interpretation.\n\nHow do you define or explain the concept of “agency”?  Why is it a difficult concept to define?\nAgency in the legal sense is a relationship between two parties where one (the agent), with the authority of the other (principal), can bind that other in a legal relationship with a third party.\nCan take multitude of forms\nExplain the difference between actual authority and ostensible authority.\n\nWhat is the difference between implied authority and constructive authority? .\n\nImplied authority example: A manager hired to run a retail store has the implied authority to order inventory necessary for the store’s operation, even if not explicitly stated in their contract.\nConstructive authority example: If a company’s letterhead lists an employee as a “sales director,” the employee has constructive authority to negotiate sales on behalf of the company, leading third parties to reasonably believe they have such authority.\n\n\nWhat was the issue in Prospect Industries v Anscor [2003] QSC 296?  Do you think the outcome might have been different if it had been found that Mr Woodrow had introduced himself to Mr Hope as representing Count?\nwhether representations made by Mr. Woodrow, which led Prospect Industries to invest in the Wattle Scheme, bound Count through either actual or ostensible authority, given that Woodrow was alleged to have made these representations on behalf of Count. If it had been found that Mr. Woodrow had explicitly introduced himself as representing Count to Mr. Hope, the outcome might have been different, as this could have established a clearer basis for Count’s ostensible authority, leading to potential liability for the representations made.\nWhat is the role of consent in agency?  What occurred in Garnac Grain Co v HMF Faure &amp; Fairclough Ltd ?\nContract for delivery of 15,000 tons of lard from Allied to Garnac Grain.\nGarnac sold the goods to Faure.\nFaure had independently agreed to sell the goods back to Allied.\nAllied went into liquidation and the goods were never delivered leaving Garnac and Faure with heavy losses.\nGarnac sought to rescind alleging Faure contracted as undisclosed principal of Allied, and the fraud warranted rescission.\nHow can an unauthorised act be ratified by a principal?  What is the purpose of ratification?\nRatification occurs when an agent does an act without authority, but the subsequent conduct of the principal ratifies the unauthorized act as if it had been authorized at the time.\nThe act becomes valid and effective from the date of the act, not simply the date of the ratification.\nApplies where the agent exceeded their authority or where the agent at the time had no authority at all.\nConditions:\n\nAgent must have purported to act as agent for a principal:\n\nKeighley, Maxsted &amp; Co v Durant [1901] AC 240;\n\n\nAt the time of the act, there needs to have existed a principal;\nAt the time of ratification, the principal must be capable of doing the act himself.\n\n\nWhat are some of the duties and liabilities of an agent?\nAn agent is a fiduciary so owes to the principal the fiduciary duties:\n\nto act bona fides in the interests of the principal\nNot to place itself in a position of conflict between self-interest and duty\nNot to profit from the scope of the undertaking (save for agreed remuneration or commission)\n\n\nto follow the principal’s instructions\nto act in person (not delegate responsibility)\nto act in good faith\nto make a full disclosure of any personal interest\nto not make a secret profit\nto exercise reasonable care and skill\nWhat is the doctrine of undisclosed principal?  How does it render an agent liable to a third party?\nThe principles of undisclosed principals were summarized by Lord Lloyd of Berwick, delivering the judgment of the Privy Council in Siu v Eastern Insurance Co. Ltd. [1994] 2 A.C. 199 at 207 -\nAgent is not liable on contract when the principal is fully disclosed\n\nPartialy liable when partially disclosed\nliable when principle is disclosed\nliable when performing duties outside of agency scope regardless of disclosure status\n\n\n\nPart B – Agency: Problem questions\r\nPt B - Problem question 1\r\nSpectacular Motors Pty Ltd has expanded its business since it was bought by the Moss’s.  The Moss’s daughter, Rachel Moss, is particularly keen to start selling luxury cars.  Mr and Mrs Moss are not so keen as they see the local market in family vehicles.  Rachel’s role as a director in the company has been as the Accounts Manager.\nMike, Mary, Rachel and Reuben attend trade fairs regularly together.  At the Porsche stand at the 2020 show, Mike introduced Rachel to Mr Schmidt of Porsche, as a director of the company and they spoke generally of their business and interests in expanding their offering over time.  They spoke for about ten minutes and handed over their Spectacular Motors business cards.\r\nSubsequently Rachel visits Mr Schmidt and advises that Spectacular Motors would like to enter a consignment arrangement with Porsche for delivery of 10 vehicles.  They enter a contract.\r\nMike Moss finds a copy of the contract on Rachel’s desk.  He is horrified – he never discussed with Rachel the possibility of her entering contracts on behalf of Spectacular Motors like this.\r\nAdvise Mike.\nPt B - Problem question 2\r\nMeanwhile, Reuben had been in negotiation with one of his friends, Sandy Davidson, to purchase 10  vans for a company fleet.  His friend had started working for his father’s business Davidson  Electrics, 3 weeks ago.  He had a business card, describing him as Sandy Davidson, Assistant Purchasing Officer.\nSandy signed the contract placing the order.  Sandy’s father Eric found out and rang Mike to cancel saying Sandy should not have done this.  However, Reuben has already placed an order with Toyota for 10 vans that Mike Moss does not want if he cannot sell them.\nAdvise Mike\n\nIs Dawson Electrics bound by the contract?\n\nostensible authority, not liable though\n\n\nWould your answer be different if there was evidence that Reuben and Sandy had come up with the plan knowing that Sandy didn’t really have responsibility for purchasing cars?\n\nyes, knowledge would indicate that he is trying to take advantage\n\n\n\nPt A - Problem question 3\r\nCars are everything to the Moss family.  In addition to their business, Mr and Mrs Moss have an interest in showing and restoring vintage cars.  In 2019, they purchased the chassis of 2 old Jag E type cars.  The cars were essentially a shell – they had no wheels or engine and needed to be rebuilt.  They are not mechanics themselves, so sent their cars to Jag Perfection Pty Ltd, an expert at rebuilding cars who would rework the parts sent to them into a fully functional car.  The arrangement between the parties was long standing.\r\nJag Perfection has gone into liquidation and the liquidator is claiming that Jag Perfection has title to all property in the workroom, including the E Types. The liquidator claims that Jag Perfection has property in the shells and the arrangement was for a sale of a new product – a rebuilt vehicle - to the Moss but that in the circumstances, the property was available for the company’s insolvency.\r\nAdvise the Moss’s.\r\nPangallo Estate Pty Ltd &amp; ors v Killara 10 Pty Ltd  - bailment not a sale of a new product, there is a contract to transform and inheritance from original item.\nTopic 5: Statutory Interpretation (Week 5)\nNote: The Week 5 tutorial will continue with the agency topic (Week 4) and then transition to Topic 5 statutory interpretation.\r\nTo do before your tutorial\n\nRead:\r\nThe following cases:\n\nGamer’s Motor Centre (Newcastle) Pty Ltd v Natwest Wholesale Australia Pty Ltd (1987) 163 CLR 236; (on the meaning of “delivery” in s 28(2) of the Sale of Goods Act 1923 (NSW)) and\nVautin v BY Winddown Inc [2018] FCA 426 (Extraterritorial application of statutes and intention of parliament expressed in the provisions of the Australian Consumer Law), and\nSamwise Holdings Pty Ltd v Allied Distribution Finance Pty Ltd [2018] SASCC 95 (This case turns on the purported timing of possession of property in the context of a provision of the Personal Property Securities Act)\nLeeming, Mark “Theories and Principles Underlying the Development of the Common Law: The Statutory Elephant in the Room” (2013) 36 UNSWLJ 1002.\n\n\nWatch: Lecture Podcasts: 1 Statutory Interpretation principles and 2.

Week 5 seminar leaders will be asked questions about the allocated readings, including the cases of the week.\r\n(Check the Tutorial Leaders folder in Module 1 to know which week you are allocated to lead discussion in your tutorial.)\n\nTutorial Questions\n\n\nWhat is the modern approach to statutory interpretation?\r\n- Mischief Rule / Purpose rule\r\n- Literal Rule\r\n- Golden Rule\n\nWhat is the difference between a literal and purposive approach to statutory interpretation?\n\nLiteral means interpret based on dictionary meaning\nPurpose approach is taking the legislative intention, often at second reading speech or in full title name\n\n\nIn what sense do we mean that the court is trying to ascertain the “intention” of the Parliament?\n\ncourt takes second reading, parliamentary discussion, full title and act purpose sections of the act and compares those to the act itself and what it purports to address\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do the common law and statute interact?\r\n- Common law and statute interact as a dynamic and evolving legal framework, where statutes can modify or codify common law principles, and common law can interpret and fill gaps in statutory provisions\n\n\nWhat does the maxim “generalia specialibus non derogant” refer to?\r\n- Generalia specialibus non derogant -\r\n- specific provisions prevail over general ones.\r\n- The maxim refers to the rule of construction which presumes that a general enactment is not intended to interfere with a special provision unless it manifests that intention very clearly.\n\n\nWhat types of extrinsic materials may a court have regard to in interpreting a statute?\r\n-  parliamentary debates (Hansard),\r\n- explanatory memoranda,\r\n- reports of law reform commissions,\r\n- and international treaties\n\n\nWhat is the ejusdem generis principle?\r\n- Ejusdem generis - ‘of the same kind’, which usually applies to lists, particularly where a general item is included after specific items.\r\n- Determine whether the items are of the same genus.\r\n- It must be possible to see the initial words as intended to form, or capable of identification as, a genus.\r\n- Re Latham (dec’d) [1962] Ch 616:\n\n\nHow does the court consider the context and purpose of an act and why?\n\n\nHow does statute alter the common law?\r\n- A statute can alter the common law by explicitly modifying, abrogating, or supplementing existing legal principles to address contemporary issues or policy changes.\n\n\nDiscuss the interrelationship between the common law, equity and statute as explained by Leeming JA in Leeming, Mark “Theories and Principles Underlying the Development of the Common Law: The Statutory Elephant in the Room”.\r\n- Leeming JA explains that the interrelationship between common law, equity, and statute is symbiotic and integral, with statutes not merely supplementing but fundamentally shaping and being shaped by judicial decisions in common law and equity, thereby driving the evolution and coherence of the legal system.\n\n\nGamer’s Motor Centre (Newcastle) Pty Ltd v Natwest Wholesale Australia Pty Ltd [1987] HCA 30; (1987) 163 CLR 236\r\n- Parties: Gamer’s Motor Centre (Newcastle) Pty Ltd vs. Natwest Wholesale Australia Pty Ltd\r\n- Issue: Whether “delivery” under s. 28(2) of the Sale of Goods Act 1923 (NSW) includes constructive delivery.\r\n- Relevant Section of the Statute: Section 28(2) of the Sale of Goods Act 1923 (NSW).\r\n- Part of the Act: This section is located within the provisions governing the effects of the contract in terms of the transfer of property and possession of goods.\r\n- Relevant Definitions: “Delivery” might be defined within the Act to encompass various means of transferring goods from seller to buyer, including constructive delivery.\r\n- Court’s Finding: The Court found that “delivery” includes constructive delivery, allowing a third party to acquire good title under certain conditions.\r\n- Application of the Section: The Court applied this interpretation to find that Natwest could claim title to the vehicles despite the original seller’s rights, as the vehicles or documents of title were received in good faith without notice of any claim.\r\n- SAMWISE HOLDINGS PTY LTD v ALLIED DISTRIBUTION FINANCE PTY LTD &amp; ORS [2018] SASCFC 95\r\n- Parties: SAMWISE Holdings Pty Ltd vs. Allied Distribution Finance Pty Ltd &amp; Others\r\n- Issue: Priority of a perfected purchase money security interest (PMSI) over other registered security interests.\r\n- Relevant Section of the Statute: Personal Property Securities Act 2009 (Cth), specifically sections related to PMSIs.\r\n- Part of the Act: Located within the sections detailing the rules for secured transactions and priorities among security interests.\r\n- Relevant Definitions: “PMSI” and “possession” are defined within the Act to clarify the conditions under which a PMSI gains priority.\r\n- Court’s Finding: The Court found that the phrase “obtains possession” refers to possession ‘as grantor’ for the purposes of PMSI priority.\r\n- Application of the Section: The Court concluded that Allied Distribution’s PMSI had priority over other security interests as it was perfected by registration before the dealership, acting as grantor, obtained possession of the motorcycles.\r\n- Vautin v BY Winddown, Inc. (formerly Bertram Yachts) (No 4) [2018] FCA 426\r\n- Parties: Mr. Vautin vs. BY Winddown, Inc.

How is this different from a license, lease or hire purchase?\n\n(1) A contract of sale of goods is a contract whereby the seller transfers or agrees to transfer the property in goods to the buyer for a money consideration called the price.\nOwnership is actually transferred\n\n\n\nWhy is it important to know when title passes in a sale of goods?\n\ndetermines the precise moment the buyer gains legal ownership and the seller’s right to payment, affecting the rights and obligations of both parties, particularly in situations of loss, damage, or insolvency.\n\n\n\nWhat does the concept of “ascertained” and “unascertained” goods refer to?\n\n\nUnascertained Goods\n\n100 tons of wheat out of 1k tons\nGoodot identified or agreed upon at the time of making contract\n\n\n\nAscertained Goods\n\nOnce the 100 tons of wheat are selected and packaged, become ascertained\nIdentified after the time a contract is made (in accordance with agreement between the parties)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the basic rules for determining when property passes under a sale of goods?\n\n\nSection 21: Goods must be ascertained\n\n\nSection 22: Property passes when intended to pass\n\n\nS 23 Rules for ascertaining intention\n\n\nWhen can a buyer receive title even though the seller has no title?\n\n\nExceptions to the nemo dat rule\n\nS 26 Conduct by the owner\nS 28(1) Seller in possession\nS. 28(2) Buyer in Possession\nS 28(3) Mercantile agents\nS 27 Voidable Title\n\n\n\nProblem questions\nProblem questions - Who bears the loss in the following scenarios?\n\nB advertises that she has a second hand car for sale for $10,000.

A visits B and inspects the car.  A is unsure about whether he&#039;ll buy the car as he doesn&#039;t think that it&#039;s worth more than 85,000.  B offers to have the car valued by two valuers – one chosen by A the other by B – and then to sell the car at the price which is midway between the 2 valuations. A agrees to this.  B has the car valued over the next week by two valuers with the midway price set at $95,000. While driving the car home from the second valuation, the car is wrecked in an accident which is not the fault of B.\n\ns 24 rule 3\n\n\nB advertises that she has a second hand car for sale for $10,000, which she is expecting to receive under a will from a deceased relative.

B offers to sell the car to A for 10,000 and accept 1,000 payment immediate, then 1,000 each month until the car is paid off.  B says that she won&#039;t transfer registration, etc, in the car to A until the 10,000 is fully paid.  A agrees, pays 1,000 and takes the car. A pays 1,000 a month for the next eight months.

But she&#039;d like to drive something that makes more of a statement than a white van when she isn&#039;t working. But she doesn&#039;t want to sell the van because it is essential for her business. A financial adviser friend Simon has a solution. This is to transfer title to a finance company for a lump sum and enter into a lease agreement which will enable her to maintain possession of the van and enjoy a tax deduction on her monthly payments. She would then have enough money to buy a second hand Svalbard X1.  \r\nMary thinks this is a great idea and hands Simon the Transit Van registration papers so he can negotiate the deal but then forgets about it. Simon eventually arranges to have title in the van transferred to Shark Finance for 20,000 and a lease agreement is drafted.\nHowever a few days later Mary sells the Transit Van to Susie for $20,000 and Susie drives off with it.\nShark Finance discovers this transaction and claims that the Transit Van belongs to them whereas Susie asserts ownership. Who will prevail in these facts? Shark Finance or Susie?\r\nSusie - S 28(1)\r\nProblem question 2 - Nemo Dat\r\nSpectacular Motors has a stock of vehicles some of which are on a floor plan. That is, the possession of the vehicles is financed by a transfer of title to Shark Finance. Spectacular Motors is having liquidity problems and sells some of the vehicles through an agent to Hellonwheels in an after-hours transaction.

Be prepared to work through these in class. Whether online or face to face, be prepared for your tutor to ask you to contribute or answer questions. Week 7 seminar leaders will be asked questions about the allocated readings, including the cases of the week.\n\nConceptual questions\n\nWhat is the difference between a condition and a warranty?\n\nA condition is a fundamental term of a contract whose breach allows for termination of the contract and claims for damages, while a warranty is a lesser term, the breach of which allows for claims of damages but not termination of the contract.\n\n\nWhat is a sale of goods by description?  Does it make a difference if goods being sold are future or unascertained or specific goods?\n\nSection 18 of the Sale of Goods Act 1923 (NSW):\n\nWhere there is a contract for the sale of goods by description, there is an implied condition that the goods shall correspond with the description; and if the sale be by sample as well as by description, it is not sufficient that the bulk of the goods corresponds with the sample if the goods do not also correspond with the description.\nNot limited to retail sales – applies to private sale.\nFuture goods or unascertained goods being of a certain class are always sold by description - purchaser having not seen or inspected the relevant good(s) relies on the seller to provide a good that meets the description.\nSpecific goods may be characterised as being sold by description depending on the circumstances but applies where bought by the buyer at least in part in reliance upon the description given.\n\n\n\n\nHow does the implied term of fitness for purpose overlap with the implied term of merchantable quality under the Sale of Goods Act?\n\nThe implied term of fitness for purpose overlaps with the implied term of merchantable quality in that both ensure goods sold must meet certain standards, with fitness for purpose requiring goods to be fit for a specified use, and merchantable quality requiring goods to be of a standard that a reasonable person would consider acceptable.\n\nmake purpose known (fitness of purpose) - recommend\nreceive recommendation\nneeds to be in the seller’s line of trade - relying on the seller’s skill\nDoes the trade name exception apply?\nHas the condition been breached?\n\n\n\n\nIn relation to each of:\n\nAshington Piggeries v Christopher Hill Ltd [1972] AC 441\nHenry Kendall &amp; Sons v Willam Lillico and Sons (The Hardwicke Game Farm case) [1969] 2 AC 31\n\n\nIdentify in each case:\n\nthe parties\nThe issue\nThe relevant comparable section of the NSW statute\n\n\nFind any relevant definitions that apply in the Act itself\nHow did the Court apply the section or find the section satisfied on the facts?\n\nAshington Piggeries v Christopher Hill [1971] 1 All ER 847\nFacts:\n\nMink food prepared to specifications of plaintiff.\nMink feed contained dimethylnitrosamine in herring component which was highly toxic to mink.\nIt was toxic to all mammals but mink were particularly affected.\n\n\nHeld:\n\nNo breach of implied condition as to correspondence with description.\n“The test of description, at least where commodities are concerned, is intended to be a broader, more common sense, test of a mercantile character. The question whether that is what the buyer bargained for has to be answered according to such tests as men in the market would apply, leaving more delicate questions of condition, or quality, to be determined under other clauses of the contract or sections of the Act.” (Lord Diplock)\n‘In my opinion, it is working the word ‘description’ too hard to say that ‘herring meal’ was a misdescription.\nThe herring meal was contaminated but no poisonous substance was added to it so as to make the description ‘herring meal’ erroneous.’ (Lord Hodson) [p 853]\n\n\nHenry Kendall and Sons v William Lillico &amp; Sons Ltd [1969] 2 AC 31 (Hardwick Game)\n\nFacts:\n\nKendall and Holland imported groundnut from Brazil and sold it to Lillico and Grimsdale.\nLillico and Grimsdale sold it to the Suffolk Agricultural Poultry Producers Association with a written condition of sale including a clause that buyers take responsibility or latent defect.\nHardwicke Game bought the groundnut however it was found to contain a toxic fungus and its pheasants died.\n\n\nHeld:\n\nThe House of Lords held that Grimsdale was liable to SAPPA for breach of fitness of purpose and that the exclusion did not apply to the term, and that Kendal and Holland were in turn liable to Lillico and Grimsdale for breach of implied fitness for purpose.\n\n\n\n\nFit for Purpose: “particular purpose” - Hardwick Game\n\nParticular Purpose made known - resale for compounding for cattle and poultry rations.\n\nGrimsdale was liable to SAPPA for breach of fitness of purpose;\nKendal and Holland were in turn liable to Lillico and Grimsdale for breach of implied fitness for purpose\n\n\n\n\nFit for Purpose: Hardwick Game (text [8.400]\n\nHeld:\n\n“It was argued that, whenever any purpose is stated so as to bring this subsection into operation, the seller must supply goods reasonably fit to enable the buyer to carry out his purpose in any normal way.\nBut that can only be right if the purpose is stated with sufficient particularity to enable the seller to exercise his skill or judgment in making or selecting appropriate goods. …it could not be right that the buyer, merely by stating that he wants the goods for resale in the course of his business, could impose on the seller the obligation to supply goods reasonably fit for resale to every ordinary customer of the buyer no matter what his requirements might be.” (Lord Reid)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow and when can implied terms be excluded from a contract for sale?\n\nSection 57 of the Sale of Goods Act 1923\n\n‘Where any right, duty, or liability would arise under a contract of sale by implication of law, it may be negatived or varied by express agreement, or by the course of dealing between the parties, or by usage, if the usage be such as to bind both parties to the contract.’\n\n\n\n\nWhat principle of statutory interpretation applies to resolve the effect of s 57 and 64 when read together?\n\nThe principle of harmonious construction is applied to resolve the effect of sections 57 and 64 when read together, aiming to interpret the provisions in a way that makes them consistent and gives effect to both, thereby avoiding any conflict or rendering one provision redundant.\n\n\nWhat are the remedies of a buyer and seller under the Sale of Goods Act?\n\nS 51 Seller’s action for price\nS 52 Seller’s action for damages for non-acceptance\nS 53 Buyer’s action for damages for non-delivery – section\nS 54 Buyer’s remedy for breach of warranty\n\n\n\nProblem questions\nProblem question 1  [NEW]\r\nAutobianchi Pty Ltd, a sports car manufacturer in Sydney, approached Skoil Pty Ltd, also in Sydney, to discuss the supply of synthetic oil for use in its high performance engines. Synthetic oils are superior engine lubricants because they flow easily when the engine is cold and they don’t carbonise at extreme temperatures. Skoil has a reputation for supplying the best synthetic oils. Autobianchi did not advise Skoil of the exact specifications required for use in the engines and Skoil only intended to supply the oil it usually provides to all the vehicle manufacturers it deals with.\r\nSkoil provided a sample of the oil prior to the sales contract being executed. But Autobianchi didn’t test the oil.\r\nAutobianchi ordered 1500 litres of Skoil oil at a total price of $22,500 and started using it in their Duesenberg turbo sports coupe. Some customers started complaining of smoky exhausts and in extreme cases the engines would seize. Autobianchi traced the problem to the oil which was not suitable for the engine. Autobianchi now has a reputation for unreliable vehicles.\n\n\nDoes the Sale of Goods Act 1923 (NSW) apply?\n\n\nWhat are Autobianchi’s rights under the legislation?\r\n.\r\nWhat difference would it make if:\n\n\nAt the time of ordering Autobianchi spelt out the performance requirements of the oil to Skoil.\n\n\nSkoil had been made aware of the performance requirements of the oil, but had themselves in turn contracted with a third party to provide the oil which would comply with Autobianchi’s specifications and who were also engine lubrication specialists.\n\n\nThe contract referred to ‘high performance engine oil which would operate at extreme temperatures’; and contained the obligation that ‘the buyer relies on its own engine bench tests to verify suitability of oil’.\n\n\nProblem question 2  [NEW]\r\nFour Legs Good (FLG) imports and manufactures dining chairs and has its warehouse in Tweed Heads in NSW. Domestic Bliss is a furniture retailer situated on Victoria Rd in Five Dock. Domestic Bliss has had a successful few months and needs to restock with dining room chairs. Domestic Bliss lets FLG know that they only want to stock hardwood furniture and they want any furniture they buy to be made from oak.\r\nThe FLG representative meets with Domestic Bliss and brings some dining chairs that are within its range: the Windsor, the Shaker and the Ladderback. The Domestic Bliss buyer looks at the chairs and sits on them and declares that’s exactly what they want. Domestic Bliss would like stock of each model. They order 80 of the Windsor, 80 of the Shaker and 80 of the Ladderback. The total value of the order was 17,280 with each chair costing 72.00.\r\nDuring the meeting Domestic Bliss reiterated the requirement that the furniture be made with hardwood and the Four Legs Good representative assured Domestic Bliss that the chairs would be made of oak.\r\nNote however, each of the chairs shown to Domestic Bliss were in fact made with pine, which is a softwood rather than a hardwood.\r\nThe contract was signed at the meeting.\r\nClauses of the contract included:\r\nCl 22 The seller will provide dining chairs which correspond to the models and materials as inspected and identified by the buyer.\r\nCl 23 Unless already in stock the dining chairs will be manufactured or imported by the seller and will be delivered by 24 January 2019.\r\nCl 24 Payment is due once each part of the order is available for delivery.\r\nAs none of the models of chair were in stock FLG had to arrange for the Windsor, the Shaker and the Ladderback chairs had to be made.\r\nThe Windsors were available first and were made available for delivery on Monday January 21.  Both the Shakers and the Ladderbacks were available on January 23. However on the 24th of January there was fire at the Four Legs Good warehouse and all the Shakers and half the Ladderbacks were destroyed. The salvaged Ladderbacks (40) were finally able to be delivered on the 29 January.\r\nIn the meantime Domestic Bliss has discovered that both the Windsors and the Ladderback were made of pine rather than oak. However customers have been buying them without making any complaint.\n\nDoes the Sale of Goods Act 1923 (NSW) apply? Do not attempt Q1. An answer has already been provided below.\nDoes the delivery of pine rather than oak chairs breach the contract?\n\ndoesn’t breach the contract, s 57 express agreement, s 19 (2) - Provided that if the buyer has examined the goods there shall be no implied condition as regards defects which such examination ought to have revealed.\nmerchantable quality - customers seem to be buying it\n\n\nWho bears the loss of the destroyed chairs and why?\n\nseller’s liability, not the description and because the delivery clause has been breached - s 23 (2)\n\n\nIf there has been a breach of contract what remedy is available to Domestic Bliss?\n\nCl 24 seems like a condition\ns 53 (2)  The measure of damages is the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting in the ordinary course of events from the seller’s breach of contract.\n\n\nWhat difference would it make if the contract had a clause stating that the written document represented the entire agreement, and excluded any pre-contractual negotiations?\n\nThe entire agreement clause would nullify any exceptions, s 19(2) and representative complication is removed\n\n\n\nProblem question 1  [Optional]\r\nKim required lithium batteries for her laptop repair business. As well as repairing laptops she sells generic laptop batteries as spares. Her batteries sell for half the price of branded original equipment.\nKim orders her batteries from Sleeper Cells who manufacture batteries in Australia from battery cells imported from China. The specifications of the batteries are critical. The correct external dimensions of the battery are critical otherwise they won’t fit; and the power output needs to correlate with the power usage of the respective laptop.\nSleeper Cells won Kim’s business by emphasising their skill in manufacturing third party batteries which will work as well as the originals in a wide range of laptops. They also claimed they keep up to date with all the technology developments of the leading laptop brands.\r\nKim ordered four sets of batteries  to suit the W10, X12, Y15, Z20 model XYZ laptops. XYZ is a global laptop brand. Kim provided complete specifications for the batteries and was also assured by Sleeper Cells that their battery manufacturing experience meant they had a good idea of what was required for the respective XYZ models.\r\nSleeper Cells sent Kim preproduction examples of each of the four types of batteries for initial testing. They appeared to work. Kim ordered one thousand of each.\nAfter a month of selling the batteries to her customers, Kim started to get complaints from a number of different customers.\n\nMr White complained that the W10 battery worked well initially but after a few charges was not holding its charge as well as the original XYZ branded battery.\nThe X12 battery turned out to be a NiCad battery and not a lithium battery. Mr Green said that it worked according to its specifications except it sometimes exhibited a ‘memory effect’ which meant it would not charge completely unless put through a complete discharge/recharge cycle.\nThe Y15 battery worked perfectly. However Mr Redmond notified Kim that a subsequent XYZ firmware update meant that the corresponding laptops no longer recognised the Y15 battery. The aim of the firmware update was to restrict users to XYZ batteries only.\nMr Brown from the Department of Defence said that the Z20 model worked perfectly except occasionally overheated leading to laptops suddenly shutting down.\nKim has a clause in her sale contracts that says:\r\n“No liability for failure of goods to meet your purposes is accepted by us.”\r\nKim lost the battery maintenance contract for the Department of Defence.\nOnly half the batteries have been delivered and Kim now refuses to accept delivery of the balance of the order.\r\nKim can no longer sell the batteries and has useless stock.\nDoes Kim have a remedy against Sleeper Cells?  On what basis would each of Mr White, Mr Green, Mr Redmond and Mr Brown be able to bring a claim against Kim?\n\nProblem question 2  [Optional]\r\nSally is an 18-year-old student who visits Gigaflop Computing in Sydney and informs the salesperson she wants a laptop for gaming and doing university assignments.\r\nThe salesperson told her the computer had 16GB of RAM, a fast CPU and a separate graphics card so the laptop would be perfect for games as well as standard office applications.\r\nSally also informed the salesperson that the laptop needed to be reliable because she was a full fee paying student doing distance education and if her assignments were late and she failed a subject it would cost her a small fortune to repeat any subjects.\r\nThe salesperson assured her the brand of computer came top in the list of most reliable laptops in a range of surveys.\r\nSally told the salesperson that she would buy the computer because of its reputation for reliability, and because it would be suitable for both gaming and writing assignments. The laptop cost 600 which appeared to Sally to be quite a bargain. \r\nOn the way home the laptop was sitting on the front seat of Sally&#039;s car. She had to brake suddenly to avoid a cow and the laptop fell off the front seat. But the laptop was safely boxed and secured by form-fitted Styrofoam packaging.  \r\nWhen she first logged onto the laptop to set it up she discovered that the software diagnostics revealed that it only had 8GB of RAM rather than 16GB. \r\nShe took it back to the Gigaflop and there was an offer to look at it on the spot. After 10 minutes wait she was told the RAM was there but not seated properly so it didn&#039;t register, but it was able to be easily fixed. She was charged 50.00 for this service. It was explained the RAM must have come loose during transport. However RAM chips are held in place by clips which would not usually be dislodged by minor bumps. Next time Sally logged on the 16GB RAM was confirmed.\r\nWhen Sally tried playing games she discovered that the graphics card was not adequate to run the games she liked at Full High Definition (FHD) resolution. She had to play her games at 720p rather than 1080p resolution. Most modern PC games are designed to run on 1080p.\r\nAnd then after six weeks the laptop wouldn’t turn on at all. Sally took it to be checked and was told that the motherboard had short circuited and it needed to be replaced (after yet another 50 charge to have it assessed). She was told the short circuit was most likely due to moisture and probably caused by a spill. But Sally never eats or drinks near her computer equipment. The repair quote was 300.\r\nBecause Sally didn’t have the use of her laptop she wasn’t able to hand an assignment in on time and lost all her notes and she ended up failing a subject which cost her an extra 2,000 to repeat. \r\nClause 5 of the terms of the Gigaflop contract of sale states: &#039;Gigaflop Computers reserves the right to charge a service fee of 50.00 to inspect goods which may be subject to a warranty claim. Further, Gigaflop’s own assessment of any right to a claim is final.’\r\nSally now wants to return the laptop and get her money back.\n\n\nDoes the Sale of Goods Act 1923 (NSW) apply?\n\n\nWhat rights does Sally have under the Sale of Goods Act 1923 (NSW)?\n\n\nWhat remedies might be available to Sally?\n\n\nDoes Clause 5 of the contract make any difference to Sally’s rights?\n\n\nWhat difference would it make if all the facts are the same but it was revealed Sally made most of her income buying and reselling on eBay which is why she really required the laptop?\n  UTS CRICOS PROVIDER CODE 00099F  \n\n\n\n70327\r\nIntroduction to Property and Commercial Law\nAUTUMN 2024 TUTORIAL GUIDE\r\n(Topics 8-9: Australian Consumer Law)\nTable of Contents\r\nTopic 8: Australian Consumer Law (Part 1)\t3\r\nTo do before your tutorial\t3\r\nConceptual questions\t3\r\nProblem questions\t4\r\nProblem question 1\t4\r\nProblem question 2\t5\r\nScenario 1: Simon\t6\r\nScenario 2: Susie\t7\r\nSub-scenario (b)\t7\r\nProblem question 3 (Optional)\t8\r\nTopic 9: Australian Consumer Law (Part 2)\t10\r\nTo do before your tutorial\t10\r\nConceptual questions\t10\r\nProblem questions - General Protection under Chapter 2 of ACL\t11\r\nProblem question 1\t11\r\nProblem question 2\t12\r\nProblem question 3\t13\nTopic 8: Australian Consumer Law (Part 1)\nTo do before your tutorial\n\nRead: Text chapter 9 and the following cases:\nVautin v BY Winddown [2018] FCA 426;\nGraham Barclay Oysters v Ryan [2000] FCA 1099;\nRyan v Great Lakes Council [1999] FCA 177;\nCavalier Marketing v Rasell [1991] 2 Qd R 323\r\nYou must download or have access to the Australian Consumer Law and read the sections of the Act referred to in the lecture podcast, in particular : 2, 3, 51-59,  138-142, 147, 150, 236-238, 250-275.\nWatch: Lecture Podcast: Australian Consumer Law Part 1\nPrepare: Access the Week 8 tutorial materials in Canvas and think about the conceptual and problem questions. Be prepared to work through these in class. Whether online or face to face, be prepared for your tutor to ask you to contribute or answer questions. Week 8 seminar leaders will be asked questions about the allocated readings, including the cases of the week.\n\nConceptual questions\n\nHow do you establish that a transaction has involved a consumer under the ACL? Can a business be a consumer for this purpose?\nA person is a consumer of goods or services if, and only if:\n\nThe amount paid or payable for the goods or services is 40,000 100,000 or less or as prescribed by the regulations; or\nThe goods or services were of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic or household use or consumption; or\nThe goods are a commercial road vehicle or trailer\n\n\nBusiness can be a consumer (bunnings)\nWhen does the Consumer Law’s consumer guarantees apply to the supply of goods?\n(section 56)\n\nGuarantee relating to the supply of goods by description\n\n(1) If:\n\n(a) a person supplies, in trade or commerce, goods by description to a consumer; and\n(b) the supply does not occur by way of sale by auction; there is a guarantee that the goods correspond with the description.\n\n\n(2)\n\nA supply of goods is not prevented from being a supply by description only because, having been exposed for sale or hire, they are selected by the consumer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between the scope of s 19(1) of the Sale of Goods Act and s 55 of the ACL in relation to fitness for purpose?\nThe Sale of Goods Act does not deal with “services” at all.\nThe provisions in the ACL derive from s 74 of the TPA and amplify the general law under which a term might be implied that work and labour be done with due care and skill and materials so supplied will be fit for purpose\nNote that if not fit for common purpose then they will not be of acceptable quality – s 55 goes beyond acceptable quality and addresses particular purpose made known:\n\neg Baldry v Marshall [1925] 1 KB 260 – Bugatti case.\n\n\nHowever it will not apply where no reliance or reliance unreasonable (s 55(3)) eg where circumstances suggest seller has no particular expertise.\nOnus on supplier to prove that reliance unreasonable\nWhat is the difference between the scope of s 19(2) of the Sale of Goods Act and s 54 of the ACL in relation to merchantable/ acceptable quality?\n; while s 19(2) focuses primarily on goods being of “merchantable quality” based on their description and the buyer’s opportunity to examine them, s 54 considers a broader range of factors including the nature, price, and durability of goods, and excludes liability for defects made known to the buyer or arising from abnormal use.\nWhat actions does a consumer have against a manufacturer under the ACL that they do not have under the Sale of Goods Act?\nA consumer can recover damages from the manufacturer if goods manufactured do not comply with statutory guarantees as to:\n\nAcceptable quality under s 54:\n\n(except where arising from act or omission by another; cause independent of human control after goods leave manufacturer’s control; where supplier charges higher price than manufacturer recommends or average retail price) (s 271(2)).\n\n\nCorrespondence with description under s 56:\n\n(as long as description was applied by or on behalf of manufacturer or with consent, and non-compliance was not as a result of act or omission of another or a cause independent of human control after the goods leave the manufacturer)(s 271(3) and (4)).\n\n\nSpare parts and repair facilities and express warranties (s 271(5)) –\n\ndamages include reduction in value from the lower of the price paid or average retain price and any other reasonably foreseeable loss or damage – s 272\n\n\n\n\nWhat remedies were available in Vautin v BY Windown (No 4) [2018] FCA 426 against the supplier and the manufacturer?\ndamages for the breach of statutory guarantees of acceptable quality and fitness for purpose under the Australian Consumer Law, specifically sections 54 and 55, to compensate for the defective construction and unseaworthiness of the vessel.\nWhat are the similarities and differences between the protections under the Sale of Goods Act and the ACL?\nThe Sale of Goods Act focuses on implied conditions and warranties in the sale of goods, primarily concerning merchantability and fitness for purpose, while the ACL provides broader consumer protections including statutory guarantees on quality, safety, and fitness for purpose, along with direct actions against manufacturers, creating a more comprehensive regime for consumer rights.\nIf there is a breach of the statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law, what remedies does a consumer have available to them?\nRemedies and Enforcement Part 5-4\n\nIf a major failure:\n\nconsumer may reject the goods or recover compensation for the reduction in value of goods:\n\ns 259(3).\n\n\nIf services, consumer may terminate contract for supply or recover compensation for reduction in value of services.\nA consumer may also recover damages if it was reasonably foreseeable that the consumer would suffer loss or damage because of the failure to comply:\n\ns 259(4).\n\n\n\n\nIf not a major failure:\n\nIf it can be remedied, the consumer may required the supplier to remedy within a reasonable time (ss 259(2)(a), 267(2).\nIf the supplier refuses, the consumer may reject goods and obtain a refund or have the failure remedied and recover reasonable costs from the supplier:\n\ns 259(2((b), s 267(2)(b).\n\n\nThere is also the possibility of damages for the loss or failure if it was foreseeable.\n\n\nRejection of goods\n\nS 262 – some limits to entitlement to reject goods.\nA consumer cannot reject goods if:\n\nConsumer fails to exercise right within a reasonable time (s262(2))\nGoods have been lost, destroyed or disposed of; or\ngoods were damaged after delivery; or\nGoods have become attached to or incorporated into other property\n\n\nIf a consumer chooses to reject goods the consumer must return unless significant cost in which case supplier must collect at its own expense.\nSupplier required to give consumer a refund or replace the goods (and guarantees apply to replacement goods.)\nthe possibility of damages for the loss or failure if it was foreseeable.\n\n\n\n\nCompare the Sale of Goods Act and the ACL with respect to the provision of services.\nThe Sale of Goods Act specifically governs the sale of goods and does not address the provision of services, whereas the Australian Consumer Law (ACL) provides comprehensive protections for both goods and services, including guarantees on the quality, safety, and fitness for purpose of services.\nHow do the exclusion of liability provisions compare in the Sale of Goods Act compared with the ACL?  What is the effect of s 139A of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010?\nThe Sale of Goods Act allows parties to contractually exclude or limit liability for breaches of implied terms to a greater extent than the Australian Consumer Law (ACL), which imposes stricter limitations on the exclusion of consumer guarantees. Section 139A of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 reinforces this by rendering any contract term that purports to exclude, restrict, or modify the application of the ACL’s consumer guarantees void, thereby prioritizing consumer protection and limiting the scope for businesses to exclude liability for breaches of these guarantees.\n\n\nProblem questions\nProblem question 1\n\nAre any of the following parties a “consumer” for the purposes of the ACL:\n\nThe University buys a spectrometer for use in its chemistry lab for 20,000; ii) A hospital buys an MRI machine for 1m.\r\niii) The University buys a 100,000 Rolls Royce as part of its vehicle fleet iv) A car dealer buys a 10,000 hatchback to sell as retail.\n\n\nCan Mary Moss bring an action against David Jones in the following circumstances:\n\nMary Moss bought a coat from David Jones.  After she had worn it for some time, she contracted dermatitis.\nMary Moss bought a coat on sale from David Jones.  She operates a stall at Balmain Markets, selling coats.  Her plan was to wear it and then resell it.  After she had worn it for some time, she contracted dermatitis.\nMary Moss bought a coat on sale from David Jones.  She wanted a coat to match her green crocodile skin shoes.  She told the salesperson what she wanted it for.  The coat purchased was a faux leather jacket that looked identical to crocodile skin with a blue-green tinge to it.  When she wore it in the light, the coat looked blue.  It fit perfectly and was beautifully made.  David Jones have a no-return policy on sale items.\n\n\nBegone Burglars Pty ltd installed an alarm system into Spectacular Motors premises.  Mike Moss spoke with their managing director who assured him that if the wired were cut, the backup battery would take over.  Thieves broke in and cut through the wires and the alarm did not work.  On what basis might there be a claim against Begone Burglars?\n\nProblem question 2\r\nScenario Problem for Advice\r\nSpectacular Motors has a range of 2016 Svalbard X1s in stock. Initially, they were sold at the recommended retail price of 49,500.00. Lately the Svalbard X1s have been receiving bad publicity regarding sudden engine and clutch failure resulting in breakdowns on the roads and the market for X1s has declined sharply. \r\nMary sees an ad on television that states that Svalbard is the official sponsor of the Sydney Cignets (the local football team). Mary decides to boost sales of the Svalbard X1s by doing a promotion and selling them at the reduced price of 40,000.00. Mary plans on advertising on the front page of the Spectacular Motors website and on a billboard outside the front of Spectacular Motors.\r\nRachel Ross is head of IT at Spectacular Motors and designs the web page. Rachel hasn’t test driven the Svalbard X1 at Spectacular Motors. Mary tells Rachel to photo shop a picture of the Sydney Cignets team next to a fleet of Svalbard X1s. Mary has not received authority to use the Sydney Cignets picture but she figures that as Svalbard is their official sponsor, it won’t be an issue. The website and the large billboard is launched on the Spectacular Motors website and on site, which reads:\nBuy a Svalbard X1 from Spectacular Motors ON SALE NOW $39,999.00*  Svalbard is the car of choice of the Sydney CignetsTest Driven and approved by all Spectacular Motors directors We guarantee our Svalbard X1’s will never let you down\nFor every purchased Svalbard, Spectacular Motors will do a same day oil change and safety check of your car for free, valid for a year.\n\nNo refunds whatsoever or exchanges on sale items\r\nScenario 1: Simon\r\nSimon is an avid Sydney Cignets fan and he sees the advertisement  online advertising his beloved team and a flash new Svalbard. He purchases a white X1 from Spectacular Motors a few days before the Football Grand Final between the Cignets and the Kew Cats. On the day of the Grand Final whilst Simon is driving, the X1 suddenly breaks down on the Eastern Distributor causing major traffic delays. As a result Simon misses the Grand Final which he had premium box tickets to attend. The car is towed to the nearest Svalbard dealer at Rushcutters Bay and upon inspection the car has a faulty Electronic Control Unit which controls how much fuel gets to the engine. Simon is furious and demands a refund from Spectacular Motors.\n\nScenario 2: Susie\nSusie is on her way to work in Marrickville one day when her car starts making strange spluttering noises. It has been playing up lately and showing its age. Her boyfriend has a bakery across from Spectacular Motors and told her about the sign he saw about the great price of the Svalbard X1. Susie hasn’t seen the advertisement  but she trusts her boyfriend, so she calls them and asks to purchase a car that is 100% reliable for work as she drives a fair distance every day and she has had problems with lemon cars in the past]. Mike takes the call and says, “The Svalbard won’t let you down.” Susie says, “Sounds fantastic, I’ll take it.”\nSub-scenario (a)\r\nA week after purchasing her Svalbard X1 it develops a slight rattling noise that does not interfere with its normal operation. Susie returns the car to Spectacular Motors who inspects it, determines the cause of the noise and offers to repair it in two days. Based on her previous experience with defective cars, Susie refuses this offer and demands a refund, claiming a major failure to comply with the guarantee of acceptable quality.\r\nSub-scenario (b)\r\n6 months after purchasing her Svalbard X1 which has been running perfectly, Susie brings her X1 to Spectacular Motors for the free basic service. When she goes to pick it up later that day, she gets behind the wheel and when she turns on the ignition the car won’t start and despite all efforts by Spectacular Motors the major engine fault cannot be identified.\r\nAfter reading each scenario:\n\nDiscuss the potential liability of Mary, Mike and Rachel under the consumer protection provisions of the Australian Consumer Law and any other applicable statute, and\nidentify the potential claimants.\r\nPlease answer this question by referring to relevant provisions in relation to statutory guarantees under the ACL.\n\nProblem question 3 (Optional)\r\nRhine Oh Cruises\r\nBetty and Jim had just retired and as they had already paid off their house decided to spend some of their super lump sum on European river cruise. In all their lives they had never had a big overseas holiday. They wanted five-star luxury all the way. They decided on a twenty-one-day cruise from Budapest to Amsterdam with RhineOh Cruises described as a ‘trip of a lifetime’. The total cost of the cruise for the couple was $42,000.\r\nIncluded in the cruise was three gourmet meals per day, all beverages including the best wine, beer and champagne, and all onshore excursions including transport and any admission fees. They would be accommodated in the boat’s Riverview Suite for the duration of the cruise, and be able to see highlights of four countries without having to constantly pack and change accommodation.\r\nThis particularly suited Jim who had a chronic illness and was less mobile than his partner. The package also included five-star hotel accommodation at the beginning and end of the cruise as well as return business class flights from Sydney.\r\nHowever, in the month before the trip was to begin there was two weeks of record breaking torrential rain which flooded the Danube and the Rhine rivers making them unnavigable for the cruise boats used by Rhine-Oh because the height of the water prevented boats getting under bridges and docking at wharves. This was to be the case for a period of six weeks and understood by the cruise operators.\r\nNevertheless, passengers were not warned that they would not be able to enjoy cruising for the entirety of the trip. So, even though the cruise company knew weeks before embarkation that the way the holiday would be run would be completely different, the passengers were not given an opportunity to rebook at another date. When Betty and Jim arrived in Budapest they discovered that the tour instead would comprise coach trips throughout the itinerary. And although accommodation would still be five star, and all food was provided, most of their time was spent on the road and packing and unpacking at each stop. They did not see the same sights as listed on the Rhine-Oh tours brochure but instead were taken to sights which Rhine-Oh assured them were of equivalent interest and grandeur. Instead of an enjoyable and relaxing river cruise Betty and Jim endured a fraught and frantic road trip.\nThe Rhine-Oh Tours cruise was advertised in Australia, sold through an Australian travel agent, payment was made in Australian dollars and the contract was executed in Sydney.\r\nThe contract contained the following conditions:\r\nThe proper law of this contract will be the law of Hungary. Any dispute between the parties will be resolved by arbitration.\r\nCruise itineraries may be varied due to circumstances beyond Rhine-Oh’s control such as weather and river levels.\r\nIn these circumstances Rhine-Oh Tours reserves the right to substitute transport modes and accommodation of a similar standard where these variations are deemed necessary.\r\nRhine-Oh Tours has no liability to passengers for variations made to the itinerary under circumstances beyond their control.\r\nAdvise Betty and Jim.\nTopic 9: Australian Consumer Law (Part 2)\nTo do before your tutorial\n\nRead: Text chapter 11, 12, 13 and the cases\nAustralian Securities and Investments Commission v Kobelt [2019] HCA 18; see also\nACCC v Quantum Housing Group Pty Ltd [2021] FCAFC 40 and\nACCC v CLA Trading Pty Ltd [2016] FCA 377;\nACCC v CG Berbatis Holdings Pty Ltd (2003) 214 CLR 51.\r\nYou must download or have access to the Australian Consumer Law and read the sections of the Act referred to in the lecture podcast.\nWatch: Lecture Podcast: The Australian Consumer Law - Part 2\nPrepare: Go through and think about the conceptual and problem questions. Be prepared to work through these in class. Whether online or face to face, be prepared for your tutor to ask you to contribute or answer questions. Week 9 tutorial leaders will be asked questions about the allocated readings, including the cases of the week.\n\nConceptual questions\n\nHow do you establish that a transaction has involved a consumer under the ACL? Can a business be a consumer for this purpose?\n\ns 23 A consumer contract is a contract for:\n\n(a) a supply of goods or services; or\n(b) a sale or grant of an interest in land; to an individual whose acquisition of the goods, services or interest is wholly or predominantly for personal, domestic or household use or consumption.\n\n\nThree key elements:\n\n(1) consumer or small business contract;\n(2) standard form contract;\n(3) unfair term.\n\n\n\n\nCan both the Sale of Goods Act and the Australian Consumer Law apply to a single transaction?  When will a transaction attract the operation of one act, but not the other?\n\nYes, Sale of Goods is implied while ACL is statutory\nA transaction will attract the operation of the Australian Consumer Law but not the Sale of Goods Act when it involves consumer goods or services under $100,000 typically acquired for personal use, and conversely, the Sale of Goods Act applies exclusively in purely commercial transactions where goods purchased exceed this threshold and are not for personal use.\n\n\nHow can you establish that one or more terms of a contract are unfair for the purposes of the unfair contract terms regime in the Australian Consumer Law?\n\nPENALTIES\nSection 24(2) In determining whether a term of a contract is unfair under subsection (1), a court may take into account such matters as it thinks relevant, but it must take into account the following:\n\n(a) the extent to which the term is transparent;\n(b) the contract as a whole.\n\n\nSection 24(3) A term is transparent if the term is:\n\n(a) expressed in reasonably plain language; and\n(b) legible; and\n(c) presented clearly; and\n(d) readily available to any party affected by the term\n\n\nSEE NEXT QUESTION\n\n\nWhat is an ‘unfair contract’ under the Australian Consumer Law?\n\nA contract which may cause a significant imbalance in the parties’ rights and obligations, are not reasonably necessary to protect legitimate interests, and would cause detriment if applied or relied upon.\n\n\nWhat are some examples of unfair terms in a contract?\n\nSome examples are:\n\nTerms that allow a business to make unilateral changes to important aspects of the contract such as terminating or renewing it, increasing the charges or varying the type of product to be supplied\nTerms that have penalise one party for a breach or termination of the contract\nTerms that limit or restrict liability of one party or limits the right of another party to sue\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a standard form contract?\n\nprepared by one party to the contract that is not subject to negotiation between the parties – that is, offered on a ‘take it or leave it’ basis.\nsection 27(2)\n\nWhether one of the parties has all or most of the bargaining power\nWhether the contract was prepared by one party\nWhether another party was required to accept or reject the terms of the contract in the form they were presented\nWhether another party was given an opportunity to negotiate the terms\nWhether the terms take into account special characteristics of another party or a specific transaction\nAny other matters prescribed by regulation\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a consumer contract for the purposes of the unfair contract provisions of the Australian Consumer law? Is the meaning of consumer any different in these provisions compared to the definition of consumer used elsewhere in the Australian Consumer Law?\n\nA consumer contract under the unfair contract provisions of the Australian Consumer Law refers to any contract for goods, services, or land when acquired predominantly for personal, domestic, or household use, aligning closely with the broader ACL definition of a consumer but focusing specifically on the purpose of the contract.\ns 23\n\n\nWhat is a business contract for the purposes of the unfair contract provisions?\n\ns 23 (4) A contract is a small business contract if:\n\nBEFORE 9 NOV 2023\n\n(a) the contract is for a supply of goods or services, or a sale or grant of an interest in land; and\n(b) at the time the contract is entered into, at least one party to the contract is a business that employs fewer than 20 persons; and\n(c) either of the following applies:\n\n(i) the upfront price payable under the contract does not exceed $300,000;\n(ii) the contract has a duration of more than 12 months and the upfront price payable under the contract does not exceed $1,000,000.\n\n\n(5) In counting the persons employed by a business for the purposes of paragraph (4)(b), a casual employee is not to be counted unless he or she is employed by the business on a regular and systematic basis.\n\n\nAFTER 9 NOV 2023\n\n(a) the contract is for a supply of goods or services, or a sale or grant of an interest in land; and\n(b) at least one party to the contract satisfies either or both of the following conditions:\n\n(i) the party makes the contract in the course of carrying on a business and at a time when the party employs fewer than 100 persons;\n(ii) the party’s turnover, worked out under subsection (6) for the party’s last income year (within the meaning of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997) that ended at or before the time when the contract is made, is less than $10,000,000.\n\n\n(5) In counting for the purposes of subparagraph (4)(b)(i) the number of persons that a person employs:\n\n(a) a casual employee is not to be counted unless employed on a regular and systematic basis; and\n(b) a part‑time employee (including a part‑time casual employee counted under paragraph (a) of this subsection) is to be counted as an appropriate fraction of a full‑time equivalent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 20 of the Australian Consumer Law defines unconscionable conduct in terms of the “unwritten law from time to time”. What does this mean?\n\nSection 20 appears to refer to the equitable doctrine of unconscionable dealing as it has been interpreted in case law:\n\nsee for example Commercial Bank of Australia v Amadio (1983) 151 CLR 447.\n\n\nHowever, the words are general and the courts have not yet settled on what constitutes unconscionable conduct under the ‘unwritten law.’\nIndicating that its interpretation can change over time based on judicial decisions.\n\n\nThe cases which have granted relief in the basis of unconscionable conduct have often referred to a plaintiff as being under a “special disability”. What does this mean? Give some examples.\n\nIt is a disabling condition which is “one which seriously affects the ability of the innocent party to make a judgment as to his own best interests when the other party knows or ought to know of the existence of that condition or circumstance and its effect on the innocent party.”\nage, illiteracy, lack of education or a combination of factors\n\n\nWhat was the question left unresolved in Kobelt?  What clarification has Quantum Housing brought to that question?\n\nIn Kobelt, the question left unresolved was how far the notion of ‘systemic advantage-taking’ needs to go in order to constitute unconscionable conduct under Section 12CB of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001, especially in dealings with Indigenous customers.\nQuantum Housing clarified that it is not necessary to establish that the business engaging in the conduct has exploited some disadvantage or vulnerability\r\nProblem questions - General Protection under Chapter 2 of ACL\n\n\n\nProblem question 1\r\nNote: We looked at this question last week, but this week when answering this question, please focus on three general prohibitions under the ACL, which have been introduced in today’s lecture (such as s18, s20 and/or s24).\nSpectacular Motors has a range of 2016 Svalbard X1s in stock. Initially, they were sold at the recommended retail price of 49,500.00. Lately the Svalbard X1&#039;s have been receiving bad publicity regarding sudden engine and clutch failure resulting in breakdowns on the roads and the market for X1&#039;s has declined sharply.   \r\nMary sees an ad on television that states that Svalbard is the official sponsor of the Sydney Cignets (the local football team). Mary decides to boost sales of the Svalbard X1s by doing a promotion and selling them at the reduced price of 40,000.00. Mary plans on advertising on the front page of the Spectacular Motors website and on a billboard outside the front of Spectacular Motors.\nRachel Ross is head of IT at Spectacular Motors and designs the web page. Rachel hasn’t test driven the Svalbard X1 at Spectacular Motors. Mary tells Rachel to photo shop a picture of the Sydney Cignets team next to a fleet of Svalbard X1s. Mary has not received authority to use the Sydney Cignets picture but she figures that as Svalbard is their official sponsor, it won’t be an issue. The website and the large billboard is launched on the Spectacular Motors website and on site, which reads:\nBuy a Svalbard X1 from Spectacular Motors ON SALE NOW $39,999.00*  Svalbard is the car of choice of the Sydney Cignets  Test Driven and approved by all Spectacular Motors directors\nWe guarantee our Svalbard X1’s will never let you down\nFor every purchased Svalbard, Spectacular Motors will do a same day oil change and safety check of your car for free, valid for a year\n*No refunds whatsoever or exchanges on sale items.\r\n10 customers have bought Svalbard cars and all of them now have been brought back for engine faults.\nDiscuss the potential liability of Mary, Mike and Rachel under the general consumer protection provisions of the Australian Consumer.\n\nMary can state that no change of mind sales, but not “no refunds”\n\ncannot state “will never let you down” coupled lack of refund “whatsoever”\n\ns 64 - cannot contract out exclusion clause\ns 29 (1)(m) - cannot hide warranty, etc\nunfair contract terms\nimplied invitation to treat\n\n\ns 18\n\nmisleading contact - sponsor of team does not mean car of choice, photoshopped team in\ncar of choice of the cignets\ns 29  False or misleading representations about goods or services\n\n(1)(g)-(h) - sponsorship deception\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRachel is likely violating copyright law - deceptive or misleading conduct\nMike has family relation\r\nProblem question 2\r\nThe Sun’s Out Guns Out gym membership contract contains the following terms:\nOnce a Membership Agreement has been entered into the agreement is binding even in the event of disability which prevents the member from attending the gym.\nIn the event the gym at which the agreement was executed ceases operation the member’s rights will be transferred to a neighbouring Sun’s Out Guns Out Gym location and the contractual obligations will remain.\nAt the expiry of the initial agreed term of the Membership Agreement when this Membership Agreement reverts to a month-to-month obligation Sun’s Out Guns Out Gym reserves the right to increase the monthly membership fee with at least 30 days’ notice.\nCancellation of the Membership Agreement may only be done in person at the premises where the contract was originally signed. A cancellation appointment must be made with the respective Sun’s Out Guns Out Gym. There is a cancellation fee of $200.\r\nAre these terms enforceable?\n\nProblem question 3\nSnake Oil Pty Ltd claims that they have an effective herbal acne cure. Their marketing is targeted at adolescents and their parents and emphasises the destructive impact of acne on self-esteem, confidence and social activity of school students. The product is only sold by consultants who visit the family home. The acne cure can only be purchased as an ongoing treatment regime which is paid by direct debit. The total cost can run into thousands of dollars. The consultants are trained to expound on the long term destructive outcomes of untreated acne in the presence of the parents and the afflicted teen together. The cure is not ineffective. However products which have similar properties costs only a few dollars.\nDo parties who enter into these contracts have a remedy under the Australian Consumer Law?\r\nif there was a remedy, it may be unconscionable if bargaining power is unveven ( s 22)\r\ns 22 (1)(d)\r\ns 22 (1)(e)\n \tUTS CRICOS PROVIDER CODE 00099F  \n\n70327\r\nIntroduction to Property and Commercial Law\nAUTUMN 2024 TUTORIAL GUIDE\r\n(Topics 10-12: PPSA)\nTable of Contents\r\nTopic 10: Personal Property Securities Act (Part 1)\t3\r\nThis topic covers\t3\r\nTo do before your tutorial\t3\r\nConceptual questions\t4\r\nProblem questions\t4\r\nProblem question 1\t4\r\nProblem question 2 (Case study continuation)\t5\r\nTopic 11: Personal Property Securities Act (Part 2)\t7\r\nThis topic covers\t7\r\nTo do before your tutorial\t7\r\nConceptual questions\t7\r\nProblem questions\t8\r\nProblem question 1\t8\r\nProblem question 2\t9\r\nTopic 12: Personal Property Securities Act (Part 3)\t10\r\nThis topic covers\t10\r\nTo do before your tutorial\t10\r\nProblem questions\t10\r\nProblem question 1 - Priority Exercise - Moss, Big Bank and Fast Cars.\t10\r\nProblem question 2 - Aztec Mining Ltd\t12\r\nProblem question 3 - Sunsafe\t13\nTopic 10: Personal Property Securities Act (Part 1)\nThis topic covers\n\nOverview of the Personal Property Securities Act (PPSA)\nSecurity Interests under the PPSA\nCreating and enforcing a Security Interest Under the PPSA\n\nTo do before your tutorial\n\n\nRead: Text ch 5 [5.10] - [5.250] and reading materials on UTS Online and the cases\n\n\nDura (Australia) Constructions Pty Ltd v Hue Boutique Living Pty Ltd (2014) 292 FLR 114; [2014] VSCA 326;\n\n\nRe Arcabi Pty Ltd (in liq) (2014) 288 FLR 236 and  - Re Maiden (2013) 277 FLR 337; [2013] NSWSC 852.\r\nYou must download or have access to the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 (Cth) and read the sections of the Act referred to in the lecture podcast.\n\n\nWatch: Lecture Podcast: PPSA Part 1\n\n\nPrepare: Go through and think about the conceptual and problem questions.

Week 10 tutorial leaders will be asked questions about the allocated readings, including the cases of the week.\n\n\nConceptual questions\n\n\nWhat are some of the features of the PPSA that make it a different system to the prior law for security over personal property?\n\nThe Personal Property Securities Act (PPSA) introduced a single, national online register for security interests in personal property, creating a more transparent and accessible system, replacing the fragmented framework of various registers and laws that previously governed securities over personal property in Australia.\n\nnot a complete code\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the elements of the definition of a security interest under the PPSA?\n\n\nIn sub-stance security interest def – section 12(1)\n\n‘A security interest means an interest in personal property provided for by a transaction that, in substance, secures payment or performance of an obligation (without regard to the form of the transaction or the identity of the person who has title to the property).’\nElements:\n\n(i) an interest in personal property,\n(ii) provided for by a transaction (this involves a consensual dealing –\n\nsee Dura [2014] VSCA 326\n\n\n(iii) interest provided by the transaction secures the payment or performance of an obligation (as a matter of substance rather than form).\n\n\nSpecific examples - section 12(2)\nEven if the arrangement satisfies section 12(1), it may be excluded by section 8\n\n\n\nWhat are some of the forms of personal property that are excluded by the PPSA?\n\n\nExclusions from the PPSA – section 8\n\nStatutory security interests (e.g. arising under tax laws) – s 8(1)(b)\nSecurity interests by operation of law (e.g. liens) – s 8(1)(c)\nInterests in land and fixtures – ss 8(1)(f)(i)-(ii), s8(1)(j)\n\nForge Group Power P/L v General Electric [2016] NSWSC 52\n\n\nSpecial purpose trusts (Quistclose trusts) – s 8(1)(h)\n\nThis does not mean all trusts are excluded but typical private trust most likely won’t involve a security interest anyway although a trust may be set up as a security arrangement – e.g. in certain corporate finance transactions\n\n\nCommonwealth and state laws may exclude property from the PPSA – e.g. mining and fishing licenses\nNote: s 8(2) may apply some PPSA provisions*\n\n\n\nHow are supplies of goods under retention of title arrangements covered by the PPSA?\n\n\nSecurity Interest in Retention of Title\n\nSupply of goods subject to retention of title creates an ‘in substance’ security interest under section 12(1)\nSupplier is treated as the secured party\nSupplier’s title to goods is treated by PPSA as a security interest\nSupplier’s title is not enough to protect them in a PPSA priority contest\n\n\n\n\nWhat  is  the  difference  between  attachment  and  perfection  of  a  security interest?\n\n\nAttachment of a security interest occurs when it becomes enforceable against the debtor with respect to the collateral, whereas perfection occurs when the security interest is made enforceable against third parties and is typically achieved through registration, possession, or control of the collateral.\n\n\nSection 19: Attachment elements required for enforceability\n\nSection 19(2) Security interest attaches to collateral when: the grantor has rights in the collateral (or the power to transfer rights in the collateral to the secured party);\n\nand either (i) value is given for the security interest;\nor (ii) the grantor does an act by which the security interest arises.\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 20: Enforceability of security interests against third parties\n\nSection 20(1) Security interest is enforceable against a third party if:\n\n(a) security interest is attached to the collateral; and\n(b) one of the following applies:\n\n(i) the secured party possesses the collateral;\n(ii) the secured party has perfected the security interest by control;\n(iii) a security agreement that provides for the security interest covers the collateral in accordance with s 20(2).\n\n\n\n\nSection 20(2) Security agreement –\n\n(a) evidenced by writing signed by grantor (or adopted or accepted by grantor);\n(b) contains description of collateral\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 21: Perfection (main rule)\n\nPerfection by registration, possession, control.\n\n\n\nWhat forms of property may be used as collateral?\n\n\ncommon types of collateral\n\nAll assets (both present and future)\nGoods (including goods held as inventory)\nAccounts (book debts – accounts receivable)\nMotor vehicles (may be described by serial number)\nNegotiable instruments\nIntellectual property (may be described by serial number, except copyright)\nInvestment instruments (shares, debentures)\nChattel paper (instrument that evidences a debt combined with a security right in goods – e.g. hire purchase agreement)\nChattel paper is itself collateral (i.e. separate from the security interest in the goods)\n\nContrast with accounts receivable (i.e. debt obligation only) either account OR chattel paper\nChattel paper has special priority rules\n\n\nNOTE: Different registration requirements apply depending on whether commercial or consumer property (see s 153(1) item 4)\n\n\n\nFormal classes of collateral under PPSA\n\nA financing statement (i.e. the PPSR registration form) must place collateral into a single class of collateral: PPS Regs Sch 1 item 2.3\n(1)\n\n(a) Agriculture (see reg 1.6);\n(b) Aircraft (see reg 1.6);\n(c) ‘all present and after-acquired property’(see reg 1.6);\n(d) ‘all present and after-acquired property, except’ (see reg 1.6);\n(e) financial property (see s 10);\n(f) intangible property (see s 10);\n(g) motor vehicles (see reg 1.7);\n(h) other goods;\n(i) watercraft (see reg 1.6).\n\n\n(2)  In paragraph(1)(h): other goods means personal property that is goods, other than agriculture, aircraft, motor vehicles and watercraft.\n\n\n\nProblem questions\nProblem question 1\nConsider whether the following arrangements may involve any PPSA security interests:\n\nA dry cleaner retains an expensive suit when the customer does not pay his cleaning bill.\r\nWhat if the retention of the suit is allowed under an express term of the cleaning contract?\n\ns 12(3)(c) the interest of a lessor or bailor of goods under a PPS lease.\n\n\nLeaseCo supplies industrial exhaust systems for a bakery that cost $100,000. The bakery is paying off the purchase in monthly instalments and LeaseCo has the right to remove the items if payment falls into arrears. The exhaust systems are built into the ceiling of the premises, and are expensive to remove (but the lessee would bear this cost anyway).\n\nLease co is the secured party\nthe bakery is the debtor\nthe exhaust systems are the collateral\nfixtures under s 8 (j)\n\n\nTravel Co maintains a trust account for its clients who have suffered cancelled flights or accommodation.

What advantages apply to classifying a security interest as a PMSI under the Personal Property Securities Act?\nWhat  is  the  relationship  between  the  enforcement  provisions  of  the National Credit Code and the Personal Property Securities Act?\n\nProblem questions\nProblem question 1\nMick runs a horse stud near Goulburn where his business provides breeding services for the surrounding farms. Mick is leasing the rural land under a long-term lease. Mick has 50,000 in his bank account with GBank Ltd (a large finance company operating in town), plus miscellaneous equipment (not fixtures) valued at 150,000. Mick also has an outstanding business loan with GBank worth 300,000 which is covered by a security interest granted by Mick over all of his present and after acquired property. The business loan is part of an ongoing facility used for general business purposes. GBank registers a financing statement to cover security interest in the loan to Mick on 1 August 2015.   \r\nMick wants to lease some new equipment valued at a total package of 100,000 from LeaseCo to assist in growing his business. The leasing arrangement includes a maintenance and insurance charge worth 20,000 over the life of the lease and equipment with a market value of 80,000. LeaseCo registers a financing statement to cover its position on 1 September 2015.\nUnfortunately Mick’s business expansion does not go well and he defaults on all of his obligations (to LeaseCo and GBank). Mick is hopeful that he business can pay back the loans but both LeaseCo and GBank seek to enforce rights against Mick’s assets. Mick sells one of the major pieces of equipment to a related entity MFarm Ltd for $5,000 (which is below market value).\nAdvise  LeaseCo  and  GBank  as  to  their  priority  rights  (if  any)  under  the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 (Cth).\nIn answering this question disregard Mick’s interests in real property only. Assume that none of the collateral covered by the security interests is serial numbered property or is comingled goods, accessions, crops or livestock. There is no need to discuss the enforcement provisions under Chapter 4 of the Personal Property Securities Act.\nProblem question 2\nJavier is a car salesman with Spectacular Motors. Javier has recently dealt with a customer Max Smith. Max has traded in his Lexus for a value of 80,000 and purchased a new Lexus from Spectacular Motors for 100,000 (with 80,000 coming from the trade in and the balance provided by finance from Spectacular Motors) Javier runs a PPSR search using the VIN for the trade in car and for Max Smith as grantor and nothing shows up.   \r\nIn fact, the vehicle is collateral for finance obtained by Max from LeaseCo. However, LeaseCo made an error when it recorded its interest on the PPSR for the vehicle by mixing up 2 numbers in the VIN. (Note: Spectacular Motors does not need to record a security interest against the trade in car because Spectacular Motors now owns the vehicle). Spectacular Motors registers a security interest against Max&#039;s new car and records the VIN correctly. Max then gives the car to Aaron (his son) as a gift, and Aaron has an outstanding bank loan covering all present and after acquired property with Eastbank Ltd (which a proper PPSR registration). When Aaron defaults on his bank loan Eastbank seizes the new car.   \r\nSpectacular Motors sells Max&#039;s trade in vehicle to Vivian for 90,000, and provides Vivian with finance for the purchase. Spectacular Motors records a security interest in Vivian’s car on the PPSR. Vivan then loses the car in a bet with Walter (Vivian has a chronic gambling problem) at an illegal casino.\nWho has priority to the 2 cars (new $100k Lexus and Max’s original trade in vehicle) under the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 (Cth)?\nTopic 12: Personal Property Securities Act (Part 3)\nThis topic covers\n\nEnforcement under the PPSA\nBringing it all together\n\nTo do before your tutorial\n\nRe-read: Text ch 5 and revise PPSA Part 1 and 2.\r\nYou must download or have access to the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 (Cth) and read the sections of the Act referred to in the lecture podcast.\nWatch: Lecture Podcast: PPSA Part 3\nPrepare: Go through and think about the conceptual and problem questions. Be prepared to work through these in class. Whether online or face to face, be prepared for your tutor to ask you to contribute or answer questions.\nThere are no tutorial leaders - this is a final revision class for all students to bring questions.\n\nProblem questions\nProblem question 1 - Priority Exercise - Moss, Big Bank and Fast Cars.\nOn 1 March, Moss enters a financing arrangement with Big Bank. Big Bank takes an ‘all present and after acquired property’ (AllPAP) security interest in all of Moss’s present and after acquired property and registers a financing statement on the same day.    On 2 March, Moss buys some office equipment.\nOn 3 March, Moss deposits some money into its everyday bank account with Big Bank.\n\nIdentify what security interests exist. When to they attach? When are they perfected?\n\nMoss would like to sell a new range of cars manufactured by Fast Cars. Fast Cars agrees to consign the cars to Moss on retention of title terms and Moss is allowed to possess the cars and is given authority to deal with them in the ordinary course of business. The contract is signed on 8 March and Fast Cars registers a financing statement that same day.\n\nWhich security interest will have priority?\n\nOn 1 April Moss enters into a three year operating lease to lease a computer and IT network from Office Leasing. Office Leasing registers a financing statement on 1 April.\n\nDoes Big Bank’s security interest attach to this equipment supplied under an operating lease?\nDoes Big Bank’s security interest have priority over Office Leasing’s interest?\n\nMoss sells a car consigned to it by Fast Cars. Moss deposits the proceeds into its general operating account at Big Bank.\n\nDoes Fast Car’s security interest continue in the proceeds of the sale?\n\nMelissa is a customer of Moss/Spectacular Motors who has bought one of the cars consigned by Fast Cars to Moss. Fast Cars asserts that its security interest continues in the car that Melissa has bought.\n\nAdvise Melissa on her rights.\n\nProblem question 2 - Aztec Mining Ltd\nJenny is the general manager of Aztec Mining Ltd which is a mining services company that operates in the Hunter Valley in NSW. Aztec’s assets include 20 large industrial vehicles that are worth 100,000 each. The vehicles have huge tyres that are removable and are valued at 5,000 each.\nThe vehicles are covered by a 5-year finance lease with LeaseCo. LeaseCo’s contract with Aztec provides that LeaseCo has a security interest over all present and after acquired property of Aztec in order to pay off its lease contracts over the vehicles. LeaseCo registers a financing statement on the PPSR which states that it has a PMSI over the vehicles on 1 February 2015 (a claim for proceeds is also made on the financing statement).\nLeaseCo’s finance manager is concerned about the security over other assets so LeaseCo registers another financing statement on the PPSR on 20 February 2015 which states that LeaseCo has a PMSI on all of Aztec’s equipment. A third financing statement is also registered on the PPSR by LeaseCo on 20 February 2015 covering all present and after acquired property of Aztec (no PMSI is claimed).\nAztec however obtains types from TCo Ltd which is a specialised industrial tyre company.\r\nThe contract between Aztec and TCo includes a retention of title clause which provides that TCo retains title to the tyres until payment is made in full. The supply agreement also provides that Aztec must set aside 10,000 into a separate bank account with Ebank (not Aztec&#039;s normal bank) which can be used by TCo to pay its invoices if Aztec is more than 30 days late. TCo registers a financing statement over the tyres and any proceeds as a PMSI on 2 February 2015. TCo&#039;s financing statement mistakenly describes Aztec Mining Ltd (the grantor) as &#039;Aztorq Mining Services&#039; but the Australian Company Number is correct and this is what is used to search for the grantor.  Aztec has an ongoing loan facility with Westbank which covers all present and after acquired property and was registered on the PPSR on 1 January 2015.    \r\nAssume that Aztec gets into financial trouble and sells 10 industrial vehicles at a discount in order to generate 750,000 (assume that this is permitted under the terms of the lease and supply agreements). Aztec deposits this in its bank account with Westbank. This is in breach of its contract with TCo which takes enforcement action by writing to Aztec demanding the immediate payment of outstanding amounts or the tyres will be repossessed (as is permitted under TCo’s contract).\n\nWhat rights does TCo have?\nAssess the priority position under the PPSA between Westbank and LeaseCo.\n\nProblem question 3 - Sunsafe\nSunsafe Pty Ltd (Sunsafe) is a zinc mining company in South Australia. While zinc prices have been falling Sunsafe had calculated that increasing output would enable them to maintain profits. The strategy required acquiring further equipment. Sunsafe contacted businesses which had access to the sorts of equipment it needed.\nHard Rock Imports Pty Ltd (Hard Rock) usually only imported equipment to sell to mining equipment hire companies. But considering Sunsafe’s circumstances agreed to draw up a one-off lease agreement at 10,000 per month to hire a Caterpillar 797 dump truck. The lease was for two years with an option for a third.    \r\nTonka Pty Ltd was a mining equipment hire and sale business which had a Komatsu 960 dump truck which was also leased to Sunsafe at 10,000 per month over an initial period of 2 years with an option to extend the lease after 2 years. There was also an option to purchase the equipment for a fixed amount at the end of the lease. In the agreement the lessee was prohibited from disposing of the Komatsu to a third party unless the option to buy had been exercised and title transferred.\nTonka Pty Ltd also had an Hitachi EH5000 dump truck for hire. Sunsafe were not sure how long they would need to use the truck so they entered into a monthly rental agreement with Tonka Pty Ltd for 10,000 per month. The lease contract allowed the lessee to extend the lease at the end of each month which Sunsafe has done for 18 months.    \r\nSunsafe planned to secure further finance secured by possession of the trucks and other equipment.    \r\nShark Finance advanced Sunsafe a further line of credit to fund the lease of the Hitachi. Shark Finance would have liked its lending to be secured against all of Sunsafe&#039;s current and future assets.- NOT AN ALLPAAP    \r\nSunsafe banks with Bigbucks Bank, an approved deposit taking institution. There is 1 million in the account.  Sunsafe has an outstanding business loan with Bigbucks Bank worth 400,000. The business loan is part of an ongoing facility for general business purposes.    Unfortunately the investment in extra equipment did not boost productivity sufficiently to overcome the fall in zinc prices. Sunsafe was in default of its lease agreements with Tonka. Tonka repossessed the Hitachi and sold it to Ironclad Pty Ltd (Ironclad), another mining company for 4 million.\nWith Sunsafe facing insolvency and creditors lining up, advise each of the following as to what they could have and should have done, if anything, to protect their respective interests in Sunsafe assets pursuant to the operation of the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 and justify the advice.\n\n\nSunsafe\n\n\nHard Rock\n\n\nType: traditional lease\n\n\nSecured party: Hard Rock\n\n\nGrantor: Sunspot\n\n\ncollateral: Caterpillar 797 dump truck\n\n\nexempt s 8: no\n\n\ndeemed security interes 12(3)\n\npps lease\nLease or bailment of goods: for a term of more than 2 years or indefinite term where possession maintained for more than two years.\nIN THIS INSTANCE, HARD ROCK IS NOT in the business of leasing or bailing goods (s 13(2))\n\n\n\nTonka\n\n\nType: traditional lease\n\n\nSecured party: Tonka\n\n\nGrantor: Sunspot\n\n\nCollateral:Komatsu 960 dump truck\n\n\nexempt s 8: no\n\n\nin substance and deemed security interest under s 12(3) - white v spiers\n\n\nregistration is unknown\n\n\ns 19 is assumed as value is given and tonka owns property and cannot dispose until buyout option is excercised\n\n\nshould register with pssa, unknown\n\n\ncollateral:  Hitachi EH5000 repossessed it\n\n\nexempt s 8: no\n\n\nno security interest - hire lease\n\n\nregistration is unknown\n\n\nIronclad\n\n\ns 49   A person who buys an investment instrument or an intermediated security in the ordinary course of trading on a prescribed financial market (within the meaning of the Corporations Act 2001 ) takes the instrument or intermediated security free of a security interest in the instrument or intermediated security.\n\n\nBigbucks\n\n\nADI - s 75\n\n\nTo avoid doubt, a perfected security interest, held by an ADI, in an ADI account with the ADI has priority over any other perfected security interest in the ADI account.\n\n\nShould state that they have control\n\n\nShark Finance\n\nnot an allpaap, would have liked\nshould have registered at PPSR\n\n\n"},"UTS-Law-Notes/Networking-Notes":{"title":"Networking Notes","links":["tags/tag-notes","tags/tag-tutorial","tags/s"],"tags":["tag-notes","tag-tutorial","s"],"content":"tag-notestag-tutorial\n\n\nCalculating Packet delay\n\nSuppose within your Web browser you click on a link to obtain a Web page. The IP address for the associated URL is not cached in your local host, so a DNS lookup is necessary to obtain the IP address. Suppose that a DNS server is visited with RTT1=1.2ms before your host receives the IP address from DNS. Further suppose that the Web page associated with the link contains exactly one object, consisting of a small amount of HTML text. Let RTT0=5.1ms denote the RTT between the local host and the server containing the object. Assuming zero transmission time and processing time of the object, how much time elapses from when the client clicks on the link until the client receives the html object?\n(please fill in numbers in millisecond (ms) in the space provided.)\n\nA: Time to receive the html object\n\na. Time to receive the object\n\nTo get the IP address, it takes RTT1. Once the IP address is known, it takes RTT0 to set up the TCP connection and another RTT0 to request and receive the small object. The total response time is\nRTT1+2RTT0=1.2+2*5.1=11.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, suppose the HTML file references 6 image objects on the same server. The transmission time of each image object is 3 ms.

Seq-C: _ _ _\nD. ACK-D: _ _ _\nE. Seq-E: _ _ _\nF. ACK-F: _ _ _\n\n\nAnswer\n\n2a:  Seq-A = SendBase (client) = 50\n2b: ACK-B = SendBase (server) = 90\n2c:  client is acknowledging the receipt of the server’s data. Therefore: Seq-C = ACK-B = 90\n2d: server is acknowledging the receipt of the client’s data. Therefore: ACK-D = Seq-A  + data length = 50 + 8 = 58\n2e: client is acknowledging the receipt of the server’s data. Therefore: Seq-E = ACK-D = 58\n2f: server is acknowledging the receipt of the client’s data. Therefore: ACK-F = Seq-C + data length = 90 + 8 = 98\n\n\nQuestion 4:\n\nThe source Host A is going to send 5KB (5120byte) of data to the destination Host B over an established TCP connection, which has a window size (rwnd) of 4KB (4096byte) and a maximum segment size (MSS) of 1KB (1024byte). Assuming Go-Back-N is used in TCP.\nSuppose there are errors in the transmissions. For each of the following independent transmission error cases, please calculate the total number of segments sent out from the source (including retransmissions) in order to complete the transmissions of the 5KB data to the destination.\n\nCase A.

While it does not confer full sovereignty, it allows states to protect their interests just beyond their territorial boundaries, balancing their rights with the freedoms of other states on the high seas.\n\n\nJoyce v DPP [1946] AC 347\n\n\nPassive Personality Principle:\n\nStates may claim jurisdiction over acts committed abroad that harm their nationals.\nUS v Yunis (No.2)\n\n\n\n\nFive heads of jurisdiction recognized by international law\n\nTerritorial Jurisdiction: Authority over acts committed within a state’s own territory.\nNationality (or Active Personality) Jurisdiction: Authority over a state’s nationals, regardless of where they are located.\nPassive Personality Jurisdiction: Authority over acts committed abroad that harm the state’s nationals.\nProtective Jurisdiction: Authority over acts outside a state’s territory that threaten its security or governmental functions.\nUniversal Jurisdiction: Authority over certain serious crimes (e.g., genocide, war crimes) that are recognized as affecting the international community as a whole, regardless of where they occur.\n\n\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969 (VCLT)\n\nVCLT is considered the ‘Treaty on Treaties’ and as such, provides the principles of law relating to the drafting, application and interpretation of other treaties.\nIt is largely recognised as the pre-eminent statement on the law of treaties, even by those States who are not parties to the Convention.\nCodification of Customary International Law\n\n\nbasic elements of a treaty?\nElements of treaty making\n\nProposal for a treaty\nCapacity to conclude treaties\nAdoption of the text\nAuthentication of the text\nConsent to be bound\n\n\n\nHead of State and Government Officials:\n\nAbsolute Immunity: Heads of state, heads of government, and foreign ministers typically enjoy absolute immunity from the jurisdiction of foreign courts while they are in office. This immunity covers all acts, both official and private, and is not subject to exceptions, even for alleged violations of international law.\nInternational Customary Law: This immunity is recognized under customary international law and is grounded in the need to protect the sovereignty and effective governance of states.\n\n\nActs Performed in an Official Capacity:\n\nFunctional Immunity (Immunity Ratione Materiae): After leaving office, former officials (including foreign ministers) retain immunity for acts performed in their official capacity. This type of immunity, known as “functional immunity,” protects them from legal actions related to their official acts while in office, as these acts are considered acts of the state itself.\nPersonal Immunity (Immunity Ratione Personae): While in office, these officials also enjoy “personal immunity,” which is broader and covers all acts, official or personal.

Thus there are two factors in the formation of custom:\n\n\n\na material fact-the repetition of similar acts by states, and\n\n\n\n\na psychological element usually called the opinion juris sive necessitates the feeling on the part of the States that in acting as they act, they are fulfilling a legal obligation” (Greig 1976)\n\n\n\n\nTwo elements.

Germany had not yet ratified the treaty. Could only apply if the rule was also Customary International Law.\nHeld: “…two conditions must be fulfilled. Not only must the acts concerned amount to a settled practice, but they must also be such, or be carried out in such a way, as to be evidence of a belief that this practice is rendered obligatory by the existence of a rule of Iaw requiring it. The need for such a belief, i.e., the existence of a subjective element, is implicit in the very notion of the opinio juris sive necessitatis. The States concerned must therefore feel that they are conforming to what amounts to a legal obligation. The frequency, or even habitual character of the acts is not in itself enough. There are many international acts, e.g., in the field of ceremonial and protocol, which are performed almost invariably, but which are motivated only by considerations of courtesy, convenience or tradition, and not by any sense of legal duty”. (para 77)\n“As regards the time element, the Court notes that it is over ten years since the Convention was signed, but that it is even now less than five since it came into force in June 1964, and that when the present proceedings were brought it was less than three years, while less than one had elapsed at the time when the respective negotiations between the Federal Republic and the other two Parties for a complete delimitation broke down on the question of the application of the equidistance principle. Although the passage of only a short period of time is not necessarily, or of itself, a bar to the formation of a new rule of customary international law on the basis of what was originally a purely conventional rule, an indispensable requirement would be that within the period in question, short though it might be, State practice, including that of States whose interests are specially affected, should have been both extensive and virtually uniform in the sense of the provision invoked;-and should moreover have occurred in such a way as to show a general recognition that a rule of law or legal obligation is involved.”\nequidistance principle def, or principle of equidistance def,\n\na legal concept in maritime boundary claims that a nation’s maritime boundaries should conform to a median line that is equidistant from the shores of neighboring nations.\n\n\n\n\nLotus case (France v Turkey) (1927) PCIJ, Ser.A, no.10\n\nA French vessel The Lotus collided on the high seas with a Turkish vessel the Boz-Kourt. 8 passengers and crew were killed. When the ship docked in Turkey, Turkish authorities arrested the French officer of the watch. Key issue was whether Turkey had jurisdiction to prosecute him for manslaughter?\nFrance argued that because there had been so few examples of criminal prosecutions of other states ‘flagged vessels’ this demonstrated the existence of a principle of customary international law that only the ‘flag state’ had exclusive jurisdiction.\nCourt held that needed to show a subjective element stating\n[absence of other states exercising jurisdiction would] “merely show that States had often, in practice, abstained from instituting criminal proceedings, and not that they recognised themselves as being obliged to do so; for only is such abstention were based on their being conscious of having a duty to abstain would it be possible to speak of an international custom…”\n\n\nILC Conclusions, Part 3: A General Practice\n\nConclusion 4\nRequirement of practice\n\nI.

This proposed union raised significant concerns among other European states, leading to what was described as a “European crisis.”\nThe Council of the League of Nations requested an advisory opinion from the PCIJ to determine whether the proposed customs union would violate international obligations under the Treaty of Saint-Germain and the Protocol of 1922.\n\n\nFacts:\n\nThe Treaty of Saint-Germain (1919) included Article 88, which asserted that Austria’s independence was inalienable without the consent of the League of Nations.\n\nAustria also undertook not to compromise its independence in any way.\n\n\nThe 1922 Protocol reinforced Austria’s economic independence, imposing further restrictions on any actions that might undermine its sovereign status.\n\n\nLegal Issue:\n\nWhether Austria’s agreement with Germany to form a customs union would violate Article 88 of the Treaty of Saint-Germain and the 1922 Protocol, thereby compromising Austria’s independence.\n\n\nDecision:\n\nThe PCIJ, by a narrow margin of eight votes to seven, advised that the proposed customs union would be incompatible with the Protocol of 1922.\nAdditionally, a majority of the judges opined (though not as a formal ruling of the Court) that the customs union would also contravene Article 88 of the Treaty of Saint-Germain.\n\n\nRatio Decidendi:\n\nThe Court emphasized that Austria’s independence, as protected by Article 88, meant that Austria had to remain a separate state with full control over its own economic, political, and financial affairs.\nThe establishment of the customs union was seen as a potential step toward political union, which would undermine Austria’s sovereignty by subjecting its decisions to German influence.\n\n\nSignificance:\n\nThe Austro-German Customs Union Case is significant for its interpretation of state sovereignty and independence in international law.\nThe decision underscored the importance of maintaining a state’s independence from external control, especially in situations where economic agreements could lead to political subordination.\nThis case is frequently cited in discussions of state sovereignty and the limitations imposed by international treaties on a state’s ability to enter into agreements that may compromise its independence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFRENCH INDEMNITY OF 1831\nFRENCH INDEMNITY OF 1831 US Claims Commission. Moore, 5\n\nProcedural History:\n\nAfter the Napoleonic Wars, France agreed to pay compensation to the United States for damages suffered by American nationals.\nThe US Claims Commission was established to distribute these funds and determine France’s liability, particularly regarding losses caused by other nations under French influence.\n\n\nFacts:\n\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars, Holland was a nominally independent state but came under substantial French control, particularly after 1806 when Napoleon’s brother, Louis Bonaparte, was installed as the king of Holland.\nBy 1810, Holland was formally annexed into the French Empire.\nAmerican merchants suffered losses due to the sequestration of their goods in Dutch ports, which was ordered by France under the Franco-Dutch treaty.\nDenmark, while maintaining formal independence, engaged in actions that harmed U.S. nationals, likely motivated by the desire to align with French interests or gain favor with Napoleon.\n\n\nLegal Issue:\n\nThe central question was whether France could be held liable for the actions of Holland and Denmark, given the extent of France’s control or influence over these nations during the Napoleonic Wars.\n\n\nDecision:\n\nThe US Claims Commission ruled that France was liable for the damages caused by Holland, as Holland was effectively under French control and lacked true sovereignty.\nHowever, France was not held liable for the damages caused by Denmark, as Denmark was considered an independent state acting on its own accord.\n\n\nRatio Decidendi:\n\nThe decision was based on the principle that a state can be held responsible for the actions of another state if the latter is under its significant control or influence, to the point where it lacks genuine sovereignty.\nIn this case, Holland was deemed to be a dependent state under French control, making France liable for its actions.\nDenmark, however, retained enough independence to absolve France of responsibility.\n\n\nSignificance:\n\nThis case is significant in international law for its contribution to the understanding of state sovereignty and responsibility.\nIt highlights the conditions under which a state may be held liable for the actions of another state, particularly when issues of de facto control and influence are involved.\nThe case informs contemporary discussions on state responsibility, especially in contexts where one state exercises significant influence over another’s actions, and remains relevant in the context of modern international relations.\n\n\n\n\nC. Self-determination\nUnder the UN Charter, it became the cornerstone of the General Assembly’s decolonisation policy of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nthe principle has generated a rule of international law

of treaty law, although the meaning of the Covenant provisions may differ from that in customary international law.\n\n\nWestern Sahara Case (Advisory Opinion) [1975] ICJ Reports 12\n\nCourt: International Court of Justice (ICJ)\nParties:\n\nRequesting Party: United Nations General Assembly (seeking an advisory opinion).\nStates Involved: Morocco and Mauritania.\n\n\nProcedural History:\n\nIn 1966, the United Nations General Assembly called for the decolonization of Western Sahara, emphasizing the right to self-determination as per General Assembly Resolution 1514 (XV).\nSpain, the colonial power, agreed to hold a referendum under UN supervision in 1975.\nHowever, Morocco and Mauritania, both neighboring states, claimed historical ties to the territory and sought to assert their claims.\nThe General Assembly then requested an advisory opinion from the ICJ on two key questions regarding the status and legal ties of Western Sahara.\n\n\nFacts:\n\nWestern Sahara, also known as the Spanish Sahara, was colonized by Spain in 1884.\nThe territory, rich in phosphates and abundant in fishing resources, was sparsely populated, with a 1974 census recording a population of 74,900, mostly nomadic Saharan tribesmen.\nSpain’s colonization efforts met with opposition as the territory’s strategic and economic value became apparent, especially to Morocco, a competitor in the phosphates industry.\nBy the mid-20th century, the pressure for decolonization intensified, leading Spain to agree to a UN-supervised referendum.\nHowever, Morocco claimed the territory based on historic ties preceding Spanish colonization, with Mauritania making a similar overlapping claim.\n\n\nLegal Issue:\n\nThe ICJ was asked to address two primary questions:\n\nWhether Western Sahara (comprising the regions of Rio de Oro and Sakiet El Hamra) was, at the time of its colonization by Spain, a territory belonging to no one (terra nullius).\nIf the territory was not terra nullius, what were the legal ties between Western Sahara and the Kingdom of Morocco and the Mauritanian entity?\n\n\n\n\nDecision:\n\nThe ICJ concluded that Western Sahara was not terra nullius at the time of Spanish colonization.\nThe Court recognized that, although the territory was sparsely populated and had no formal state structures, the indigenous peoples had social and political organizations, and legal ties existed with Morocco and the Mauritanian entity.\nHowever, these ties did not amount to sovereignty, nor did they indicate that Morocco or Mauritania had ownership or control over Western Sahara at the time of colonization.\n\n\nRatio Decidendi:\n\nThe ICJ’s decision was based on the principle that territory cannot be considered terra nullius if it was inhabited by people with established social and political organization.\nThe presence of such structures, along with the acknowledgment of some degree of allegiance or authority (though not sovereignty) between Western Sahara’s inhabitants and Morocco/Mauritania, meant that the territory was not ownerless before Spanish colonization.\nHowever, the legal ties did not confer sovereignty or diminish the applicability of the right to self-determination.\n\n\nSignificance:\n\nThe ICJ’s advisory opinion reinforced the principle of self-determination in international law, affirming that the historical ties claimed by Morocco and Mauritania did not negate the right of the people of Western Sahara to decide their own future.\nThe ruling highlighted the limitations of historical claims in the face of contemporary international legal principles concerning decolonization and self-determination.\n\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nThe Court clarified that terra nullius cannot be claimed for territories with existing social and political organizations, even if those structures are informal or loosely connected.\nThe decision emphasized the primacy of self-determination over historical claims when it comes to decolonization.\n\n\nRelevance to Modern Law:\n\nThe Western Sahara case continues to influence international legal discourse on self-determination and the decolonization process.\nIt underscores the limitations of historical claims when weighed against the right of indigenous populations to determine their political status and future.\nThe ruling has implications for other territorial disputes where historic ties are invoked to override the right to self-determination.\n\n\n\n\nReference re Secession of Quebec\r\n- Supreme Court of Canada\r\n- the international law right to self-determination only generates, at best/ a right to external self-determination in situations of former colonies;\n\nwhere a people is oppressed, as for example under foreign military occupation; or where a definable group is denied meaningful access to government to pursue their political, economic, social and cultural development.\n\n\nD.

(including in particular those relating to the definition of terms) and translates the other treaty provisions into domestic law\n\n\nA new statutory regime\n\nA completely new statutory regime will normally be created where the subject area covered by the treaty has not previously been the subject of Commonwealth legislation or where there is a desire to emphasise the importance of a treaty and

It appears to have two main foundations:\n\n(a) It is necessary in the interest of justice to individuals having such transaction with states to allow them to bring such transactions before the courts.\n(b) To require a state to answer a claim based upon such transactions does not involve a challenge to or inquiry into any of sovereignty or government act of that state….neither a threat to the dignity of the state, nor any interference with its sovereign functions……commercial transaction…a commercial or private law, character…”\nPer Lord Wilberforce\n\n\n“… Clearly a breach of a contract of that character was within the area of private law…simply (i) whether it could be said that the relevant contract was concluded for governmental purposes, and (ii) whether it was relevant that governmental motives were advanced for breaching the contract…\n\nUnder the “restrictive” theory the court has first to characterise the activity into which the defendant state has entered.\nHaving done this, and (assumedly) found it to be of a commercial or private law, character, it may take the view that contractual breaches, or torts, prima facie fall within the same sphere of activity.\nIt should then be for the defendant state to make a case…that the act complained of is outside that sphere, and within that of sovereign action” Per Lord Wilberforce\n\n\n\n\nTrendex Trading Corp v Central Bank of Nigeria [1977] Q.B. 529\n\n“…The doctrine grants immunity to a foreign government or its department of state or any body which can be regarded as an “alter ego or organ” of the government…. I confess that I can think of no satisfactory test except that of looking to the functions and control of the organisation. I do not think that it should depend on the foreign law alone.

Methods may include:\n\nSignature - Art 12 VCLT\nExchange of Instruments - Art 13 VCLT\nRatification, acceptance or approval - Art 14 VCLT\nAccession - Art 15\n\n\nIn Australia (and many other countries) the normal process is to sign the treaty to show the acceptance of text of the treaty. The treaty then needs to come back to government to decide whether to accept or reject the treaty.\nIf accepted by the government, domestic legislation will be enacted and the treaty will be expressed in municipal law.  This domestic act of ‘ratification’ is required before the Australian government will take any binding action.\n\nWhen a State becomes a signatory to a treaty, it declares its intention to make the terms of the treaty legally binding on itself, but generally the act of ‘signing’ itself does not make that act binding – depends on state practices and also entry into force requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\nRatifying, accepting, approving or acceding to a multilateral treaty\n\nEntry into force\n\nObligation prior to entry into force\nPacta sunt servanda\nRelation with internal law\nNon-retroactivity\nTerritorial application\nSuccessive treaties on same subject (or inconsistent treaties)\nArticle 24\n\n\n\nA treaty enters into force in such manner and upon such date as it may provide or as the negotiating States may agree.\n\n\n\n\nFailing any such provision or agreement, a treaty enters into force as soon as consent to be bound by the treaty has been established for all the negotiating States.\n\n\n\n\nWhen the consent of a State to be bound by a treaty is established on a date after the treaty has come into force, the treaty enters into force for that State on that date, unless the treaty otherwise provides.\n\n\n\n\nThe provisions of a treaty regulating the authentication of its text, the establishment of the consent of States to be bound by the treaty, the manner or date of its entry into force, reservations, the functions of the depositary and other matters arising necessarily before the entry into force of the treaty apply from the time of the adoption of its text.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPacta sunt servanda\n\nWhen a State ratifies a treaty, it makes the terms of the treaty legally binding, once the treaty’s requirements for entry into force are met.\nThere is a general principle that says once a State has signed a treaty, it is obliged to refrain from acts which would defeat the object and purpose of the treaty until it shall have made its intention clear not to become a party to the treaty.  (VCLT Art. 18)\nThis follows the maxim pacta sunt servanda (the agreement must be observed / honoured)\nArticle 26- Every treaty in force is binding upon the  parties to it and must be performed by them in good faith.\n\n\nRelation with internal law\n\nArticle 27\n\nA party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty. This rule is without prejudice to article 46.\n\n\nArticle 46\n\n\n\nA State may not invoke the fact that its consent to be bound by a treaty has been expressed in violation of a provision of its internal law regarding competence to conclude treaties as invalidating its consent unless that violation was manifest and concerned a rule of its internal law of fundamental importance.\n\n\n\n\nA violation is manifest if it would be objectively evident to any State conducting itself in the matter in accordance with normal practice and in good faith.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-retroactivity\n\nArticle 28\n\nUnless a different intention appears from the treaty or is otherwise established, its provisions do not bind a party in relation to any act or fact which took place or any situation which ceased to exist before the date of the entry into force of the treaty with respect to that party.\n\n\n\n\nTerritorial application\n\nArticle 29\n\nUnless a different intention appears from the treaty or is otherwise established, a treaty is binding upon each party in respect of its entire territory.\n\n\n\n\nSuccessive treaties on same subject\n\nArticle 30\n\n\n\nSubject to Article 103 of UN Charter…\n\n\n\n\nWhen a treaty specifies that it is subject to, or that it is not to be considered as incompatible with, an earlier or later treaty, the provisions of that other treaty prevail.\n\n\n\n\nWhen all the parties to the earlier treaty are parties also to the later treaty but the earlier treaty is not terminated or suspended in operation under article 59, the earlier treaty applies only to the extent that its provisions are compatible with those of the latter treaty.\n\n\n\n\nWhen the parties to the later treaty do not include all the parties to the earlier one:\n\n\n(a) as between States parties to both treaties the same rule applies as in paragraph 3; (b) as between a State party to both treaties and a State party to only one of the treaties, the treaty to which both States are parties governs their mutual rights and obligations.\n\n\n\n\nParagraph 4 is without prejudice to article 41, or to any question of the termination or suspension of the operation of a treaty under article 60 ….\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepository\n\nArticle 82\n\nRatification\nThe present Convention is subject to ratification.

Serious breaches of obligations under peremptory norms of general international law\n\nArticle 40: Application of this chapter\n\n\n\nThis chapter applies to the international responsibility which is entailed by a serious breach by a State of an obligation arising under a peremptory norm of general international law.\n\n\n\n\nA breach of such an obligation is serious if it involves a gross or systematic failure by the responsible State to fulfil the obligation.\n\n\n\n\nArticle 41: Particular Consequences of a Serious Breach of an Obligation under this Chapter\n\nStates shall cooperate to bring to an end through lawful means any serious breach within the meaning of article 40.\nNo State shall recognize as lawful a situation created by a serious breach within the meaning of article 40, nor render aid or assistance in maintaining that situation.\nThis article is without prejudice to the other consequences referred to in this part and to such further consequences that a breach to which this chapter applies may entail under international law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvocation of Responsibility\n\nArticle 42: Invocation by Injured State\n\nA state is entitled as an injured State to invoke the responsibility of another State if the obligation breached is owed to:\n\n(a) that state individually; or\n(b) a group of states including that State, or the international community as a whole,\nand the breach of the obligation:\n(i) specially affects that state; or\n(ii) is of such a character as radically to change the position of all the other states to which the obligation is owed with respect to the further performance of the obligation.\n\n\n\n\nArticle 46 Plurality of Injured States\n\nWhere several States are injured by the same internationally wrongful act, each injured State may separately invoke the responsibility of the State which has committed the internationally wrongful act.\n\n\nArticle 47 Plurality of Responsible States\n\nWhere several States are responsible for the same internationally wrongful act, the responsibility of each State may be invoked in relation to that act.\nParagraph 1:\n\n(a) does not permit any injured State to recover, by way of compensation, more than the damage it has suffered;\n(b) is without prejudice to any right of recourse against the other responsible States.\n\n\n\n\nArticle 45: Loss of the Right to Invoke Responsibility\nArticle 48: Invocation by a State other than an injured State\n\n\n\nAny state other than an injured state is entitled to invoke the responsibility of another state in accordance with paragraph 2 if:\n\n\n(a) the obligation breached is owed to a group of States including that State, and is established for the protection of a collective interest of the group; or\n(b) the obligation breached is owed to the international community as a whole.\n\n\n\n\nAny state entitled to invoke responsibility under paragraph 1 may claim from the responsible state:\n\n\n(a) cessation of the internationally wrongful act, and assurances and guarantees of non-repetition in accordance with article 30; and\n(b) performance of the obligation of reparation in accordance with the preceding articles, in the interest of the injured state or of the beneficiaries of the obligation breached.\n\n\n\n\nApplication of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (The Gambia v Myanmar) (Provisional Measures [2020] ICJ Reports 3\n\n\nMultilateral Public Order and Issues of Responsibility\n\nSouth West Africa case (Liberia v South Africa) (Preliminary Objections) ICJ Reports 1962, p.319\nLegal Consequences of the Separation of the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius in 1965, Advisory Opinion, ICJ Rep 2019, p. 95\nSerious breaches of peremptory norms and ICJ’s jurisdiction-rights of third states\n\nEast Timor case (Portugal v.

Myanmar)\n\nCourt:\n\nInternational Court of Justice (ICJ)\n\n\nParties:\n\nRepublic of The Gambia (Applicant) v. Republic of the Union of Myanmar (Respondent)\n\n\nProcedural History:\n\nThe Gambia filed an application on 11 November 2019, alleging Myanmar violated the Genocide Convention.\nThe case included a request for provisional measures, granted in January 2020.\nMyanmar raised objections to the jurisdiction and admissibility, which were dismissed in a judgment on 22 July 2022.\nIn 2023, the Maldives and several other states filed declarations of intervention.\n\n\nFacts:\n\nThe Gambia accused Myanmar of committing genocide against the Rohingya, violating the 1948 Genocide Convention.\nVarious states sought to intervene under Article 63 of the ICJ Statute, seeking to influence the interpretation of the Convention.\n\n\nLegal Issue:\n\nWhether the intervention declarations filed by the Maldives and a group of other states met the requirements under Article 63 and whether their scope adhered to the limits of convention interpretation.\n\n\nDecision:\n\nThe Court admitted the interventions by the Maldives and the joint group of states, but only in relation to the interpretation of the Genocide Convention.\n\n\nRatio Decidendi:\n\nArticle 63 grants states the right to intervene in cases involving the construction of a convention to which they are parties, without needing to show a specific legal interest beyond their membership.\nThe ICJ determined that the declarations conformed to this, focusing on the interpretation of the convention’s relevant articles.\n\n\nSignificance:\n\nThis case highlights the procedural role of third-party interventions under the ICJ Statute and reinforces the interpretation of states’ rights under international conventions, especially concerning genocidal acts.\n\n\n\n\nPart IX: The Law of Responsibility - Consequences of an Internationally Wrongful Act from James Crawford’s Commentary in Brownlie’s Principles of Public International Law\n\nCase Name:\n\nThe Law of Responsibility: Consequences of an Internationally Wrongful Act\n\n\nProcedural History:\n\nThis part of the commentary deals with the legal consequences and obligations that arise from internationally wrongful acts committed by states, as structured under the International Law Commission’s (ILC) Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA).\n\n\nOriginal Dispute:\n\nThe core issue here is how states are held accountable for breaches of international obligations and the types of reparations they are required to offer in response.\nThe analysis also includes the role of countermeasures in enforcing compliance with international law when cessation or reparation is not forthcoming.\n\n\nReason for Trial:\n\nThe purpose of the trial, or in this context the legal commentary, is to assess the types of legal consequences states face after committing wrongful acts. This includes the processes by which cessation, restitution, compensation, and satisfaction are invoked, as well as the rules for taking countermeasures against a state that refuses to rectify its wrongful actions.\n\n\nMaterial Facts:\n\n\nCessation def is an obligation that exists after a wrongful act to stop the breach and comply with international obligations moving forward.\nReparation is the broader obligation to repair the harm caused by the wrongful act, and it may take the form of:\n\nRestitution: restoring the situation to what it was before the wrongful act.\nCompensation: financial payment when restitution is not feasible.\nSatisfaction: addressing non-material damage, such as through apologies or trials.\n\n\nCountermeasures are defined as acts taken by an injured state when the responsible state fails to meet its obligations to cease or make reparations for the wrongful act.\n\nIssue Raised:\n\nThe main legal question is how state responsibility is invoked and enforced under international law, and how the various forms of reparation and countermeasures are properly implemented in practice.\nAdditionally, the commentary addresses the conditions for taking countermeasures, such as proportionality and legal limits, especially regarding serious breaches of peremptory norms (jus cogens).\n\n\nLaw(s)/Statute(s) in Contention:\n\nARSIWA (Articles on State Responsibility), focusing on:\n\nArticle 30 (Obligations of cessation).\nArticle 31 (Reparation in full for injuries caused by a wrongful act).\nArticle 35 (Restitution).\nArticle 36 (Compensation).\nArticle 37 (Satisfaction).\nArticle 22 and 49-54 (Countermeasures).\n\n\n\n\nPrecedents:\n\nFactory at Chorzów (Germany v. Poland):\n\nEstablished the principle of reparation, which requires a wrongful act to be fully remedied to restore the status quo ante.\n\n\nM/V Saiga (No 2):\n\nReaffirmed the principle that reparation must restore the injured state or party to the position it would have held had the breach not occurred.\n\n\nGabčíkovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary/Slovakia):\n\nDiscussed the proportionality of countermeasures and state responsibility for breach of international obligations.\n\n\n\n\nTests:\n\nThe proportionality test for countermeasures, ensuring that responses by injured states are proportional to the wrongful act.\nThe causation test for compensation, requiring that damages claimed must be directly linked to the wrongful act.\n\n\nWords and Phrases Considered:\n\nRestitution: Return to the pre-breach state, where possible.\nSatisfaction: Non-material remedies such as apologies or other symbolic actions.\nCountermeasures: Unlawful actions taken in response to an unlawful act, justified as a way to induce compliance with international obligations.\n\n\nArguments by Party:\n\nThe responsible state must first be called upon to cease the wrongful conduct and make reparations before countermeasures can be taken.\nThe injured state may invoke countermeasures only after these remedies have been sought and refused, and the measures must be proportionate.\n\n\nJudicial Opinions:\n\nThe International Court of Justice (ICJ) has consistently upheld that reparation should aim to fully restore the injured party to the position it would have occupied if the wrongful act had not occurred (Factory at Chorzów).\nRestitution remains the preferred form of reparation, though it may not always be possible or proportionate, leading to compensation as the next best option.\n\n\nLegal Reasoning:\n\nCrawford’s analysis emphasizes that cessation and reparation arise automatically upon the occurrence of a wrongful act, while countermeasures are a last resort, taken only after the responsible state fails to meet its secondary obligations. These principles reflect a balance between maintaining international peace and upholding legal order through the enforcement of responsibilities.\n\n\nRatio Decidendi:\n\nThe legal obligation to repair is essential in international law, aiming to restore the injured state to its prior status through cessation, restitution, or compensation. Countermeasures are allowed but heavily regulated to ensure that they do not exceed the harm caused or violate other peremptory norms of international law.\n\n\nResult:\n\nThe state found responsible for a wrongful act must immediately cease the violation and take steps to make full reparation, either through restitution, compensation, or satisfaction. In cases of severe breaches, such as violations of erga omnes norms, all states may have an interest in ensuring that the wrongful act is remedied.\n\n\nRelevance to Modern Law:\n\nCrawford’s commentary highlights the increasing importance of erga omnes obligations and jus cogens norms in the modern international legal system, stressing that states have an interest in upholding certain fundamental rights and obligations even when they are not directly injured. This has implications for global enforcement of human rights and state accountability for breaches of international law.\nThis detailed analysis provides insight into the functioning of state responsibility and the enforcement mechanisms available under international law, making it a foundational element for understanding modern international legal practice.\n\n\nThe Corfu Channel Case (United Kingdom v Albania) (Merits) [1949] ICJ Reports 4.\n\nCourt:\n\nInternational Court of Justice (ICJ)\n\n\nParties:\n\nUnited Kingdom v Albania\n\n\nProcedural History:\n\nThe case was brought before the ICJ after a series of incidents in the Corfu Channel, where British warships were damaged by mines.\n\n\nFacts:\n\nIn 1946, British naval ships suffered damage while passing through the Corfu Channel, located between Greece and Albania.\nThe United Kingdom accused Albania of laying mines in the channel without warning, thus causing damage to their ships.\n\n\nLegal Issue:\n\nWhether Albania was responsible for the explosion of the mines and if it had violated international law by not informing other states about the mines’ existence in its territorial waters.\n\n\nDecision:\n\nThe ICJ held that Albania was responsible for the damage to the British ships.\nIt found that Albania had knowledge of the minefield and failed to notify other states, constituting a breach of its international obligations.\n\n\nRatio Decidendi:\n\nThe court established that states have a duty to notify others about known dangers in their waters, and failing to do so may constitute an internationally wrongful act.\n\n\nSignificance:\n\nThis case reinforced the principles of state responsibility and the duty to notify other states of hazards in international navigation channels, laying groundwork for later international law developments on state responsibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 10: Use of Force\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\njus ad bellum-law on the use of force\n\njus in bello:  law on the way war is conducted (international humanitarian law)- military occupation\n\n\nUNILATERAL USE OF FORCE:  PROHIBITION ON THE USE OF FORCE\n\nArt 12-Covenant of the League of Nations\n\n“The Members of the League agree that, if there should arise between them any dispute likely to lead to a rupture they will submit the matter either to arbitration or judicial settlement or to enquiry by the Council, and they agree in no case to resort to war until three months after the award by the arbitrators or the judicial decision, or the report by the Council.

There will be time during tutorials to discuss and clarify your understanding of the answers.\n\nWhat are the recognised sources of international law? What is the authority for this?\n\nA Treaty is defined as:\n\nAn international agreement concluded between States in written form and governed by international law, whether embodied in a single instrument or in two or more related instruments and whatever its particular designation. (See Art. 2 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969 – VCLT)\n\n\n\n\nHow do we establish customary international law?

Peremptory norms def\n\nslavery, genocide, piracy, and acts of aggression or illegal use of force\n\n\n\n\nUN Charter\n\n\n\nWeek 2:Personality and Recognition in international Law\n\n\nWhy is legal personality important in international law?\n\nLegal personality is crucial in international law as it determines which entities, such as states and international organizations, can possess rights, obligations, and participate in the international legal system. It allows these entities to enter into treaties, bring claims before international courts, and be held accountable for their actions. Without legal personality, an entity cannot be recognized as a participant in international law or engage in legal processes.\n\n\n\nWhat are the indicia of statehood?\n\n4 main criteria:\n\n‘The state as a person of international law should possess the following qualifications:\n\n(a) a permanent population;\n(b) a defined territory;\n(c) government; and\n(d) capacity to enter into relations with other states.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the criteria for UN membership? Is UN membership an indicia of statehood?\n\nMembership in International Orgs – Art 4 UN Charter requires ‘peace loving state’ that accepts and carries out obligations under the charter.\nStates that act ‘lawfully’\nYes, UN membership is often considered an indicia of statehood, as it reflects recognition by the international community and the ability to engage in international relations.\n\n\n\nWhat is the significance of the principle of self-determination in contemporary international law?\n\nSelf-determination:\n\n‘All people have the right to self-determination; by virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development’ (Common Art 1 ICCPR 1966 &amp; ICESCR 1966)\nIt is a foundational principle that supports decolonization, the formation of new states, and the protection of minority groups.\nThis principle also influences international responses to conflicts and disputes where the rights of peoples to self-governance are at stake.\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides states, who or what has personality in international law?\n\nIndividuals\nMultinational corporations\nRegional organisations (African Union, EU)\nInsurgents or national liberation movements\n\n\n\nWhy is recognition significant in international law?\n\nConsidered important act that can affect a state’s ability to exercise its rights and responsibilities as a state\nnb there is a difference between recognition of states and recognition of governments.\n\n\n\nWhat are the two theories of recognition in public international law?\n\nThe Constitutive Theory\n\nRecognition has a ‘constitutive’ effect so that a state becomes an international legal person and a subject of IL only through recognition.’\n\n\nThe Declaratory Theory\n\nStates exist independent of recognition:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the legal effects of recognition?\n\n‘States have discovered that the granting or withholding of recognition can be used to further a national policy.\nStates have refused it as a mark of disapproval, as nearly all of them did to Manchukuo and they have granted it in order to establish the very independence of which recognition is supposed to be a mere acknowledgement.\nallowing it to participate in international relations, enter into treaties, and assert rights and obligations under international law. Recognition also affects the entity’s ability to access international courts and organizations, and it may influence the application of diplomatic immunities and privileges.\n\n\n\nAre there restrictions on the discretion to recognise a state?\n\nRecognition should generally align with established criteria for statehood, such as those outlined in the Montevideo Convention, which include a permanent population, defined territory, effective government, and capacity to enter into relations with other states.\nAdditionally, recognition should not violate fundamental international principles, such as the prohibition on recognizing entities that result from illegal use of force (e.g., in cases of unlawful territorial acquisition) or the principle of self-determination.\nCannot be revoked\n\n\n\nFor decades a bloody civil war raged in Reynes between Suddene (who speak Gaelic) and Westernesse (who speak Saxon). Westernessans had fought for independence from Reynes because of their persistent, extreme poverty which they attribute to the ongoing, systematic depletion of natural resources (water and natural gas) located in Westernesse by the Suddenen-dominated federal government. As part of a 2014 peace treaty to end the civil war, Westernesse and the central government of Reynes resolved that local parliamentary elections would be held in Westernesse in 2016 and a referendum in 2017 on the question of Westernessian independence, and Reynes would respect the results of these ballots. The ballots would be overseen by the regional organisation, the Highlands Union (HU). Reynes is a member state of HU. Following the 2016 elections, a predominantly Saxon-speaking Westernessian parliament was installed. Westernesse has since started to establish its own security forces under the supervision of HU. In October 2017, Westernesse held its independence referendum with 97% of the population voting to secede from Reynes. Over 50 States congratulated the people of Westernesse and formally stated that they would recognise Westernesse. Many of these states are actively pursuing treaty negotiations with Westernesse to secure trade and other international relationships as quickly as possible. Reynes’s Prime Minister Murry Horn wishes to notify the United Nations’ Security Council and HU that Reynes will respect the outcome of the referendum and recognise the new state provided that it cedes its northern region of Westernesse Minor to Reynes. He maintains that this is non-negotiable because Westernesse Minor’s people are predominantly Gaelic-speaking Suddenens. He has deployed Reynesian military forces to secure this territory and protect Suddenens from possible persecution by the new Saxon-dominated Westernessian government. 5 states in the region, including the regional power, Volkor, have indicated that the cession of Westernesse Minor to Reynes is a condition of their recognition of Westernesse.\n\n\nAdvise the Prime Minister whether Westernesse satisfies the criteria of statehood\n\nAnswer template:\n\nWhether W satisfied the criteria for statehood\n\nMontevideo criteria\n\nPopulation\n\nArt 1(a) - permanent population\n\nDuchy of Sealand - no minimum size, but a state community playing a role in vital human needs (eg hospitals education etc)\n\n\nReasonable stability (Western Sahara Ad Op)\n\n\nGovernment\n\nMontevideo Art 1(c) - effective\nParliament elected\nUnknown control but reasonable assumption, Yugoslavia and Somalia - explicit lack of control over territory\nBadinter Commission - regional custom\n\nThe government is not identified as either representative or nonrepresentative of the people\n\n\n–‘effective’ see eg Aaland Islands Case or French Indemnity of 1831\nWhat is the role of other rentities in ‘propping up’ the gov?

To the east of Paxman is the state of Conti, a multi-ethnic state that has a long history of peaceful co-existence and democracy. This has included providing relative political and social autonomy to certain ethnic groups such as the Zielke people, who reside in the western region of Conti near the border of Paxman. In 2023, a popularist leader was elected as the President of Conti on a platform of centralisation and ‘national cohesion’. Upon assuming office, the President began demonising the Zielke people as separatists whose physical presence and political autonomy ‘threatens the national integrity of Conti’. As a result, Conti national security officers and police commenced a campaign targeting the Zielke people as a collective group, including subjecting some prominent Zielke leaders to imprisonment and torture in Conti prisons. Seeking to escape the persecution, several thousand Zielke people fled across the border to seek asylum in Paxman. Paxman has signed but not ratified the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees, and is not a state party to the 1967 Optional Protocol. Instead, Paxman has requested that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) undertake refugee status determination in its territory with respect to the Zielke people. Overwhelmingly, the UNHCR has found the Zielke people to be refugees within the meaning of the 1951 Convention.\n\nThe 1951 Convention places certain obligations on state parties including to provide housing to refugees and not to return a refugee to a place of persecution (the obligation of non-refoulement). Paxman has refused to offer any form of assistance to the Conti refugees, and in 2016, even began deporting some refugees back to Conti. At the peak of the refugee crisis, the UN Security Council (‘UNSC’) passed a resolution that called on Paxman to provide ‘shelter and safety’ to the Zielke refugees within its territory and recognised the obligation of non-refoulement as a ‘foundational norm’ of international law. During the parallel UN General Assembly (UNGA) debates, several states in the Asia Pacific region noted that they have long had a practice of providing shelter to refugees in their territories, despite not being signatories to the Refugees Convention.\n\nThe Australian Prime Minister wishes to make a statement in parliament on the situation.  Assume Australia has ratified the 1951 Convention but has not passed enabling legislation in its domestic law.\n\n\n\nAdvise the Prime Minister on the legality of Paxman’s actions in relation to the expulsion of Zielke refugees from its territory and the denial of housing to Zielke refugees residing in Paxman.\nAdvise the Prime Minister of Australia’s international obligations to the Zielke refugees, if any.

There will be time during tutorials to test and clarify your understanding of the answers.\r\nQuestions\n\nWhat is meant by foreign state immunity? When can foreign state immunity be claimed before Australian courts?\n\nState Immunity\n\nConcept of Immunity is underpinned by the principles of State Sovereignty, reciprocity and State equality (par in parem non habet imperium – an equal does not have power over an equal).\nConcept of Immunity has developed with time and there has been a move from the traditional Absolute Immunity approach (where the State enjoyed complete immunity from domestic legal action) to a so called Restrictive Immunity approach (where the State only enjoys immunity under certain circumstances).\n\n\n\n\nWhen is a head of state immune from the jurisdiction of another state?\n\nImmunity of Head of State/ former Head of State\n\nR v Bow Street Metropolitan Magistrate Ex P Pinochet [2000] 1 A.C. 147\n\nIn summary court held a former head of state has limited functional immunity (ratione materiae)- torture is not a state function therefore no immunity\n\n\nBy signing the Rome Statute, state parties have waived immunities to their heads of states or other state officials.\n\n\n\n\nWhen is a foreign minister or other government official immune from the jurisdiction of another state?\n\nHead of State and Government Officials:\n\nAbsolute Immunity: Heads of state, heads of government, and foreign ministers typically enjoy absolute immunity from the jurisdiction of foreign courts while they are in office. This immunity covers all acts, both official and private, and is not subject to exceptions, even for alleged violations of international law.\nInternational Customary Law: This immunity is recognized under customary international law and is grounded in the need to protect the sovereignty and effective governance of states.\n\n\nActs Performed in an Official Capacity:\n\nFunctional Immunity (Immunity Ratione Materiae): After leaving office, former officials (including foreign ministers) retain immunity for acts performed in their official capacity. This type of immunity, known as “functional immunity,” protects them from legal actions related to their official acts while in office, as these acts are considered acts of the state itself.\nPersonal Immunity (Immunity Ratione Personae): While in office, these officials also enjoy “personal immunity,” which is broader and covers all acts, official or personal. This immunity ceases when they leave office, except for the continued protection of official acts under functional immunity.\n\n\n\n\nWhat immunity does a diplomatic agent enjoy from criminal jurisdiction of the receiving state? What other immunities does a diplomatic agent enjoy?\n\nDiplomatic and consular immunity\n\nDiplomats are immune from all administrative, civil, criminal jurisdiction of the receiving State, to which they are accredited.\nGenerally, a Diplomats family will also enjoy the same immunities (provided they are not a citizen of the host State)\nDiplomats are unable to do their jobs/role without fear or favour. Concept is based on so-called ‘functional necessity’ theory.\nThe criteria for diplomatic status are set out in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 1961 (‘Vienna Convention’).\nThe Vienna Convention has been made part of Australian domestic law pursuant to the Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities Act 1967 (Cth)\n\n\nImmunity of Foreign Minister\n\nDemocratic Republic of Congo v Belgium (The Arrest Warrant Case) I.C.J. Rep 2002, p3\n\nBelgium issued international arrest warrant against Congo’s Foreign Minister Ndombasi for crimes considered to be grave breaches of International Humanitarian Law (Geneva Conventions &amp; Protocols)\nBelgium claimed that it could exercise Universal Jurisdiction.\nCongo argued that it was a violation of principle that a State cannot exercise authority on territory of another State and that it was also a violation of the principle of sovereign equality between States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen can a diplomatic mission or the private residence of a diplomatic agent by entered or raided by officials of a receiving state such as police?\n\nArticle 22 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations:\n\nInviolability: The premises of a diplomatic mission (e.g., an embassy or consulate) are inviolable. This means that agents of the receiving state, including police or other officials, are prohibited from entering the premises without the express consent of the head of the mission.\nProtection Obligation: The receiving state has a special duty to protect the mission’s premises against intrusion, damage, disturbance, and to ensure that the mission can function effectively.\nNo Entry Without Consent: Even in cases of emergency, such as during a fire or security threat, the receiving state must first obtain the consent of the head of the mission before entering the premises. This strict protection underscores the principle of inviolability and the sovereignty that the mission enjoys within the host state.\n\n\nPrivate Residence of a Diplomatic Agent:\n\nArticle 30 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations:\nInviolability: The private residence of a diplomatic agent enjoys the same inviolability and protection as the premises of the mission. This means that the residence cannot be entered or searched by the receiving state’s officials, including police, without the explicit consent of the diplomatic agent.\nProtection of Family Members: The inviolability extends not just to the diplomatic agent but also to their family members who live in the reside\n\n\n\n\nAre there any circumstances when the immunity of a diplomatic agent can be waived? If so when and by who?\n\nConsent of the Diplomatic Agent or Mission:\n\nExpress Consent: The only scenario in which the receiving state’s officials can lawfully enter the diplomatic mission or the private residence of a diplomatic agent is if they have obtained the express consent of the head of the mission (for the embassy or consulate) or the diplomatic agent (for their residence). This consent must be clear and unambiguous.\nPractical Considerations: In practice, such consent might be granted in situations where the diplomatic mission or residence is under direct threat (e.g., a fire or an immediate security risk) and the head of the mission or diplomatic agent agrees that entry is necessary to protect lives or property.\n\n\nWaiver of Immunity:\n\nWaiver by the Sending State: The sending state (the state that the diplomat represents) can waive the inviolability of the mission premises or the diplomatic agent’s residence. This waiver must be explicit and is usually done in writing. Waivers are rare because they undermine the protections that diplomatic missions and agents enjoy under international law.\nNo Implied Waiver: Simply permitting a police officer or official to enter the premises in one instance does not constitute a general waiver of immunity or inviolability. Each instance requires separate consent.\r\nProblem Question\n\n\n\n\nProblem scenario\nThe foreign minister of Istok, Bled Brod, is visiting Zealand as part of a trade mission to finalise a bilateral free trade agreement between the two countries. During her visit she is staying in the Istokian ambassador’s residence which is located on the grounds of the embassy compound. The visit is considered a major step forward by Zealand in relations between the two countries. For nearly a decade there was very limited engagement between the two states after the hijacking of an Air Zealand passenger plane at Istok’s major airport and the murder of 176 passengers of whom 54 were Zealand citizens by the hijackers in 2008. Following this tragedy, Istok refused to allow Zealander officials to enter Istokian territory to investigate the incident despite Zealand’s persistent requests.\nZealand’s Defence Department has now acquired credible information that Foreign Minister Brod was one of the hijackers involved in the murder of its nationals. These acts occurred prior to her appointment as foreign minister. As a result of this information, the Attorney-General has obtained a warrant for the arrest of Foreign Minister Brod and intends to arrest her while she is visiting Zealand.\nTo do this, Zealand police will need to enter the Istokian embassy to gain custody of the foreign minister.\nAdvise the Attorney-General of Zealand regarding:\n\n\na)    whether Bled Brod has immunity from criminal jurisdiction; and\n\nBB will enjoy immunity b/c a serving foreign min enjoys absolute immunity (arrest warrant). Ratione Persone: The acts before office as well as during office. This protects the nature of job.\n\nSee Pinochet after leaving office you only have Raitione materiae, only covers official functions.\n\n\nICC Art 27(2) - Rome Statute immunities shall not bar the court from exercising jurisdiction.

What is a declaration? How do we determine whether a reservation is compatible with a treaty?\n\n\nArticle 2(1)(d)\n\n‘Reservation’ means a unilateral statement, however phrased or named, made by a State, when signing, ratifying, accepting, approving or acceding to a treaty, whereby it purports to exclude or to modify the legal effect of certain provisions of the treaty in their application to that State”\n\n\n‘Interpretative declaration def’ means a unilateral statement, however phrased or named, made by a State or an international organization, whereby that State or that organization purports to specify or clarify the meaning or scope of a treaty or of certain of its provisions.”\n\n\nWhat is the obligation of a signatory state prior to the entry into force of the treaty?\n\n\nObligation created should be governed by international law.  cf a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) which does not necessarily contain an intention to create legal obligations under international law.\n. When the parties to the later treaty do not include all the parties to the earlier one:\n\n(a) as between States parties to both treaties the same rule applies as in paragraph 3; (b) as between a State party to both treaties and a State party to only one of the treaties, the treaty to which both States are parties governs their mutual rights and obligations.\n\n\n\n\nTOCAS - Tutorial\n\nR of Botox\nSonor = sepia\nTonka = teal\nAris = apple green\n\nWeek 7: Law of Treaties (II)\nQuestions:\n\nWhat are the rules in respect of treaty interpretation?

People from the region and beyond, however, have continued to seek out Aris as a major migration destination.  Accordingly, Aris last year began construction of a wall to control unauthorised access to its territory.  The wall stretches along the border between Aris and Sunor, and continues eastwards along the border between Aris and Tonka.  In order to stop people crossing into Aris at the ‘Goldian Gap’, (where Aris, Tonka and Sunor share a border) Aris has entered into a bilateral agreement with Sunor to extend the wall along the border between Tonka and Sunor.  During the building of the wall, Aris redirects its patrols so that they are solely patrolling its own borders, rather than the borders of all States Parties to the TOCAS.\r\nTonka and the Republic of Botox meet to respond to Aris’ actions.  The Republic of Botox proposes that it will withdraw from common and joint patrols of the region.  Both Tonka and the Republic of Botox also cease providing intelligence and data under the treaty.  Tonka then announces a six month freeze on cooperating with Sunor at the Tonka/Sunor border.  The result will be that Sunor’s strict drug laws will not be respected at the border.\r\nWith reference to:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe negotiated treaty text (of the week of Sept 9th)\nThe background to the treaty (Canvas, Treaties I)\nThe Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties and cases / state practice interpreting it\nOther applicable sources of law\r\nConsider the legal implications of the States’ Parties to the TOCAS’ actions, and any implications under the law of treaties for the States’ Parties.\nAris - Botox position\n\nArt 62\n\n(1)(a)-(1)(b)\n(2)(b)\n\n\nArt 60\nArt 31(1)\nAris have violated the terms of the treaty\n\nPreamble ‘cooperation’\nArt 8 ‘patrols’ of the contracting parties (should take together)\n\n\n\n\nTonka / Botox\n\nBy stopping patrols\nArt 60(3)(b) a material breach = abreach of a provision essential to the objejct and purpose\nIn a multilateral treaty 60(2)(a) in whole or part terminate or suspend between T and Aris or between T and everyone\nDanube Dams case\nT’s actions not to share intelligence and freeze cooperation at the T/S border, these are not material breaches bc we’ve taken the option to suspend which means we aren’t obliged to do those things\nCustomary International Law - was never a basis in custom (no opinio juris - Rights of Passage) - treaty displaced the custom\nCan treaty displace custom/treaty\n\n\nSunor\n\nAris actions are a material breach - not through the bilateral agreement but their decision to stop the patrols (object and purpose)\nTonka’s suspension of border cooperation cannot be suspended under the treaty because of its existence in custom\n\nThe Nicaragua case says custom and treaty can coexist on the same point at the same time.\n\n\n\n\nAris\n\nAris’ actions are not a breach of the treaty - we are just cooperating, redirecting our patrols still fits within the definition of patrol activities, according to the preamble are and art 10, and 8, this is proportionate patrols / contributions in action\nThis is a temporary suspension (Art 60)\nArt 62(1) - not a fundamental, reasonably foreseeable change\nBecause we have not engaged in a material breach, then the actions by other states are material breaches\nThe bilateral agreement with Sunor is legitimate and does not impact the treaty.

One of the states that Monkravia has diplomatic relations with is the state of Bontland.\r\nBoth Bontland and Monkravia are parties to a treaty known as the Lunga Accord which entered into force for both States on 1 January 2018. The Lunga Accord provides for an exchange of military personnel. Under the Lunga Accord members of the Monkravian military can be sent for training in principles of democratic governance at the Bontland Military Academy\r\nThe Lunga Accord set out several provisions relating to how these military exchanges would occur. Article 7(1) of the Lunga Accord provides:\r\n“The authorities of Monkravia shall have exclusive jurisdiction over members of the Monkravia military on exchange under this accord and any accompanying civilian dependants accompanying them with respect to all offences committed within Bontland and otherwise punishable by the law of Bontland excepting for an offence relating to the security of Bontland. Bontland retains exclusive jurisdiction in relation to all offences relating to the security of Bontland that may be committed by Monkravia military personnel on exchange under this Accord.”\r\nArticle 7(2) of the Lunga Accord then goes on to provide:\r\n“an offence relating to the security of a State shall include:\r\n(i) treason against the State;\r\n(ii) sabotage, espionage or violation of any law relating to official secrets of that State, or secrets relating to the national defence of that State.\r\nArticle 7(3) of the Lunga Accord further clarifies\r\n“The foregoing provisions of this Article shall not confer on the military authorities of  Monkravia any right to exercise jurisdiction over persons who are nationals of or ordinarily resident in Bontland unless they are members of the Monkravia military forces.\r\nArticle 8 of the Lunga Accord also provides:\n\nThe military authorities of Monkravia and the authorities of Bontland shall assist each other in accordance with arrangements to be agreed to by them in the arrest of members of the Monkravia military or their dependants in Bontland and in handing them over to the authority which is to exercise jurisdiction in accordance with the above provisions.\nThe authorities of Bontland shall notify promptly the military authorities of Monkravia of the arrest of any member of the Monkravia military or their dependants.\r\nIn 2021 Bontland enacted the Status of Forces Implementation Act (hereinafter the SFIA). The effect of the SFIA was to transpose the provisions of the Lunga Accord into Bontlands domestic law. A copy of the Lunga Accord was annexed to the SFIA and section 17(b) of the SFIA provided “The Lunga Accord shall have force of Law in Bontland.”\r\nFor a number of years the Lunga Accord was implemented by both states without incident. However, in March 2024 Colonel Mongus Drinkongo was sent on exchange to Bontland and began attending the Bontland Military Academy. Colonel Drinkongo is the second eldest son of the President of Monkravia and is widely expected to succeed his father as President of Monkravia one day. Three weeks after arriving in Bontland Colonel Drinkongo murdered another soldier who made derogatory comments about his father. The dead soldier was the son of a well-respected political journalist from Bontland.\r\nColonel Drinkongo has been arrested by Bontland Police. Upon his arrest, Colonel Drinkongo appeared in a closed session of the Central Bontland Magistrates court and inter alia invoked his immunity from jurisdiction for the alleged crime pursuant to the Lunga Accord. Before the magistrate presiding and on a subsequent appeal to the Bontland Supreme Court his claim to immunity was rejected and his trial on the charge of murder has been set down for 4 December 2024. The Bontland police did not notify Monkravia of Colonel Drinkongos arrest. Monkravia only became aware of his arrest due to media reporting of the appeal to the Bontland Supreme Court.\r\nOutraged by his sons detention President Drinkongo has demanded his son be immediately released. As part of a multi-pronged diplomatic initiative to resolve this crisis Monkravia has commenced proceedings before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) alleging that Bontland is in contravention of its obligations under international law.\r\nYou work as an intern at the ICJ. One of the ICJ judges has asked you to assist her to prepare for the upcoming hearing of the case. Please prepare a memorandum of advice to the judge focussing on issues of State responsibility. In particular, the judge has asked you to highlight in your advice:\nWhat are the primary obligations of Bontland?\n\nAll offences except for offences relating to security of Bontland are to under exclusive jurisdiction of Monkravia\nThe authorities of Bontland are required to notify military authorities of any arrest\nBontland and Monkravia will issue joint operation for arrest\n\n\nHas Bontland committed any internationally wrongful act(s)? If so explain how.\n\nYes, violated treaty obligations as apply to Colonel Drinkongo, as murder is not a crime of state security per the treaty (Art 8 of Lunga, Art 4 of VLT)\nBontland did not jointly arrest Colonel, did not notify Monkravia, held multiple trials without jurisdiction\n\n\nCan any internationally wrongful act be attributed to Bontland? If so explain how?\r\nAssume that all States are members of the United Nations and all States have been parties to the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) since its entry into force in 1980.

48).\nAn application must be accompanied by a Community Impact Statement (CIS), with regulations specifying the requirements, content, consultation processes, and other relevant aspects related to community impact statements (Section 48).\nSection 49 outlines the general provisions for Extended trading authorization (ETA) applications, including relevant hours and the nature of the application. ETAs must not cause frequent undue disturbance to the peace and order of the neighborhood (Section 49).\nThe Liquor Act 2007 details the application criteria for compliance, which includes fee, additional information, advertisement, and compliance with additional requirements (Section 53).\nThe Liquor Regulation 2018 defines neighboring premises, notification requirements of neighbors, and categorizes the CIS application as category B, which also includes matters related to gambling activities (Sections 20, 21, 27, and 28).\nSection 29 presents consultation requirements, listing out required stakeholders for consultation, including the Ministry of Health, the Department of Communities and Justice, Transport for NSW, local Aboriginal community leaders, and other specified stakeholders.\nSection 51(1)(a) of the legislation states that this section applies to different types of authorizations that can be granted by the Authority, including an extended trading authorization.\nSection 51(2) elaborates on the requirements for applying for an authorization. The application must be in a form and manner approved by the Authority, be accompanied by the prescribed fee and the necessary information, must be advertised if required by regulations, and must comply with other requirements as approved by the Authority or as prescribed by regulations.\nSection 51(7) indicates that the regulations may prescribe a fee for the granting of an authorization. The authorization does not take effect until the fee, if prescribed or determined, has been paid.\n\n\nexplain what issues are raised - together with legal elements 800 wordsish\nFit and Proper Person Requirement: The applicant, Gia Gambina, must demonstrate good character, honesty, integrity, and competency to carry on the business. This requirement ensures that the licensee is suitable to operate a licensed premise.\nImpact on Various Sectors: The Authority must consider the impact of the application on sectors such as the live music industry, arts, tourism, and the community or cultural sector. This assessment ensures that the application aligns with the broader interests and development of the community.\n\nCommunity Impact Statement (CIS): The application must be accompanied by a CIS, which outlines the potential impact on the local community. The CIS should address concerns related to the extended operating hours, increased gambling opportunities, and any other relevant issues raised by the community.\nConsultation and Local Community Views: The Authority is required to consider the views and concerns of the local community when assessing the application. This includes consultation with stakeholders such as the Ministry of Health, the Department of Communities and Justice, Transport for NSW, local Aboriginal community leaders, and other specified stakeholders.\n\n\nCompliance and Additional Requirements: The application must meet the criteria for compliance, including the payment of fees, submission of additional information, and advertisement of the application. The Authority may impose restrictions or additional requirements before granting the license.\nDisturbance to the Neighborhood: The extended trading authorization (ETA) application must not cause frequent undue disturbance to the peace and order of the neighborhood. This criterion ensures that the extended hours do not negatively impact the local community’s peace and well-being.\nGambling Activities: The application involves an increase in the number of gaming machines, which falls under the category of gambling activities. The regulations under the Liquor Act 2007 and Liquor Regulation 2018 outline specific requirements and considerations for applications related to gambling activities.\nFee Payment: The authorization does not take effect until the prescribed fee, if any, has been paid. This ensures that the necessary financial obligations are met before the authorization is granted.\nInterpret the legislative provisions - 400 wordsish\n\ninterpretation legislation, general principles of interpretation, judicial or quasi-judicial decisions, and extrinsic sources.\nLiteral Rule and Purposive Approach: The provisions of the Liquor Act 2007 and Liquor Regulation 2018 should be interpreted based on their plain and ordinary meaning (literal rule) while considering the purpose and intention of the legislation (purposive approach). This includes understanding the requirements for license applications, the conditions for granting licenses, and the impact on various sectors mentioned in Section 45(7).\nContextual Interpretation: The provisions should be interpreted in the context of the overall legislative framework governing the extension of hotel trading hours in New South Wales. This requires considering Sections 40-43 as the generic provisions for license applications and Section 48 as the specific provision for community impact statements.\nPrecedents and Judicial Decisions: Relevant court or quasi-judicial decisions related to license applications, community impact statements, and extended trading authorizations should be considered to understand the interpretation and application of the provisions in similar cases. These decisions may provide guidance on factors to be considered, requirements for community impact statements, and the imposition of restrictions on granting licenses.\nExtrinsic Sources: Extrinsic sources, such as legislative history, reports, explanatory memoranda, and parliamentary debates, may provide additional insight into the legislative intent and assist in interpreting the provisions. These sources can provide background information, policy considerations, and the rationale behind the legislation.\nInterpretation Legislation: Any specific interpretation acts or legislation applicable in the jurisdiction should be consulted to understand any specific rules or principles of interpretation that may apply to the Liquor Act 2007 and Liquor Regulation 2018.\nlocal consent authority, in relation to licensed premises or proposed licensed premises, means—\n(a)  the local council in whose area (within the meaning of the Local Government Act 1993) the premises are, or will be, situated, or\n(b)  if consent to the carrying out of development on the land concerned is required from a person or body other than the council—that person or body.\n\n\n\nProvide a clear conclusion in your advice to the Authority on each legal issue that arises on the facts. - 250 words\n\n\n\nPart C: 350 words\n\nThe Principal Lawyer supervising your work has noticed that that the Authority’s file on this area of law is out of date.\nShe asks you to update it by following the instructions below:\n\n\nList FOUR sources that would directly assist in understanding the laws regarding liquor licences in NSW and be relevant to the specific advice you have given above.\n\nThe four sources must be selected from the following categories, with no more than one source from each of these six categories:\n\njournal article\nbook or edited book\nchapter in edited book\ninstitutional research report\ngovernment guide or information sheet\nJudicial or tribunal decision.\n\n\nJournal\n\nAGIS Plus Text\nHein Online\nThe Australian and New Zealand Journal of Criminology\nThe first source derives from the journal “Problematic Licensed Premises for Assault in Inner Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong,” a journal article in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Criminology. This text posits that a small minority of licensed premises appear to be the most problematic for alcohol-related violence, specifically those in large CBDs such as Sydney, Wollongong, and Newcastle. This resource examines the effects of restricting or expanding trading hours on rates of alcohol-related problems; it focuses on the small minority of 6% of licensed premises accounting for two-thirds of all on-premises assaults. This book can be found using the AGIS Plus Text (Informit) tool and applying the keywords ‘NSW hotel Extended trading hours.’\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter in edited book\n\nThe following source was from the book “Stemming the Tide of Alcohol,” a novel in conjunction with the Canberra Foundation for Alcohol Research and Education. Chapter 14, “Limits on trading hours, particularly late-night trading,” provides relevant insights into the history, regulations, and impact of trading hours in the context of liquor licensing. This resource examines the effects of restricting or expanding trading hours on rates of alcohol-related problems; it focuses on the emergence of late-night trading and its potential to reduce alcohol-related harm. This book can be found using the Google Scholars tool and applying the keywords ‘extended trading hours NSW.’\n\n\nCase - find a better case\n\nSecheny v Blacktown City Council [2009] NSWLEC 1361\nAn additional resource to consider is Secheny v Blacktown City Council [2009], a case with similar objectors, although these objectors expressed even greater disapproval than this situation. In this situation, the judge found that management’s preventative measures justified a trial period of extended hours to assess patron response and monitor potential issues, an idea applicable to this situation. This case was discovered using the keywords ‘NSW applying for “hotel Extended trading hours”’ on Lexis Advance Research, chosen for the relevance to this case and the recency.\n\n\nInstitution report\n\nThe final source, found in Google Scholar with the additional terms “authority gaming liquor laws,” is an e-brief by the authoritative NSW Parliamentary Research Service titled “Liquor licensing restrictions to address alcohol-related violence in NSW: 2008 to 2014.” This brief outlines the major licensing restrictions introduced since 2008 while referring to studies conducted on the effectiveness of certain limits, and examining trends in alcohol-related assaults.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a few sentences, justify why you selected each source as authoritative and useful to your advice work, and document your research strategy (i.e., what specific databases and search terms did you use to identify the relevant sources).\n\n\nIt is not sufficient to list sources that merely have a general connection with the topics of liquor licencing or gaming — they must be relevant to the factual situation given, and you must clearly explain the nature of that connection\n\n\n\n\n\nIssues Raised in the Given Facts (300 words)\r\nA.

The defendant is not required to establish that the person received or understood the warning or was capable of receiving or understanding the warning.\r\n- (4) A risk warning can be given orally or in writing (including by means of a sign or otherwise).\r\n- (5) A risk warning need not be specific to the particular risk and can be a general warning of risks that include the particular risk concerned (so long as the risk warning warns of the general nature of the particular risk).\r\n- (6) A defendant is not entitled to rely on a risk warning unless it is given by or on behalf of the defendant or by or on behalf of the occupier of the place where the recreational activity is engaged in.\r\n- (7) A defendant is not entitled to rely on a risk warning if it is established (on the balance of probabilities) that the harm concerned resulted from a contravention of a provision of a written law of the State or Commonwealth that establishes specific practices or procedures for the protection of personal safety.\r\n- (8) A defendant is not entitled to rely on a risk warning to a person to the extent that the warning was contradicted by any representation as to risk made by or on behalf of the defendant to the person.\r\n- (9) A defendant is not entitled to rely on a risk warning if the plaintiff was required to engage in the recreational activity by the defendant.\r\n- (10) The fact that a risk is the subject of a risk warning does not of itself mean—\r\n- (a) that the risk is not an obvious or inherent risk of an activity, or\r\n- (b) that a person who gives the risk warning owes a duty of care to a person who engages in an activity to take precautions to avoid the risk of harm from the activity.\r\n- Obvious risk\r\n- s 5F\r\n- Obvious Risk\r\n- (1) For the purposes of this Division, an obvious risk to a person who suffers harm is a risk that, in the circumstances, would have been obvious to a reasonable person in the position of that person.\r\n- (2) Obvious risks include risks that are patent or a matter of common knowledge.\r\n- (3) A risk of something occurring can be an obvious risk even though it has a low probability of occurring.\r\n- (4) A risk can be an obvious risk even if the risk (or a condition or circumstance that gives rise to the risk) is not prominent, conspicuous or physically observable.\r\n- s 5G\r\n- Injured persons presumed to be aware of obvious risks\r\n- (1) In proceedings relating to liability for negligence, a person who suffers harm is presumed to have been aware of the risk of harm if it was an obvious risk, unless the person proves on the balance of probabilities that he or she was not aware of the risk.\r\n- (2) For the purposes of this section, a person is aware of a risk if the person is aware of the type or kind of risk, even if the person is not aware of the precise nature, extent or manner of occurrence of the risk.\r\n- s 5H\r\n-  No proactive duty to warn of obvious risk\r\n- (1) A person (the defendant) does not owe a duty of care to another person (the plaintiff) to warn of an obvious risk to the plaintiff.\r\n- (2) This section does not apply if—\r\n- (a) the plaintiff has requested advice or information about the risk from the defendant, or\r\n- (b) the defendant is required by a written law to warn the plaintiff of the risk, or\r\n- (c) the defendant is a professional and the risk is a risk of the death of or personal injury to the plaintiff from the provision of a professional service by the defendant.\r\n- (3) Subsection (2) does not give rise to a presumption of a duty to warn of a risk in the circumstances referred to in that subsection.\r\n- risk was held to be obvious and accordingly, [defendant] did not owe a duty to warn of it pursuant\r\n- Inherent risk\r\n- s 5I\r\n- No liability for materialisation of inherent risk\r\n- (1) A person is not liable in negligence for harm suffered by another person as a result of the materialisation of an inherent risk.\r\n- (2) An inherent risk is a risk of something occurring that cannot be avoided by the exercise of reasonable care and skill.\r\n- (3) This section does not operate to exclude liability in connection with a duty to warn of a risk.\r\n-  ‘inherent risk’ is defined as ‘a risk of something occurring that cannot be avoided by the exercise of reasonable care and skill\r\n- Applies to any inherent ris\n\n\nIndicia of DUTY to avoid Pure Economic Loss (PEL) from Perre\n\nReasonable foreseeability of loss\nAvoid indeterminate liability\nAllow autonomy to pursue legitimate business interests\nVulnerability of plaintiff\nKnowledge &amp;

Moreover, the injuries weren’t because of the materialization of an obvious risk. The appeal was granted in favor of Ms. Tapp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 6: Nuisance\n\nNuisance\n\nprivate nuisance\n\nwhich is a tort, and\n\n\npublic nuisance\n\nwhich affects the ‘public at large’.\n\n\nThe tort of nuisance involves the unreasonable interference by the defendant with the plaintiff’s use or enjoyment of real property.\n\nHalsey v Esso Petroleum Co Ltd [1961] 1 WLR 68\nIt is different from trespass to land in that\n\n(a) it involves an interference with rights or enjoyment rather than a contact with the land and\n(b) it need not be a ‘direct’ or physical interference.\n\n\n\n\nNuisance examples\n\nNoise,\noffensive smells and flies,\nair pollution,\nthe presence of a brothel near residences,\nexcavation causing subsidence of land,\noverflow of water,\nallowing fire to spread to neighbouring property,\ndamage by tree roots,\ngolf balls landing in property near a golf course,\nand picketing\n\n\nThe common law imposes a duty of care on owners or occupiers of neighbouring properties to take reasonable care to avoid property damage to their neighbours:\n\nRobson v Leischke (2008) 72 NSWLR 98, 120 [96]\n\n\nThe High Court of Australia held in Brodie v Singleton Shire Council (2001) 206 CLR 512 that nuisance liability has been subsumed by the law of negligence and that the only remedy in such a case will be in negligence\n\n\nPrivate Nuisance\n\nIs nuisance actionable per se?\n\nthat actual damage encompasses not only physical damage but also annoyance, inconvenience, discomfort or interference with property right\n\n\nTitle to sue\n\na plaintiff will have to prove possession of land pursuant to some legal or equitable interest in the land in order to have standing to sue.\nLicensee typically cannot sue in nuisance, family members potentially can as they are licensees\nHunter v Canary Wharf Ltd [1997] AC 655,\n\nin which it held that there could be no standing to sue in nuisance unless the plaintiff could establish a ‘right to exclusive possession of the land, such as a freeholder or tenant in possession, or even a licensee with exclusive possession’ (per Lord Goff of Chieveley)\n\n\nUnprotected rights\n\nVictoria Park Racing and Recreation Grounds Co Ltd v Taylor (1937) 58 CLR 47\n\nthe plaintiff complained that the defendant had caused it economic loss by diminishing the number of persons who attended race meetings at the plaintiff’s race course.\n\nSet up a platform to watch and radio the game\nlaw of nuisance will protect only certain rights associated with the use and enjoyment of property\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRobson v Leischke (2008) 72 NSWLR 98\n\nThree kinds of interference are recognised by the law as constituting a nuisance:\n\n(a) causing encroachment on the neighbour’s land, short of trespass;\n(b) causing physical damage to the neighbour’s land or any building, works or vegetation on it; and\n(c) unduly interfering with a neighbour in the comfortable and convenient enjoyment of his or her land.

that failure had deprived the plaintiff of a 40% chance of avoiding the decline which she suffered following the seizure which contributed 25% to her total disability.\nNew South Wales Court of Appeal74 upheld the appeal of the defendant, concluding that the defendant’s negligence was not a cause of the plaintiff’s loss.\n\nThe High Court held that the plaintiff was not entitled to

defendant\nemployer-employee duty of care\nIn that case, the plaintiff’s evidence established that the defendant employer had failed properly to institute and maintain a safe system of work.\n\nThe defendant employer knew that the plaintiff and other workers, who were garbage collectors, routinely ran back and forth across busy roads emptying garbage bins from one side of the road into a truck being driven along the opposite side of the road\n\n\nDefendant claimed safe system would have made the employees’ shift longer and the defendant argued that, even if it had tried to implement such a system, the employees, including the plaintiff, would not have followed it.\n\nFailed bc no proof they wouldn’t follow\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFact and law: functions of judge and jury\n\nThe breach of duty issue (that is, whether the defendant was negligent) is a question of fact to be determined by the tribunal of fact according to the tests set down by law.\nThe determination of this question involves asking if the risk that brought about the breach was reasonably foreseeable and, then, the calculus of negligence must be applied to determine the reasonable response to the risk.\n\n\nThe ‘no evidence’ rule\n\nIf, however, there is any evidence at all, no matter how slight, which could reasonably support a finding against the defendant, the judge must allow the case to go to the jury.\nWhere the judge has decided that there is a prima facie case of negligence, or indeed any other tortious liability against a defendant, it is then open to the defendant to submit that there is ‘no case to answer’ and to seek a verdict by direction.\n\n\n12.3 The Standard of Proof\n\nCivil standard of proof\n\nSo in a negligence claim, the plaintiff having established a duty of care will also have to show that it is more likely than not that the defendant was negligent and that the negligence caused the plaintiff’s loss\n\n\nInferences\n\nWhere a plaintiff relies on circumstantial evidence and seeks to have the court draw an inference that the defendant was negligent, the evidence must give rise to a positive inference rather than allowing mere conjecture or a guess as to the facts\nHolloway v McFeeters (1956) 94 CLR 470\n\nwidow of a pedestrian who was killed at night in a ‘hit and run’ accident.\nShe sued the Nominal Defendant in respect of her husband’s death\n\nno direct evidence of the accident.\n\nThere were no witnesses, and the victim was deceased\n\n\ndeceased was guilty of 50% contributory negligence, having been on the roadway.\n\nOn appeal, the High Court (by a majority) held that the evidence supported an inference that more probably than not, the unidentified vehicle had been driven negligently\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWest v GIO of New South Wales (1981) 148 CLR 62\n\nplaintiff was injured in a collision between his car and another car, the driver of which was killed in the accident\n\nPlaintiff and wife both suffered loss of memory in respect of the accident\nplaintiff failed to prove that the collision had been caused by the negligence of the deceased driver of the other car because the evidence did not permit any inferences as to the conduct of either driver immediately before the collision\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12.5 Res Ipsa Loquitur\n\n“res ipsa loquitur’, which means ‘the thing itself speaks’, is an aid to a plaintiff in proving a prima facie case in some situations.\n\na method of inferential reasoning\nScott v London &amp; St Katherines Docks Co (1865) 3 H&amp;C 596 (Ex Ch\n\nThe idea that the happening of an event (the res) can itself be evidence of negligence without the need for further evidence of negligence\nThe plaintiff was injured when some bags of sugar fell onto him while he was standing near the doorway of the defendant’s warehouse.\n\n\nRes ipsa loquitur elements\n\n(a) the defendant must be in sole control of the situation; and\n(b) the accident must be of a kind that would not ordinarily happen unless someone is negligent; and\n(c) there is no explanation or knowledge of how the accident happened\n\n\n\n\nThe defendant in control of the situation\n\nDefendant must be in exclusive control\n\nKilgannon v Sharpe Bros Pty Ltd (1986) 4 NSWLR 60\n\ncourt decli\nMarch v E &amp; MH Stramare Pty Lt 1991 171 CLR 506\nned to allow reliance on res ipsa loquitur because the event, while suggesting that one of the three must have been negligent or even that all three might have been, did not identify which particular defendant or defendants had been negligent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe accident would not ordinarily happen but for negligence\n\na plaintiff must show that in the ordinary course of things, the accident would not have happened without negligence\n\nCommon knowledge standard\n\n\nPiening v Wanless (1968) 117 CLR 498\n\nthe plaintiff had been injured in an accident when the steering system of a car failed.\nToo complex to be standard knowledge\n\n\n\n\nThe cause of the accident is not known\n\nCan only aid if no proof of the plaintiff’s case where the actual cause of the accident is known\nBarkway v South Wales Transport Co Ltd [1950] 1 All ER 39\n\na bus crashed because a tyre had burst, it was held that res ipsa loquitur could not be relied upon because there was evidence of the circumstances of the accident.\n\n\n\n\nThe effect of reliance on res ipsa loquitu\n\neffect of the operation of the maxim is simply to enable the plaintiff to make out a prima facie case of negligence\n\noperation of the maxim does not involve a shift in the onus of proof to the defendant, nor does it raise some kind of presumption in the plaintiff’s favour\n\n\nThe maxim, when it applies, protects the plaintiff from a ‘no case to answer’ submission from the defendant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCh 14: Reform of the Law of Negligence in NSW\n\nCLA 2002 Part 1A division 3: Causation\n\ns 5D(1)\n\n(a) that the negligence was a necessary condition of the occurrence of the harm (factual causation); and\n(b) that it

approach to causation,\n\ntreating factual causation\nand scope of liability as separate issues.\n\n\n\n\nSection 5D(2) allows the courts to accommodate some ‘exceptional’ cases where the ‘necessary condition’ requirement in s 5D(1) cannot be met\nSubsection (3) of s 5D deals with the question of how to determine what a plaintiff would have done if the defendant had not been negligent, where that is an issue relevant to causation.\n\nCounters hindsight bias\nElbourne v Gibbs [2006] NSWCA 127\n\n\ns 5E abolished the common law ‘proposition’ that permitted a shift in the onus of proof to the defendant in some very limited circumstances.\n\nrestates the common law that the plaintiff always bears the onus of proving on the balance of probabilities any fact relevant to the issue of causation.\n\n\n\n\nBuljat v Coles Supermarkets Australia Pty Ltd [2022] ACTCA 71\n\nRuled against a customer who sustained injuries after slipping on grape in a Public Liability case.\n\nOriginally The Court held that although there was evidence that the floor had not been cleaned for six and half hours.\n\nIt was enough for employees to keep a proper lookout and simply clean as they go.\n\n\nThe Court held on appeal that there ought to have been at least some system which required staff to specifically identify and eliminate hazards.\n\nThe system needs to be adequate and there must be some evidence as to its effectiveness to protect customers.\nat least once an hour.\n\n\n\n\nAmaca Pty Ltd v Ellis (2010) held that a possible cause is not enough to establish causation\n\n\nPerformance Cars Ltd v Abraham [1962] 1 QB 33\n\na case concerning damage to property rather than personal injury.\nThe question for the English Court of Appeal was whether the defendant should be liable for the cost of respraying the car when it already required respraying at the time the defendant ran into it.\n\nThe court concluded that, as the defendant ‘takes the plaintiff as he finds him’, the defendant should not be liable for the respraying\n\n\nhad previously been run into by another negligent driver who had caused damage which necessitated the respraying

liability” ).\n\n\nWallace v Kam (2013) 250 CLR 375, [22] the High Court held that ‘Section 5D guides but does not displace common law methodology’\n\nthe common law test for remoteness of damage remains appropriate.\n\n\nMeandarra Aerial Spraying Pty Ltd v GEJ Geldard Pty Ltd [2013] 1 Qd R 319,\na case concerning aerial crop spraying that damaged the plaintiff’s crops some 20 kilometres from the site being sprayed\nWeber v Greater Hume Shire Council (2019) 100 NSWLR\n\na case concerning the escape of fire from the council’s rubbish tip and the destruction of the plaintiff’s house 11 kilometres away.\nThe court recognised that the question of remoteness was a relevant consideration in that case in application of the New South Wales civil liability provisions concerning both breach of duty and of scope of liability\n\n\nThe ‘Direct consequences’ Test\n\nIn the years before Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] AC 562, the courts had simply asked whether the damage claimed was a ‘direct consequence’ of the defendant’s act\n\n\nRe Polemis\n\nAccording to the ‘direct consequences’ test, a defendant would be liable for all damage flowing from the negligent act, no matter how improbable or far-fetched\nThe decision in Re Polemis was widely criticised as having the effect of making the potential liability of a defendant impossibly broad, particularly after the decision in Donoghue v Stevenson which extended the class of plaintiffs to whom a duty of care was owed.\n\n\n\nReasonable Foreseeability of Damage\nThe Wagon Mound (No 1) [1961] AC 388\n\nruled against the ‘direct consequences’ test\nreplaced it with a ‘reasonable foreseeability’ test for remoteness of damage.\nDefendant successful - not foreseable\n\n\nThe meaning of ‘reasonably foreseeable’\n\nThe Wagon Mound (No 2) was whether the risk of damage to the ships by fire was reasonably foreseeable.\n\na risk of injury was reasonably foreseeable if it was a ‘real risk … which would occur to the mind of a reasonable man … and which he would not brush aside as far-fetched’ (643, Lord Reid)\nPlaintiff successful\n\n\nApplied in chapman v hearse\nCattanach v Melchior (2003) 215 CLR\nconsidered the role of

State of South Australia for negligence, false imprisonment, misfeasance in public office, breach of fiduciary duties, and breach of procedural fairness.\nOriginal success attributed to colonial documentary evidence which was available to support his precise legal claims and the willingness of Justice Tom Gray to hear and give weight to Indigenous witnesses and expert socio-medical evidence\n\nThe court was able to use the state’s own records to prove that it had breached its own legislative scheme\n\n\nThe original Judge found that Mrs Angas and the APB acted without power when they placed Bruce Trevorrow in the care and custody of Mrs Davies, who was (after the event) approved as a foster parent.\n\nThe Judge found that Joseph Trevorrow and Thora Karpany did not consent to the placement, at the time or later.\nBruce Trevorrow died after judgment was entered for him.\n\nHis widow, as executrix of his estate, is the respondent to the appeal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent reason

missing evidence\nthe prejudice to the State through the unavailability of a number of potential witnesses and the loss of recall of other witnesses who were presented, is materially offset by the comprehensive and voluminous records kept by officers of the Aborigines Department, Department of Aboriginal Affairs and of the Child Guidance Clinic.\n\n\n\nA threshold question in Trevorrow and other Stolen Generations cases was whether the state could be held responsible for the unlawful actions of its related entities and officials\n\n\n\n\n\nAscertain the material facts\n\nBruce Trevorrow was removed from his family at 13 months old by stealth.\nFamily took baby to hospital, where he was unknowingly placed in state care\nHe simply disappeared from hospital.\n\nHis parents were given no explanation or opportunity to find out why\n\n\nWhen they tried to find him they experienced veiled threats with respect to removal of their other children.\n\nState officials, pretending to have powers which they did not have, placed Bruce with a white family who had responded to a newspaper advertisement offering Aboriginal children for adoption\n\n\nMrs Angas was unsympathetic to Bruce’s mother, 33 made unfounded presumptions about Bruce’s parents’ care for him being inadequate, 34 and misrepresented to Bruce’s mother that Bruce was still recovering in hospital when he had been fostered to a white family, the Davies.\n\nPolicy had changed, so what she did was no longer allowed\n\n\nOriginal Trial Judge (‘OTJ’) found Bruce Trevorrow was well cared for, even though he had had

she had no training for the role of foster mother, in particular, for the role of foster mother of an Aboriginal child\n\n\n\n\nThe manner of return took place in circumstances that fell below the standard of care required.\n\nThere was a breach of duty\nThe failure to provide more effective treatment to address the plaintiff’s problems permitted them to compound and become further entrenched, making the treatment in adult life all the more difficult.\nAdmitted for mental and behavioural problems\n\n\nDr Moffatt’s evidence demonstrated that the plaintiff was, at the time, mentally ill.\n\npoorly equipped to be placed into his mother’s home, effectively on minimal notice.\n\n\nIn 1963, the proclamation of the Aboriginal Affairs Act 1962 (SA) transferred guardianship of the

and South Australia, there is a presumption of contributory negligence where a passenger is injured in a motor accident and that person relies on a driver who is intoxicated.\nAllen v Chadwick (2015) 256 CLR 148,\n\nHigh Court considered s 47(2)(b) of the Civil Liability Act 1936 (SA) which establishes an exception to a presumption of contributory negligence, where an injured person could not reasonably be expected to have avoided the risk of riding with an intoxicated driver.\n\nIt was held that the facts of the plaintiffs situation should be taken into account in determining whether her decision to take the risk of riding with the intoxicated driver was reasonable:\n\n\nThe court held that s 47(2)(b) does not alter the common law position set out in Joslyn v Berryman (2003) 214 CLR 552, where it was held that a plaintiffs subjective mental state or emotional state is irrelevant to the objective reasonable choice expected.\n\n\n\n\nCivil liability legislation and intoxication\n\nthe civil liability legislation in all Australian jurisdictions (except Victoria) now presumes contributory negligence in all types of cases where an injured person was intoxicated at the time of the accident, unless not contributing to accident\ns 50 of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW), provides that a court must not award damages at all to an intoxicated plaintiff unless the death, injury or damage to the plaintiff would have occurred even if the plaintiff had not been intoxicated.\nRussell v Edwards [2006] NSWCA 19\n\nAshley Russell, was 16 years old and was a guest at a birthday party for 15 or 20 teenage guests, held by the defendants for their son at their home.\nThe defendants knew that the under-age guests were drinking alcohol and even provided some of the drinks consumed by the plaintiff and others\n\ndefendants allowed their young guests who showed obvious signs of intoxication to use the backyard swimming pool.\nThe plaintiff dived into the shallow end of the pool, struck his head and was severely injured.\n\n\nThe trial judge found that s 50 defeated the plaintiffs claim because all the requirements of the section were met: the plaintiff was intoxicated to the extent that his capacity to exercise reasonable care and skill was impaired, his intoxication caused his inability to judge the water depth and his injury was caused by his intoxication.\n\nSelf induced means voluntary in this case, ignorance is irrelevant\n\n\nCourt of Appeal held that Ashley Russell’s intoxication was the direct cause of his injury\n\n\nIn the later case of Amanda’s on the Edge Pty Ltd v Dries [2011] NSWCA 358, the New South Wales Court of Appeal apparently softened the application of s 50 in favour of an intoxicated plaintiff.\n\nThere Mr Dries fell from an unguarded/ unfenced wall, when walking across a lawn and garden in the dark, toward a place where he heard the voices of his friends.\nHe fell six feet into a driveway. Allsop P (with whom Beazley and Giles JJA agreed) held that s 50 did not apply although the plaintiff had been drinking\nThe provisions of the Motor Accident Injuries Act 2017 (NSW) s 4.17 govern the issue of intoxicated persons involved in motor accidents in New South Wales.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVoluntary Assumption of Risk (Volenti Non Fit Injuria)\n\nVoluntary assumption of risk or, by its Latin name volenti non fit injuria, means that an injury cannot be done to a willing person.\n\nSo, there can be no liability in negligence to a person who has voluntarily assumed the risk of being injure\nVoluntary assumption of risk, means that the plaintiff consents to a risk of injury, whereas in the trespass torts, the defence of ‘consent’ requires consent by the plaintiff to a particular act or event taking\nCapar v SPG Investments Pty Ltd [2020] NSWCA 354\n\nThe Civil Liability Act neither abolished nor codified common law principles with respect to assumption of risk; rather, s 5F and s 5G appear to have made quite specific changes to one aspect of the doctrine, namely awareness of risk.\n\n\n\n\nThe common law elements of the defence of voluntary assumption of risk\n\nThe elements of this defence were set out by the High Court in Roggenkamp v Bennett (19\t50) 80 CLR 292, 300\n\n(a) actually knew of the risk of injury; and\n(b) voluntarily accepted the risk of injury; and\n(c) understood the full nature and extent of the scope of the risk.\n\n\nActual knowledge of the risk\nAt common law, the test of voluntary assumption of risk is a subjective one.\nActual knowledge (not constructive knowledge)\n\nScanlon v American Cigarette Company (Overseas) Pty Ltd (No 3) [1987] VR 289\n\n\nThe defence of volenti has failed in intoxicated driver cases at common law where the plaintiff passenger was too drunk to know the defendant driver’s level of intoxication\n\nSloane v Kirby (1979) 25 SASR 263\n\nWhite J cited Professor John Fleming on the question of the degree of a driver’s drunkenness required before a defence of volenti would be maintainable, assuming the passenger was capable of knowledge and acceptance of the risk\n\n\n\n\nAt common law, whether or not a drunken passenger will be held to have assumed the risk of injury when they ride with a drunk driver depends on the level of actual knowledge they had as to the driver’s condition at the time.\n\nBanovic v Perkovic (1982) 30 SASR 34\n\n\nThe volenti defence is now not available in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia or the Australian Capital Territory where the driver is intoxicated (Motor Accident Injuries Act 2017 (NSW) s 4.1 unless the vehicle was involved in motor racing at the time\nVoluntary acceptance of the risk\n\nIn Haynes v G Harwood &amp;

Teamfox Pty Ltd v Fleissig [2002] NSWCA 371,\n\nwhere the plaintiff was severely injured in a go-cart race on a raceway during the course of his employment with Teamfox\nThe volenti defence pleaded by the occupier Oran Park, failed because whilst the plaintiff knew of the existence of the danger, he did not voluntarily accept the particular risks of injury that existed by reason of either defendants’ breach of the duty of care.\nHe did not accept the risk that he would be injured because of the defendants’ negligence.\n\n\nCapar v SPG Investments Pty Ltd [2020] NSWCA 354\n\na security guard who suffered psychiatric injury following an incident in the early hours one morning when an axe-wielding intruder threatened to kill him after breaking into the premises via a gap in the building’s roller-door entrance.\n\ndefect was known to the building occupier and the plaintiffs employer and there had been a prior break-in via the same entrance.\nThe plaintiff was unaware of these matters.\nThe defendant’s claim that he willingly undertook the risk which materialised was rejected\n\n\n\n\nExpress acceptance of the risk or exclusion of liability by notice\n\nExpress acceptance of a risk was considered in some older English authorities but they are not binding in Australia and it is likely they would be distinguished given their particular facts.\nIn Bennett v Tugwell [1971] 2 All ER 248, the plaintiff frequently rode in the defendant’s car which contained a sign stating ‘Warning.\n\nPassengers travelling in this vehicle do so at their own risk\nAs the terms of carriage had been expressly stated, the plaintiff was held to have voluntarily assumed the risk of the defendant’s negligent driving.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAppreciation of the full nature and extent of the scope of the risk\n\nThe defence will succeed only if the plaintiff is fully aware of the specific risk and its extent.\nIn Rootes v Shelton (1967) 116 CLR 383, the plaintiff was injured during the performance of a dangerous water-skiing exercise called ‘crossovers’ (involving three water skiers criss-crossing one another’s paths) when he crashed into a moored boat toward the edge of the river.\n\nThe court held that, while water skiing was dangerous, the plaintiff had not voluntarily assumed the risk of colliding with an obstruction in the water which he was not warned about where the collision was the result of the defendant’s negligence\n\n\n\n\nCivil liability legislation: a plaintiff is presumed to be aware of an ‘obvious risk’\n\nin an action for damages for breach of duty causing harm, a plaintiff is presumed to be aware of an ‘obvious’ risk.\n\nA defendant does not owe a duty to warn a plaintiff of an obvious risk and in some jurisdictions, there is no liability for injury caused by the materialisation of an obvious risk of a dangerous recreational activity\nAn obvious risk is defined as one that ‘in the circumstances, would have been obvious to a reasonable person in the position of [the plaintif]\n\nThe inquiry is adjusted according to the plaintiffs age and experience.\n\n\n\n\nA person is aware of the risk if they are aware of the ‘type or kind’ of risk, even if they are not aware of the precise nature, extent or manner of occurrence of the risk\n\nCollins v Clarence Valley Council [2015] NSWCA 263, the plaintiff was injured, during a charity bike ride, when the wheels of her bike were caught in the gaps between the planks on a wooden bridge.\n\nThe plaintiff admitted that she was aware of the gaps and that she did not dismount from her bike. The Court of Appeal held that the risk that the plaintiff may be injured by a fall if the bike wheel became stuck, was obvious.\nrisk was obvious under s 5F of CLA and the plaintiff was aware of the risk under s 5G of the CLA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatutory Defences\n\nObvious risks\n\nNo duty to warn of ‘obvious risks’\n\nGenerally, a defendant does not owe a duty of care to be proactive and to warn the plaintiff of an obvious risk\n\nThe provision does not apply if the plaintiff has requested advice or information from the defendant, or where the defendant is required by written law to warn the plaintiff of the risk, or where the defendant is providing professional services and the risk is one of death or personal injury to the plaintiff during the provision of those services\n\n\nIn Jaber v Rockdale City Council [2008] NSWCA 98, Tobias JA noted that the word ‘obvious’ is not defined in the CLA and referred to the definition of ‘obvious’ found in the USA Commentary to [343A] of the Restatement (Second) of Torts (1965),\n\n‘Obvious’ means that both the condition and the risk are apparent to and would be recognised by a reasonable man, in the position of the [plaintiff], exercising ordinary perception, intelligence and judgment.\n\n\nIn Kempsey Shire Council v Five Star Medical Centre Pty Ltd (2018) 99 NSWLR 98, the plaintiff company claimed that Kempsey Shire Council which owned and controlled an aerodrome, was negligent in failing to warn its pilot (by issuing an official ‘notice to airmen’ pursuant to civil aviation regulations) of the increased risk of colliding with a kangaroo on the runway, when kangaroo numbers had recently increased.\n\nThe claim for damage to the plaintiffs aircraft failed because the risk was held to be obvious and accordingly, the council did not owe a duty to warn of it pursuant s 5H\nkangaroo hazard was well known to pilots and the plaintiffs pilot was aware of a warning published by Airservices Australia for Kempsey Aerodrome, reading ‘Kangaroo hazard exists’.\n\n\nThe likelihood of a risk of injury occurring does not dictate whether a risk is obvious.\nIn Menz v Wagga Wagga Show Society Inc [2020] NSWCA 65, the plaintiffs horse was ‘spooked’ by a loud noise made by children in the vicinity of the warm-up arena, before the plaintiff was to compete in an equestrian event.\n\nA crucial issue in the appeal was whether the risk of an injury occurring this way, particularly in the warm-up area rather than in the competition, could be characterised as an ‘obvious risk’ of equestrian competition.\nThe plaintiff successfully argued that whilst competing in the event was a dangerous recreational activity, riding in the ‘warm up’ area beforehand, was not.\n\n\nTwo cases decided in the New South Wales Court of Appeal after Menz, that relied on the analysis of Leeming JA in Menz, were\n\nSingh v Lynch [2020] NSWCA 152 and\n\nplaintiff was a professional jockey injured when another jockey deliberately rode his mount to cause a collision with another horse, causing severe injury to Mr Singh, who was riding a third horse.\nrespondent’s (defendant’s) riding was ‘unexpected, unreasonable and also unnecessary’ and a\ndeliberate breach of the rules did not render it not obvious\n\n\nTapp v Australian Bushmen’s Campdraft &amp; Rodeo Association Ltd [2020] NSWCA 263.\n\nThe plaintiff claimed that the cause of her fall was a deterioration in the surface of the arena resulting from its use by many riders during the competition.\nThe majority Justices held that the plaintiff had failed to prove that her fall was the result of a deterioration in the surface and nor did she identify the way in which the surface of the arena had deteriorated\n\n\nIn each case the plaintiffs claim was defeated by s 5L of the CLA because their injuries were held to be caused by the materialisation of an obvious risk of a dangerous recreational activity.\n\n\nCox v Mid-Coast Council [2021] NSWCA 190,\n\nplaintiff was the pilot of a light aircraft who was injured when attempting to land at Old Bar Aircraft Landing Area (ALA) a grass landing strip that is an unlicensed

Conservation Commission of the Northern Territory (1998) 192 CLR 431\n\nThe majority of the High Court considered the obviousness of the risk as one factor going to the breach of duty question.\n\npublic authority concerned was not negligent in failing to warn of the danger of a cliff edge or to take steps to avoid it, because the danger was obvious to users of the reserve and it was reasonable to expect that entrants would exercise reasonable care for their own safety\n\n\n\n\nWoods v Multi-Sport Holdings Pty Ltd (2002) 208 CLR 460\n\nmajority of the High Court97 considered the issue of obviousness of the risk of injury from a cricket ball to the eye as one factor to be taken into account as part of the breach of duty inquiry.\n\ndefendant was held not to have acted

311,\n\nFacts\n\nIn a medical negligence case, the defendant successfully relied on the New South Wales inherent risk provision.\nradiologist Dr Cooke negligently failed to diagnose the aneurysm.\n\nIt was not diagnosed until 2006\n\n\nDuring operation, and without any negligence on the part of the surgeons, the aneurysm ruptured, causing the plaintiff to suffer a stroke and serious injuries.\nWhilst her aneurysm predated Dr Cooke’s negligent diagnosis, the relevant risk only arose after the aneurysm had been diagnosed and Ms Paul chose to undergo surgery.\n\n\nThe court held that Dr Cooke was not liable because his negligence did not create the risk of intraoperative rupture.\n\nThe risk was inherent because it could not be avoided by reasonable care on the part of Dr Cooke:\n\nthe risk was always present once Ms Paul developed the aneurysm.\n\n\n\n\ns 5I protection from liability is not confined to inherent risks that cannot be avoided by the exercise of reasonable care and skill by the defendant.\nIt applies to any inherent risk.\n\n\nSparks v Hobson; Gray v Hobson (2018) 361 ALR 115\n\nwas a medical negligence claim where the plaintiff suffered

sporting activities\n\nRisk warnings and exclusion clauses for recreational activities\n\ns 5k = recreational activity in New South Wales includes any sport, organised or not, and any pursuit or activity engaged in for enjoyment, relaxation or leisure;\n\nas well as any pursuit or activity engaged in at a place (such as a beach or park) where people ordinarily undertake such pursuits\n\n\n\n\nBeina Pty Ltd v Irwin [2009] NSWCA 46\n\na claim by a plaintiff who injured her knee when performing a lunge exercise as part of an exercise program devised and carried out pursuant to a gym membership contract.\n\n\nLiverpool Catholic Club Ltd v Moor [2014] NSWCA 394\n\nit was held that walking down the stairs towards an ice rink while wearing ice skates was not part of the

gate’ at a greyhound race\n\nargued that the words ‘any pursuit or activity’ in s 5K(c) should be limited to pursuits or activities that were recreational in character, otherwise that limb of the definition would be very wide.\n\n\nthe plaintiff was held to be engaged in a recreational activity because he was engaged in an activity at a place where ‘people ordinarily engage in … any pursuit or activity for enjoyment, relaxation or leisure’ (s 5K(c)).\nIrrelevant for avoiding justice, because for a defendant to avoid liability under s 5L, the defendant would have to prove that the activity was ‘dangerous’ and that any injury was the result of the materialisation of an obvious risk of the activity\n\n\n\n\nRisk Warnings\n\nA ‘risk warning’ is a warning given in a manner which is reasonably likely to result in people being warned of a risk before they engage in a recreational activity\n\ns 5M: no duty of care will be owed in respect of a risk of a recreational activity if the risk was the subject of a risk warning.\nA defendant may not rely on a risk warning given to an incapable person\n\n(including a child of a young age, or person with a physical or mental disability)\n\n\nexcept where the person was under the control of or accompanied by another capable person or their parent.\n\n\nAction Paintball Games Pty Ltd (in liq) v Barker [2013] NSWCA 128,\n\na girl, one day short of 10 years old, was not an ‘incapable person’ under s 5M(2) as firstly,her father was present when the warning was given and secondly, ‘a person is only an “incapable person” for the purposes of s 5M if they lack the capacity to understand the warning: s 5M(12).\n\ndefendant successfully relied on s 5M to avoid liability to the 10-year-old plaintiff who was injured playing ‘laser-tag’ when she fell whilst running on a rough bush track at the defendant’s facility\n\n\n\n\nSharp v Parramatta City Council [2015] NSWCA 260\n\nWhilst brief, this risk warning was held to be adequate to protect the council when Ms Sharp, the 24-year-old appellant was injured jumping from the platform.\nThe court also found the position of the sign — located at eye level at the entrance to the tower and displayed in large and clear letters — meant patrons accessing the platform were reasonably likely to have seen and understood the warning sign.\ndefence in s 5L applied.\n\n\nCoffs Harbour City Council v Polglase [2020] NSWCA 265.\n\nThere the council was liable to the 5-year-old plaintiff for failure to install additional wire strands or a mesh infill on a jetty railing fence to avoid the danger of a child falling four metres below.\nThe defendant relied on a risk warning at the entrance to the jetty which warned of the risks of diving from the jetty and stated at the end, ‘use of this facility may be hazardous please be careful’.\n\n\nBeina Pty Ltd v Irwin [2009] NSWCA 46,\n\nconsidered whether an acknowledgment signed by the plaintiff before undertaking an exercise program at a gym, was a ‘risk warning’ pursuant to s 5M.\nThe court held that this statement ‘did not warn the plaintiff about any risk involved in the lunge or any other exercise she undertook’ and that therefore it did not operate as a ‘risk warning’ in terms of s 5M\n\n\nMotorcycling Events Group Australia Pty Ltd v Kelly [2013] NSWCA 361\n\nconsidered whether s 5M applied where the plaintiffs claim for personal injury was in contract (for breach of a warranty as to due care and skill implied by statute) rather than in the tort of negligence\nit was held that the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) consumer protection legislation did not allow the operation of s 5M to avoid liability under that act (see discussion of this case below concerning exclusion clauses).\nFacts\n\nserious injury that occurred in 2007 during a training course at the Eastern Creek Raceway, relied upon the statutory warranties then implied by the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).\nclause excluding all liability ‘for death, personal injury or property damage howsoever caused’ and the defendant relied on s 5N.\nHeld if a plaintiff can frame a recreational injury claim in contract rather than tort, and relying on statutory warranties concerning due care and skill imposed by Commonwealth consumer protection legislation (now the Australian Consumer Law), then a purported waiver of liability will not be ‘saved’ by s 5N.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExclusion clauses\n\nexclusion is not available where the harm to the plaintiff results from the contravention of written safety laws.\nAlameddine v Glenworth Valley Horse Riding Pty Ltd [2015] NSWCA 219,\n\nthe exclusion clause signed on 21 May 2011 was held not to be a term or any part of the contract which was signed by all parties the previous day, 20 May, and therefore s 5N did not apply.\n\nthe purported term, inserted after the contract was formed and without any indication that the clause was intended to be part of the contract, was not binding and of no effect\n\n\nwhere the child plaintiff was injured riding a quad bike because the instructor caused her to travel at an excessive speed.\n\n\nInsight Vacations Pty Ltd v Young (2011) 243 CLR 149\n\nconcerned an exclusion clause in a contract for the provision of recreational services and is indicative of the problems of statutory inconsistency that may arise in Australia in view of nine

an overhead locker when the coach driver braked suddenly.\n\n\nbus tour came within the definition of a recreational activity in s 5K(b) of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW), being an activity engaged in for enjoyment, relaxation or leisure’ though not within the narrower definition in s 68B of the Trade Practices Act of the time.\n\ns 5N was not itself a State law directly limiting liability but simply a law which would enable parties to a contract to limit liability contractually\ns 5N applies only to contracts for the supply of recreational services to be performed within New South Wales ([36]).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo liability for the materialisation of an obvious risk of a dangerous recreational activity\n\nQuestions for materialisation of an obvious risk\n\nFirst, whether the plaintiff is engaged in a ‘dangerous recreational activity’ and\nSecondly, whether he or she was injured because of the materialisation of an ‘obvious risk’ of such an activity\n\n\nDefinition of obvious risk\n\ns 5F\n\nObvious risks are defined as those that ‘in the circumstances, would have been obvious to a reasonable person in the position of [the plaintiff\nA plaintiffs subjective knowledge or belief is irrelevant on the issue of whether the risk is obvious.\n\n\n\n\nDefinition of dangerous recreational activity\n\nThe definition of ‘dangerous recreational activity’ in New South Wales is one involving a ‘significant risk of physical harm’\nIn New South Wales the s 5L defence was first considered in Falvo v Australian Oztag Sports Association [2006] NSWCA 17,\n\nFacts\n\na case concerning a game of ‘tag’ rugby football’\nheld that the words ‘significant risk of physical harm’ in the s 5K definition of a dangerous recreational activity constitute ‘one concept with the risk and the harm mutually informing each other\n\n\nThe touch football game in Falvo’s case was held not to be a dangerous recreational activity so the s 5L defence did not succeed.\n\nThe plaintiffs case failed on causation.\n\n\n\n\nFallas v Mourlas (2006) 65 NSWLR 418,\n\nFacts\n\nthe plaintiff was shot by the defendant when they were sitting together in a stationary car while part of a group engaged in kangaroo shooting at night.\nThe plaintiff had remained in the car to hold the spotlight and the defendant, having re-entered the car, negligently discharged his gun when it was apparently jammed.\n\n\nIpp JA held that the word ‘significant’ must mean more than ‘trivial’ and that the test is more rigorous than the ‘undemanding’ Wyong Shire Council v Shirt (1980) 146 CLR 40 test for foreseeability of risk.\n\nNot high enough to mean ‘probable’\n\n\nThe activity in which the plaintiff was engaged in Fallas v Mourlas was characterised quite narrowly as ‘sitting in the vehicle, holding the spotlight for the other shoot-ers outside, on the basis that at various times one or more of the shooters might leave or enter the vehicle with firearms that might or might not be loaded’ ([75], Ipp JA).\n\nHis Honour held this to be an activity that involved a significant risk of physical harm and, therefore, dangerous.\nThe behaviour of the defendant in giving baseless reassurances to the plaintiff about the safety of the gun and in failing to take care to avoid the gun discharging in the car, constituted gross negligence which would not in the circumstances have been ‘obvious’ within the definition in s 5F\n\n\n\n\nThe New South Wales Court of Appeal rejected the s 5L defence in Doubleday v Kelly [2005] NSWCA 151 where the plaintiff who was seven years old and a house-guest of the defendants was injured while wearing roller skates on a trampoline.\n\nThe court found it unnecessary to consider the issue of whether the plaintiffs actions constituted a ‘dangerous recreational activity’ under s 5K because there was no doubt that the risk of injury was not obvious, under s 5F(1), to a child of seven years of age in the position of the plaintiff\n\n\nLormine Pty Ltd v Xuereb [2006] NSWCA 200\n\nthe plaintiff sued in respect of injuries received when she was a paying passenger aboard the defendant’s boat on a dolphin-watching cruise.\nThe plaintiff, who had been invited to sit at the bow of the vessel, was injured when she was swept heavily backwards when the boat was hit by a very large wave.\n\nThe incident was held to be the result of the negligence of the captain of the vessel.\n\n\nHis Honour held that the activity of dolphin watching which the defendant had described in its brochure as taking place in ‘calm ocean waters’, was, in all the circumstances, not a ‘dangerous recreational activity’ and that the statutory defence was not available.\n\n\nGreat Lakes Shire Council v Dederer (2006) Aust Torts Reps 1181-860\n\nFirst time s 5L defence was successful in NSWCA\nFacts\n\nThe plaintiff, who was 14.5 years old, became paraplegic when he dived off the Foster-Tuncurry Bridge into the tidal river below.\nThe evidence established that it was well known to the local council that the bridge was a very popular spot for young people to jump, and sometimes to dive, into the river\nThe plaintiff had twice jumped off the bridge into the river the day before his accident and he had, over many years, often seen other people jump or dive off the bridge.\nThe evidence was that in the 40 years since the bridge was built, until the plaintiffs injury, no known injury had occurred as a result of a person jumping or diving off the bridge.\n\n\nCourt held that the activity of diving from the bridge was a ‘dangerous recreational activity’ within s 5K\n\n\nJaber v Rockdale City Council [2008] NSWCA 98\n\ns 5L defence again succeeded in a situation where the 19-year-old plaintiff had dived head first off a bollard located at the end of a wharf under the management and control of the defendant council.\n\nThe plaintiff struck his head on the seabed and suffered serious spinal injury.\n\nThe plaintiff claimed that the council breached its duty of care to him by failing to warn him of the danger of diving off the pier\n\n\nHis Honour used the Fallas v Mourlas formulation of ‘significant risk’: that is a risk which is ‘somewhere between a trivial risk and one that is likely to occur’ with ‘significance’ being informed by the elements of both risk and physical harm.\n\n\nHis Honour also held that the risk which eventuated was an ‘obvious’ risk within the s 5F definition and that accordingly, the s 5L defence relieved the council of liability\n\n\nHolroyd City Council v Zaiter [2014] NSWCA 109\n\nthe court focused on the nature of the risk that eventuated and held that where it was not an ‘incident’ related to the dangerousness of the activity the s 5L defence would not operate.\nthe plaintiffs injury did not result from the materialisation of an obvious risk of the activity because the risk that materialised was not inherent in, or an incident of, the activity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessional sports persons\n\nIn Goode v Angland [2017] NSWCA 311 and Singh v Lynch [2020] NSWCA 152 , the New South Wales Court of Appeal expressly disagreed with the Tasmanian approach to the definition of recreational activity.\n\n\nThe New South Wales Court held in both cases, that a professional jockey is engaged in a recreational activity for the purpose of applying s 5L\n\n\nIn Goode v Angland,\n\nthe plaintiff jockey claimed that the negligent race riding of the defendant jockey caused interference with the plaintiffs horse, resulting in a fall and severe injury to the plaintiff\nThe plaintiff argued that the defendant could not rely on the s 5L because as a professional jockey, the plaintiff was not engaged in a recreational activity\n\n\n\naffirmed in Singh v Lynch\n\n\nNo doubt that in New South Wales, the dangerous recreational activity defence applies in cases of injury by obvious risks to professional sports persons.\n\nThe defence would preclude all professional (as well as amateur) sports persons from recovery for injury caused by the materialisation of obvious risks of dangerous sports\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 9 - Ch 15: Illegality\n\n\nGood Samaritans\n\nThe term ‘Good Samaritan’ is used in much of the legislation to refer to the person who comes to the aid of someone apparently injured or at risk of being injured\nTortious liability of Good Samaritan ss 55-58\n\n(a) Is there a positive duty to rescue?\n(b) Is the rescuer able to recover in the event that they themselves are injured during a rescue?\n(c) Is the rescuer liable where he or she exacerbates the condition of the person being rescued?\na person acting in good conscience who comes to the rescue of someone and is injured as a result, will have an action in negligence against the person whose fault created the situation of danger (Chapman v Hearse (1961) 106 CLR 112).\n\nincluding for mental harm (Mount Isa Mines Ltd v Pusey (1970) 125 CLR 383 and now Pt 3 of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW)).\n\n\n\n\nThe duty of care owed to rescuers includes professional rescuers, such as fire\n\nOgwo v Taylor [1988] AC 431,\n\nthe plaintiff fireman attended a fire negligently lit by the defendant and suffered serious burns from scalding steam as a result.\nThe defendant claimed that no duty was owed to professional firemen in respect of the ‘ordinary’ risks inherent in fire-fighting and that a duty would arise only where there were foreseeable, ‘exceptional’ risks involved\n\n\n\n\nThe policy of the law is to encourage the rescue of those in danger and this includes the act of rescuing property (Steel v Glasgow Iron and Steel Co Ltd 1944 SC 237).\nAt common law, a rescuer has a duty to take reasonable care during the rescue.\n\nIf the rescuer’s own negligent acts during the rescue cause or increase the injury to the plaintiff, it is possible that the rescuer will be liable in the tort of negligence (see Kent v Griffiths [2001] QB 36; Horsley v McLaren [1972] SCR 441).\n\n\n\n\n\nIn New South Wales, a Good Samaritan is a person who ‘in good faith and without expectation of payment or other reward, comes to the assistance of a person who is apparently injured or at risk of being injured’ in an emergency.\n\nThe protection does not apply to:\n\n(a) the Good Samaritan’s employer, where vicarious liability for their conduct operates (so, the conduct of an off duty ambulance officer who acts negligently may be the responsibility of his or her employer, if the officer is acting in the course of the employment);\n(b) a Good Samaritan who causes the initial personal injury;\n(c) a Good Samaritan who is under the influence of drugs and alcohol which they voluntarily consumed and which significantly impaired their ability to use reasonable care and skill and the Good Samaritan does fail to use reasonable care and skill;\n(d) a Good Samaritan who impersonates a health care or emergency services worker or police officer or falsely represents skills with respect to emergency assistance\n\n\n\n\n\nStatutory Protection of Food Donors\n\nImmunity from civil liability, for death or personal injury, for food donors has been included in civil liability legislation in all Australian jurisdictions\nThe food must have been safe to consume at the time it left the possession or control of the donor and the donor must have given adequate information about the handling requirements of the food as well as the time limit for safe consumption to the person or organisation to which it was donated.\n\n\n\nThe criminals and Illegal Activity\n\nThe illegality of a plaintiff’s actions may operate as a complete defence at common law\nMiller v Miller (2011) 242 CLR 44 = s 54 of the Civil Liability Act 2002\n\nThe fact that a plaintiff suffered injury from negligence whilst the plaintiff was engaged in illegal activity does not necessarily afford a defence to an action in negligence but in cases of joint illegal activity (where the plaintiff and the defendant are engaged together in a criminal act), it may result in the denial of a duty of care to the plaintiff.\nFacts\n\nThe 16-year-old plaintiff, who had been drinking, suffered catastrophic injuries when she was one of nine passengers in a car which she had stolen and which was being driven by her 27-year-old uncle.\n\nThe plaintiff asked the defendant driver twice to let her out of the car when he was driving in a dangerous manner, speeding and failing to stop at red lights.\nThe defendant refused to stop to let the plaintiff out of the car and he eventually lost control of the car which crashed.\n\n\n\n\nIssue\n\nwhether the plaintiff’s part in the joint illegal activity of stealing and riding in the stolen car, defeated her claim in negligence.\n\n\nHeld\n\nWithdrawn from the joint illegal enterprise\n\nemphasised not the relationship between the illegal activity and the plaintiff’s injury, but the issue of whether imposing a duty of care would result in incongruity in the law.\n\n\nThe decision in Miller represents a significant shift in the approach of the common law to the defence of illegality with the emphasis on consistency of tort law with other areas of the law and on the careful identification of the particular statutory purpose of the legislation proscribing the plaintiff’s conduct.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe common law before Miller v Miller\n\nBefore the High Court decision in Miller v Miller, the common law focus was on the question of whether the illegal activity enabled the court to fix a standard of care\n\nGala v Preston (1991) 172 CLR 24\n\nTwo components to the defence of illegality:\n\nthe illegal nature of the act or enterprise and\nits relationship to the negligence in question.\n\n\nFacts\n\nthe plaintiff was injured when the car in which he was a passenger hit a tree.\nThe car had been stolen by the plaintiff and the defendant, who had been drinking alcohol, and taken a ‘joy ride’ together.\n\nThe court found that illegality operated as a defence as the parties were engaged in a joint illegal enterprise.\n\nThe court held that the defendant driver of the stolen car did not owe a duty of care to the plaintiff passenger given the exceptional circumstances of the joint illegal enterprise of stealing the car.\n\n\n\n\nNow outweighed by Miller v Miller\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe statutory defence of illegality\n\nrecovery is excluded where the court is satisfied that the plaintiff was injured while engaging in conduct which constitutes a ‘serious’ offence, being one punishable by imprisonment for more than six months\n\nthe illegal nature of the plaintiff’s actions is determined on the civil standard of proof: that is on the balance of probabilities\ndamages may be awarded in NSW where the conduct of the defendant which causes the injury, death or damage constitutes an offence\n\n\ns 54 of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) states that ss 52 and 53 (self-defence) ‘can apply to prevent or limit recovery of damages even though the defendant’s conduct constitutes an offence’.\n\nApplied in SW v Khaja [2020] NSWCA 128\n\nplaintiff, SW suffered a serious spinal injury when during a struggle between the plaintiff and the defendant taxi driver, the taxi moved forwards and SW fell out of the passenger side door.\nThe defendant said that SW threatened him with a knife and attempted to rob him.\n\nThe trial judge accepted the evidence of the defendant and held that SW was engaged in an illegal act, and that s 54 prevented her recovering any damages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatt v New South Wales [2018] NSWSC 1926\n\nGarling J considered the requirement that the plaintiff’s injury must follow a serious criminal offence, for s 54 of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) to exclude liability\n\nFacts\n\nthe plaintiff was injured in a deliberate attack by another inmate whilst being held on remand in a prison cell.\nHe claimed that the prison employees had failed to take reasonable care to prevent the assault by the other prisoner whose violence was known to them\nThe State relied on s 54 arguing that the plaintiff’s injury was suffered following conduct constituting a serious offence because the plaintiff and his assailant had an altercation in another area of the prison earlier the same day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe preservation of the common law principles concerning illegality\n\nThere is a general provision in the civil liability legislation to the effect that a provision of the legislation giving protection from civil liability does not limit the protection given by law\n\nThe New South Wales provision in s 3A, ‘cannot be determinative’ and ‘cannot of itself preclude … the statute being regarded as laying down a set of principles to cover the relevant field to the exclusion of the common law principles previously applicable’\n\n\nBevan v Coolahan [2019] NSWCA 217\n\nConsidered s 54 defence of illegality and whether it excluded the operation of the Miller v Miller common law principles\nFacts\n\nMs Bevan was injured when the car in which she was a passenger crashed into a telegraph pole because of the negligent driving of Mr Coolahan whilst they and two other occupants of car were participants in a joint criminal enterprise having obtained and used illicit drugs (crystal methamphetamine).\nIt was held that ‘the trip to the dealer’s premises, the purchase of drugs, the consumption of part of the drugs, and the subsequent trip home, all constituted part of the joint enterprise’\n\n\nA major issue in the appeal was whether s 54 governed the area of illegal activity by a plaintiff entirely.\n\nIf so, the common law could have no application at all.\n\n\nHeld that ‘s 54 is not exhaustive’ and that it does not exclude the operation of the common law.\nApplying the principles in Miller v Miller, the court held that the plaintiff was not owed a duty of care by the defendant\n\n\n\n\nApologies\n\nAt common law, admissions of regret or apologies will not generally constitute admissions of liability (Dovuro Pty Ltd v Wilkins (2003) 215 CLR 317) and will have little evidentiary value on the breach of duty issue.\n\nan apology is not admissible in civil proceedings as evidence of the fault or liability of the person by whom or on whose behalf it is made\n\n\nApology def NSW\n\nan ‘expression of sympathy or regret, or of a general sense of benevolence or compassion, in connection with any matter whether or not the apology admits or implies an admission of fault in connection with the matter’\n\n\nthe protection applies to ‘civil liability of any kind’ except for defamation or liability excluded by s 3B, being for intentional acts done with intent to cause injury; dust disease and smoking claims; and motor accident and workplace injury claims\n\n\nRust v needham\n\nBike ride no helmet\n\nDid not affect contributory negligence because it made no difference\n\n\n\n\nFroom v butcher\n\nNo seatbelt for accident didn’t cause, court of appeal said there was contributory negligence because not putting on seat bealt contributed to the harm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 10: CATEGORIES OF DUTY OF CARE - Special Categories\nAtypical Plaintiffs and Specific Duty Categories\n\n\nAtypical plaintiff def\n\nsomeone who either physically or mentally is susceptible to suffering injury where an ‘ordinary’ person would not be.\nTo balance out the difficulty in creating too high a burden on those owing a duty of care with the need for people to be fully compensated, the law:\n\ndoes not require the person owing the duty to take special precautions to prevent an atypical plaintiff suffering injury (because, essentially, it would extend forseeability too far); BUT\nit allows the atypical plaintiff to recover damages for ALL of their injuries if they suffer injury in circumstances where a typical person would have suffered injury through the negligence of the tortfeasor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16.2 The unborn child\n\nIn law, the foetus has no legal identity.\r\n- The law recognises that the foetus will become a child upon birth while at the same time denying the foetus a legal identity until it is born.\nIn Attorney-General (Qld) (Ex rel Kerr) v T (1983) 46 ALR 275, a father attempted to prevent the mother of the unborn child having an abortion.\n\nThe court upheld the traditional ‘born alive’ rule that a child has no legal rights until it is born alive.\n\nThe court refused to intervene to prevent the abortion\n\n\n\n\nThe law does recognise that the unborn child is owed a duty of care.(Watt v Rama [1972] VR 353.)\r\n- An action at law for damages suffered through negligent acts or omissions arising during pregnancy may only be brought following birth, when a child has a legal identity and can sue.\r\n- Thus, pre-birth injury may occur:\n\n(a) before the child is conceived;\n(b) ex utero (during in vitro fertilisation); or\n(c) in utero (including during birth)\n\n\nNegligence before conception\n\nA defendant may be held liable for negligent acts or omissions affecting a child not yet conceived.\nIn X and Y v Pal (1991) 12 NSWLR 26, an obstetrician failed to do a routine test on a pregnant woman for syphilis.\n\nThe court held that the obstetrician owed a duty of care not only to her and the foetus she was then carrying, but also to a future unborn child who became infected with syphilis during a subsequent pregnancy.\n\n\nIn Kosky v Trustees of the Sisters of Charity [1982] VR 961, a woman was given an incompatible blood transfusion in hospital.\n\nThe transfusion introduced a disorder into her blood system and the child later conceived became affected.\n\n\n\n\nEx utero\n\nWaller v James [2002] NSWSC 462, the New South Wales Court of Appeal considered a ‘wrongful life’ action where the plaintiff claimed that he was owed a duty of care by his mother’s health professionals in respect of advice to his parents concerning IVF treatment that resulted in his conception.\n\nThe plaintiff argued that the duty extended to providing his parents with all information regarding his potential health, thereby enabling them to make a decision to forgo the IVF treatment that would have resulted in the plaintiff not being born at all.\n\n\nThe Court of Appeal (and subsequently the High Court) held that the plaintiff was not owed a duty of care, the effect of which was to prevent his birth: that there was no ‘wrongful life’ duty of care.\n\nWaller v James was appealed to the High Court on the issue of the ‘wrongful life’ duty of care and the plaintiff was again unsuccessful:\n\nWaller v James (2006) 226 CLR 136\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn utero\n\nWatt v Rama [1972] VR 353\nIn this case, a pregnant woman was involved in a car accident which was caused by the negligence of the defendant.\nThe foetus she was carrying was injured in the accident and was born with brain damage, epilepsy and severe paralysis\n\nThe court held that pregnancy can reasonably be foreseen by members of the community;\n\ntherefore, drivers owe a duty of care to unborn children, though the child cannot bring an action in negligence until he or she is born suffering damage when the cause of action is complete.\n\n\n\n\nLynch v Lynch (1991) 25 NSWLR 411,\n\nthis duty was imposed on an unborn child’s mother where the child sued her own mother for negligent driving.\nIn this case, a child was born with cerebral palsy, caused while in utero by a car accident attributable to her mother’s negligence.\n\nThe mother was held to owe a duty of care to her own unborn child and the child plaintiff was able to recover damages from her mother after her birth.\n\n\nThe fact that this case did not establish a general duty of care by a mother to her foetus was affirmed in the Queensland case of Bowditch v McEwan [2003] 2 Qd R 615\n\nwhich followed Lynch and confirmed that the principle that a child may recover damages from its mother for her negligent conduct extends only to the mother’s negligent driving rather than a more general duty encompassing all of a mother’s conduct during pregnancy.\n\n\n\n\nBowditch v McEwan states that lifestyle issues, such as whether a pregnant mother smokes, drinks etc, will not lead to damages being recoverable by a child who asserts he or she has been injured through such behaviour.\n\n\n\n\n\n16.3 Unborn children and Wrongful birth\n\nWrongful birth actions are taken against medical practitioners by the parents of a child, and rely upon the duty of care owed by medical personnel to the parents (who are the patients) and allege that, if the defendant had not been negligent, the child would not have been born at all.\n\nThe common law in this instance has been reversed by civil liability legislation\n\n\nThe authority in this area is Cattanach v Melchior (2003) 215 CLR 1 where the High Court considered the question:\n\n[i]f, in consequence of medical negligence, a couple become the parents of an unintended child, can a court, in an award of damages, require the doctor to bear the cost of raising and maintaining the child? ([1], Gleeson CJ)\nThe appeal to the High Court was from a decision of the Queensland Court of Appeal, which held that the parents could recover the costs of raising an unplanned and non-disabled child born as the result of a failed tubal ligation procedure\n\nThis type of case has often been categorised as a ‘wrongful birth’ claim.\n\nThe use of the terminology has, however, been criticised by the High Court.\nwrongful birth’ tag deflected attention from this being a case about negligent advice ([193])\n\n\n\n\nHeld:\n\nby a bare majority that the duty of care of a medical practitioner extended to responsibility for the cost of raising a child born as a result of the defendant’s negligence.\n\n\nThe principles in Cattanach v Melchior were relied upon by the plaintiffs in Waller v James [2015] NSWCA 232 which was decided on common law principles because the original proceedings pre-dated the Civil Liability Act 2002\n\n\nThe defendant in the parents’ claim in Waller v James was the doctor who had coordinated IVF treatment for them and who had failed to explain the importance of a reference for genetic counselling regarding the risk of inheritance of a genetic condition called ATD from the father.\n\nThe plaintiffs’ child was born with that condition.\nHeld\n\nThe plaintiff parents were unsuccessful in their claim because they were unable to prove that the severe disabilities suffered by the child were the result of the defendant doctor’s negligent failure to warn them of the possibility of the genetic condition.\nThe medical evidence was that the stroke was not caused by the genetic defect.\n\nAccordingly, the damage was not caused by the defendant’s breach of duty, even though the plaintiffs would not have undergone the IVF treatment until the genetic risk could be eliminated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVeivers v Connolly [1995] 2 Qd R 326, the plaintiff lost the opportunity to terminate her pregnancy lawfully because of the negligence of the defendant.\n\nAs a result, a severely handicapped child was born.\nDe Jersey J held that damages recoverable included the costs associated with past and future care of the child extending for a 30-year period, this being the child’s life expectancy.\n\n\nIn CES v Superclinics (Australia) Pty Ltd (1995) 38 NSWLR 47,\n\nthe appellant/plaintiff claimed damages for loss of the opportunity to terminate her pregnancy lawfully, after repeated and inexcusable failure to diagnose her pregnancy by the defendant clinic’s several doctors, on multiple occasions and over several months.\nIn addition, she was wrongly advised by the clinic over the phone about the results of a pregnancy test.\n\nThe New South Wales Court of Appeal held by majority that the damages recoverable did not include the costs of raising the child.\nKirby ACJ found that the termination procedure would not have been unlawful in relation to the plaintiff and therefore that the only issue that might prevent her recovery of damages could be public policy\n\n\n\n\nG and M v Armellin [2009] ACTCA\nMs G and her partner Ms M wanted to continue to raise both children but the issue before the court was that they had only wished to have one child and claimed that, in implanting two embryos instead of one into Ms G’s uterus during the IVF procedure, the treating doctor, Dr Armellin,was negligent.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued that Ms G had informed Dr Armellin in theatre that she wanted only one embryo implanted and that the subsequent implantation of two embryos by the embryologist was therefore caused by the negligence of Dr Armellin.\n\n\nIn the Court of Appeal, the joint judgment of Higgins CJ, Refshauge and Marshall JJ reversed the finding of Bennett J and held Dr Armellin to be negligent.\n\nThe trial judge’s assessment of damages was upheld on appeal\n\n\nCivil liability legislation reverses Cattanach v Melchior\n\nCLA prevents a court from awarding damages for either the costs associated with rearing or maintaining a non-disabled child or any loss of future earnings while the plaintiff rears the child.\n\ns 70 states that it applies to any civil claims for damages for the birth of a child, in tort, contract, under statute or otherwise (s 70(1)), but not to claims for personal injuries sustained by a child prenatally or during birth (s 70(2)).\nSection 71 provides:\n\n(1) In any proceedings involving a claim for the birth of a child to which this Part applies, the court cannot award damages for economic loss for:\n\n(a) the costs associated with rearing or maintaining the child that the claimant has incurred or will incur in the future, or\n(b) any loss of earnings by the claimant while the claimant rears or maintains the child.\n\n\n(2) Subsection (1)(a) does not preclude the recovery of any additional costs associated with rearing or maintaining a child who suffers from a disability that arise by reason of the disability.\n\n\nThis means that in New South Wales damages for economic loss for the costs of raising a non-disabled child cannot be awarded.\n\nIt should be possible to claim other Cattanach v Melchior damages such as for the mother’s physical pain and suffering during pregnancy and labour and costs associated with the pregnancy.\nSuch costs may include medical costs and unpaid maternity leave.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16.4 Unborn children and Wrongful\n\n‘wrongful life’ claim is one made by a plaintiff (often while still a child) who was born as a result of the negligence of the defendant.\nThe claim is not that the defendant has injured the plaintiff in utero but rather that the defendant’s negligence has allowed the plaintiff to be born.\n\nThe child plaintiffs in these cases are invariably disabled and claim damages to enable them to have the significant and costly extra care required by a disabled person.\n\nThe loss suffered by the children is their ‘life with disability’ as opposed to non-existence\n\n\nThere is no doubt that the medical advisers owe a duty of care to their patients (the mothers) but the issue in the ‘wrongful life’ claims brought by the children is whether the mothers’ medical advisers owe a duty of care to the children born as result of their failure to properly treat, diagnose or advise the mothers\n\n\nHarriton v Stephens (2006) 226 CLR 52 and Waller v James (2006) 226 CLR 136\n\nActions for ‘wrongful life’ are not available in Australian common law:\n\nmedical advisors owe no duty of care to a child born disabled because the doctor failed to advise the child’s mother during her pregnancy of circumstances which would have led the child’s mother to obtain a lawful termination of that pregnancy or to have avoided the pregnancy.\n\n\n\n\nIn Harriton v Stephens, the child plaintiff was born with very severe disabilities as a result of her mother having contracted rubella in the early stages of pregnancy.\nThe overriding reason for the refusal to impose a duty of care in a ‘wrongful life’ case was the impossibility of defining and assessing the damage claimed\nHeld\n\nIn Harriton v Stephens, the High Court on appeal held\n\nThat part of the reason the Plaintiff could not succeed was a comparison, for damages purposes, between being born with disabilities and not being born at all was impossible\nA duty of care cannot be stated where the Plaintiff can never prove the actual damage claimed\nThat a doctor does not owe a duty to a fetus to prevent their birth\nPublic policy reasons may be relevant to a determination of the duty issue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16.6 Psychiatric Illness: The Historical Transition from Nervous Shock to Pure Mental Harm\n\nA defendant may have a legal duty to take care to avoid pure psychiatric or psychological harm to a plaintiff.\n\nThis refers to the situation where a plaintiff’s state of mind is injured through the defendant negligently causing external events.\nThe word ‘pure’ is used to describe the mental harm as it refers to a psychiatric or psychological illness which is not caused by or related to any physical injury caused by the defendant.\nconsequential mental harm\nJaensch v Coffey (1984) 155 CLR 549: Influential case\n\nthe Australian High Court allowed recovery for pure mental harm and expanded the circumstances in which a duty of care would be imposed at common law\nFacts\n\nMrs Coffey’s husband was riding a motorcycle and suffered serious injury in a collision with a vehicle which was being driven negligently by the defendant, Mr Jaensch\n\nShe was informed by telephone at 5.30 am the next morning that her husband was in intensive care and at 8.30 am to come to the hospital quickly because he had had ‘a change for the worse’\nHis condition gradually improved over the following weeks and he made a full recovery.\nA week after the accident, Mrs Coffey began to experience the first symptoms of an anxiety depressant state and psychiatric illness followed\n\n\n\n\nHeld\n\nThe High Court found that, although she had not received a sudden shock and she had not witnessed the accident, she had perceived the aftermath of the accident when at the hospital.\n\nThe court held in a unanimous decision that the defendant owed her a duty of care not to cause psychiatric injury and she was able to recover damages for pure mental harm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16.6.1 Historical evolution: from ‘nervous shock’ to pure mental harm\n\nThe common law has, for much of its history, insisted upon treating pure mental harm as requiring legal tests which differ from those which allow recovery of damages for negligently inflicted physical injury.\nDue to Tame v New South Wales; Annetts v Australian Stations Pty Ltd (2002) 211 CLR 317, and the implementation of the Ipp Report through statute in most jurisdictions the parameters of the duty of care for mental harm have undergone considerable transition.\n‘pure mental harm’ → ‘nervous shock’\nTimeline: 1885-2003\n\n\n16.6.2 Common law: the High Court and pure mental harm\n\nThe historical approach of the common law was to allow recovery for pure mental harm only where the plaintiff could establish that he or she had suffered a sudden shock at the scene or in the aftermath of an accident\n\nChanged in Tame v New South Wales; Annetts v Australian Stations Pty Ltd (2002) 211 CLR 317\n\nthe court held that the duty of care must be determined by reference to the reasonable foreseeability of the plaintiff as a person who would suffer psychological injury if the defendant was negligent.\n\n\n\n\nIn Annetts v Australian Stations Pty Ltd, the son of the plaintiffs, James Annetts, was 16 years of age when he left his family home to work as a jackaroo on the defendant’s remote cattle station at Flora Valley, 40 kilometres away from Halls Creek in the Kimberley District of Western Australia.\n\nFacts\n\nOn 6 December 1986, his parents were telephoned by a police officer in New South Wales, who told them that James had gone missing on 3 December 1986 in Western Australia.\nIn January 1987, Mr and Mrs Annetts began a series of trips to Halls Creek where they were shown belongings of their son that had been found, including a hat covered in blood.\nThe Annetts had confirmation by phone that James was dead five months after they first knew of his disappearance.\n\n\nIpp J found that, while the employer might foresee that Mr and Mrs Annetts would suffer deep anxiety and grief on learning of their son’s disappearance and death, it could not reasonably foresee that they might suffer psychiatric injury.\n\nParents should have more fortitude\nIpp J held that the claim failed because on 6 December 1986 there was no perception by the parents of a distressing phenomenon and that the confirmation of James’ death at the end of April 1987 was not a sudden sensory perception of a distressing event.\n\n\nThe High Court allowed the Annetts’ appeal, holding that it was reasonably foreseeable that the plaintiffs would suffer psychiatric injury in the circumstances.\n\nThe prior relationship between the defendant and the plaintiffs was a significant factor in the duty of care consideration:\nthe defendant had assured the plaintiffs that their son would be adequately supervised.\n\n\n\n\nTame v State of New South Wales (2002) 211 CLR 317, was heard with the Annetts case.\n\nFacts\n\nOn 11 January 1991, Mrs Tame was involved in a collision with another vehicle driven by Mr Lavender who was clearly at fault, for he had a blood alcohol reading of 0.14 (three times the lawful limit) and was driving on the wrong side of the road.\nThe other driver’s blood alcohol level was incorrectly entered against her name as a result of a clerical error by the defendant. Mrs Tame’s real reading was zero.\nMrs Tame had, for many years, an abhorrence of drinking and driving.\nShe had consumed very little alcohol in the previous 20 years and she was horrified at the suggestion.\nMrs Tame became obsessed with the mistake on the form as she began to worry about the detrimental effect she considered the error on the accident report would have on her reputation.\n\n\nHeld\n\na plaintiff must demonstrate a recognisable psychiatric injury\nreasonable foreseeability remained a requirement to establish the duty\nbut injury to a person of normal fortitude was not a requirement\nthere were relevant considerations as to the existence of a duty such as how the incident was perceived and the person’s relationship with the victim\n\n\nThe court held that, in nervous shock cases, the law imposes only a duty to take reasonable care to avoid psychiatric injury to a person of ‘normal fortitude’\n\nThis meant that in a case such as Mrs Tame’s, where there is absence of actual knowledge of a particular susceptibility, it is not reasonably foreseeable that a person of normal fortitude might sustain psychiatric injury from a clerical mistake of the type that occurred here\n\n\nHCA dismissd Mrs Tame’s appeal on the basis that the psychiatric injury Mrs Tame suffered was not reasonably foreseeable.\nThe decisions in Tame and Annetts outlined the following common law principles relevant to the duty of care in respect of negligently caused mental harm:\n\n(a) The plaintiff must demonstrate a recognisable psychiatric injury (Gaudron, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Callinan JJ).\n(b) Reasonable foreseeability is a requirement for the duty of care to be established; however, ‘normal fortitude’ is not a prerequisite to establishing a duty in all cases (Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ).\n(c) Relevant considerations to determine a duty of care include the directness of the perception of the event by the claimant; their relationship with the person killed, injured or placed in peril; the nature of the shock; and whether there is any pre-existing relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant.\n\n\nThe court stressed that none of these factors is a precondition for recovery.\n\n\nThe principles in Annetts and Tame were applied in Koehler v Cerebos (Aust) Ltd (2005) 222 CLR 44 where the High Court of Australia found on common law principles that an employer did not breach a duty of care in negligence to an employee not to inflict a stress-related psychiatric injury on her.\n\nthe plaintiff’s injury was not the result of shock but rather, it was the result of workplace stress.\n\nIn Koehler, the employee was a full-time sales representative. She was retrenched by her employer and during the course of her part-time employment, she complained to the management on many occasions about her workload:\n\n‘she complained orally and in writing on many occasions that she had too big an area, too many stores and very little time’ but at no point did she suggest that these matters were affecting her mental health\n\n\nTheir Honours stated that the ‘content of the duty which an employer owes an employee to take reasonable care to avoid psychiatric injury cannot be considered without taking account of the obligations which the parties owe one another under the contract of employment’\n\nImportantly, the High Court reaffirmed the importance of examining the scope of the duty of care owed by the defendant.\n\nThe High Court held in Koehler that a reasonable employer would not have foreseen the risk of psychiatric illness to the employee as a result of the tasks the plaintiff had agreed to carry out under the contract of employment.\n\n\n\n\npsychiatric injury in the work-place will only be reasonably foreseeable when there are, ‘signs and symptoms of psychiatric illness of the particular employee which are reasonably apparent to the employer’\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16.6.3 Civil liability legislation and pure mental harm\n\nCivil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) Pt 3 s 30 restricts recovery for pure mental harm to certain categories of person:\n\n(2) The plaintiff is not entitled to recover damages for pure mental harm unless:\n\n(a) the plaintiff witnessed, at the scene, the victim being killed, injured or put in peril, or\n(b) the plaintiff is a close member of the family of the victim.\n\n\n\n\nThe meaning of s 30(2)(a) was considered in a unanimous joint judgment by the Full High Court in Wicks v State Rail Authority of New South Wales (2010) 241 CLR 60.\n\nThe appellants, Mr Wicks and Mr Sheehan, were New South Wales policemen who were amongst the first to arrive to assist the dead and injured at a rail crash.\nA passenger train derailed at high speed near Waterfall Station (south of Sydney) on the morning of 31 January 2003.\n\nSeven people died and many others were seriously injured.\n\ndeath; injury; the wreckage of the train; overhead electrical cables lying across the wreckage; injured people thrown out of the train and passengers trapped, seriously injured, and very distressed.\n\n\n\n\nState Rail admitted negligence but argued that the appellants were unable to show that they witnessed any of the victims ‘being killed, injured or put in peril’ (emphasis added).\n\nState Rail argued that the word ‘being’ as used in s 30(2)(a) meant that the appellants had to witness the event in which people were killed, injured or imperilled and so could not recover as by the time the police officers arrived on the scene the accident had already happened.\n\n\nThe High Court, noting that extrinsic materials offered no guidance on the interpretation of this provision, overturned the Court of Appeal decision\n\nThe High Court rejected the arguments of State Rail as to both the interpretation of s 30(2)(a) and a secondary argument that Pt 3 of the Civil Liability Act requires that a plaintiff must demonstrate that the psychiatric injury of which complaint is made was occasioned by observation of what was happening to a particular victim.\n\n\nThe High Court found for the appellants, as ‘the survivors of the derailment remained in peril until they had been rescued by being taken to a place of safety.\n\nMr Wicks and Mr Sheehan witnessed, at the scene, victims of the accident being put in peril as a result of the negligence of State Rail’\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16.6.4 Establishing a duty of care for pure mental harm following Annetts and civil liability legislation\n\nThe High Court in Wicks v State Rail Authority of New South Wales (2010) 241 CLR 60 provided guidance as to how to approach interpretation of Pt 3 of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW).\n\nThe duty of care question must be resolved before other statutory limitations on recovery for mental harm which exist in the civil liability legislation are determined.\n\n\nRequirements for a duty of care in pure mental harm cases from CLA:\n\nThe first requirement is that there must be a recognised psychiatric illness.\nthe second is reasonable foreseeability that a person of ‘normal fortitude’ would suffer a recognised psychiatric illness if care were not taken,\nand the third is that the circumstances of the case must be considered in order to determine the reasonable foreseeability issue\n\nsuch as whether the plaintiff witnessed the accident and the relationship of the plaintiff to the person injured\n\n\n\n\n16.6.4.1 A ‘recognised psychiatric illness\n\nIn all Australian jurisdictions, there is a distinction between mere grief or sorrow and a recognised psychiatric injury.\nUnder both common law and statute, ‘grief and sorrow’ will not give rise to damages.\n\na plaintiff must establish that they have an injury: a recognised psychiatric illness\nOne of the most cited passages which refers to the necessity for a recognisable psychiatric illness or injury to establish recovery in nervous shock at common law is that of Brennan J in Jaensch v Coffey (1984) 155 CLR 549\n\nIn Tame v New South Wales; Annetts v Australian Stations Pty Ltd (2002) 211 CLR 317, the High Court confirmed that damages are only recoverable in negligence for a recognisable psychiatric injury and not for emotional distress.\n\n\n\n\n‘save in exceptional circumstances, a person is not liable, in negligence, for being a cause of distress, fear, anxiety, annoyance, or despondency, without any resulting recognised psychiatric illness’.\n\nProof of a psychiatric disorder or illness is required, although the exact nature of the plaintiff’s illness does not need to be foreseeable\n\nMount Isa Mines\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoates v Government Insurance Office of New South Wales (1995) 36 NSWLR 1\n\nFacts\n\nSteven Coates was 14 years old and Suzanne Coates was 11 years old at the time of their father’s death.\nThey did not witness the accident in which their father was killed and nor were they involved in the aftermath.\nThey were informed by police of the death.\nTheir father was a long-distance truck driver who had a close relationship with his children.\nSteven accompanied his father on long-distance trips.\nFollowing their father’s death, Suzanne was hospitalised with stomach pains and Steven suffered poor peer group relations and wore his father’s clothes, although too large for him\n\n\nBoth Gleeson CJ and Clarke JA held there was no compensable injury (nervous shock) as neither child was shown to have suffered a recognisable psychiatric illness or injury, notwithstanding their severe grief.\n\nIn dissent, Kirby P held that there was evidence of nervous shock; that it was irrelevant that the children were not involved in the direct aftermath of the accident; and it was also irrelevant that they did not have visual or aural perception of the accident.\n\n\nIn this case, the distinction drawn by the majority justices was between mere grief and extreme grief amounting to psychiatric injury\n\n\n16.6.4.2 Foreseeability that a person of ‘normal fortitude’ will suffer injury\n\nA duty of care arises only where ‘the defendant ought to have foreseen that a person of normal fortitude might, in the circumstances of the case, suffer a recognised psychiatric illness if reasonable care were not taken\n\nTame: no separate and definitive test of ‘normal fortitude’ so long as psychiatric injury is reasonably foreseeable.\n\n\nTomisevic v Menzies Wagga Southern Pty Ltd [2005] NSWCA 178\n\nheld that it was not reasonably foreseeable that a person of normal fortitude would suffer a recognisable psychiatric illness as a result of being splashed in the face by water contaminated by faeces.\n\n\nIn Optus Administration Pty Limited v Wright by his tutor James Stuart Wright [2017] NSWCA 21, the New South Wales Court of Appeal held applying s 32, that the plaintiff was not owed a duty of care because the foreseeability requirement of the section was not met.\n\nFacts\n\nThe court held that s 32 ‘applies to both pure mental harm and consequential mental harm and to harm caused directly to the plaintiff and harm caused to a third party victim which indirectly affects the plaintiff’\nThe plaintiff suffered severe post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, social phobia and depression for years following an incident while attending a training course at Optus’ premises for call centre operators who were contracted by a labour hire firm.\nAnother attendee at the training course (Mr George) who was mentally unstable and who was unknown to the plaintiff tried to kill the plaintiff by attempting to throw him off the roof of the Optus building.\n\nThe plaintiff did not know George but was asked to go to the roof by an Optus employee after a request from George.\n\n\n\n\nThe court held that the assault inflicted on the plaintiff which put his life in peril was not something which Optus ought to have foreseen or which it should reasonably have foreseen might cause a person of normal fortitude to suffer a psychiatric illness, having regard to the circumstances of the case\n\nIt was held to be implicit in s 32 that ‘the circumstances which might lead a person of normal fortitude to suffer a psychiatric illness must themselves be reasonably foreseeable’\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16.6.4.3 The circumstances of the case\n\nFor the purposes of establishing that the defendant ought to have foreseen that a person of normal fortitude would have suffered a psychiatric illness if care were not taken ([16.6.4.2]), the court must take into account the circumstances of the case.\nThe court must, in establishing reasonable foreseeability and therefore, a duty of care, have regard to the following circumstances of the case (established category pure mental harm):\n\n(a) whether or not the mental harm was suffered as a result of a sudden shock;\n(b) whether the plaintiff witnessed, at the scene, a person being killed, injured or put in danger;\n(c) the nature of the relationship between the plaintiff and anyone killed, injured or put in danger; and\n(d) whether or not there was a pre-existing relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant.\n\n\nHigh Court rejected the concept of geographical proximity and also of restricting the categories of claimant to those persons who are ‘family members’.\n\nTame, Annets\ns 32: In these jurisdictions, it is not possible to establish that the defendant has a duty of care to the plaintiff in relation to pure mental harm unless the plaintiff witnessed at the scene of an accident, the victim being killed, injured or put in peril or the plaintiff is a close member of the family of the victim\n\n\n\n\nSudden shock\n\nThe phrase ‘nervous shock’ refers to the historical legal requirement at common law that the defendant should reasonably foresee that the plaintiff will receive a shock as a result of the negligently caused events\n\nNervous shock def: ‘so distressing that the perception of the phenomenon affronts or insults the plaintiff’s mind and causes a recognisable psychiatric illness\n\n\nAt common law, however, this notion of a shock being ‘sudden’ is now supplemented by a cumulative notion of shock\n\n\nIn Gifford v Strang Patrick Stevedoring Pty Ltd (2003) 214 CLR 269, the High Court held that an employer owes a duty to take reasonable care to avoid psychiatric injury to an employee’s children.\n\nBarry Gifford had three children, Darren, Kelly and Matthew, aged 19, 17 and 14 years old, and they learnt of their father’s death later that same day.\n\nNone of them saw the deceased’s body after the accident: they were apparently discouraged from doing so because of the horrific injuries that he had suffered.\n\n\nThe High Court held that the defendant owed a duty of care to the children,\n\nPrecedent through Tame and Annetts\nthat direct perception of an incident or its aftermath is not in all cases a necessary aspect of a claim for damages for negligently inflicted psychiatric injury’\n\n\n\n\nThe High Court preferred the Oxford English Dictionary def of ‘shock’\n\nThe High Court in Wicks held that this definition of shock applied to all mentions of the word ‘shock’ in Pt 3 of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) – even though the word is used differently in various sections (ss 28, 29 and 30)\n\n\nDirect perception by the plaintiff\n\nThe requirement was extended beyond a need for the plaintiff to witness the injury, death or peril of the victim at the scene of an accident to include a plaintiff who became caught up in the immediate aftermath of the accident.\n\nIn Australia, it is generally assumed that there is no recovery for hearing bad news which occasions nervous shock; however, authority is not clear on this point\nIn Jaensch v Coffey, the High Court was divided concerning the prerequisite of damage being caused by direct perception:\n\nthat is by seeing or perceiving a shock-ing event through one’\n\n\nIn Petrie v Dowling [1992] 1 Qd R 284, a mother recovered for nervous shock when she attended a hospital and was told of her daughter’s death.\nIn Quayle v New South Wales (1995) Aust Torts Reps ¶81-367, a young Aboriginal man, who was suffering alcohol withdrawal, was transferred from the hospital to the police.\n\nHe later committed suicide at the police station. The plaintiff mother and brothers of the man recovered.\nOne brother had, after the death, been asked by police to identify the deceased’s body in the back of a police van but the other plaintiffs had not seen the deceased\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe nature of the relationship between the plaintiff and the person killed, injured or in peril\n\nThe relationship between the person who suffers pure mental harm and the person who has been physically injured, killed or put in danger as a result of the defendant’s negligence has always been relevant in determining a duty of care at common law.\nAt common law, a plaintiff will not have to be a family member of the victim to recover; no clear relational parameters which define the nature of the victim’s relationship with the person injured that would influence the imposition of a duty of care at common\n\nThe workplace provides a relationship link between plaintiff and victim which may allow a plaintiff to recover for mental harm.\nSo, in Mount Isa Mines Ltd v Pusey (1970) 125 CLR 383, the injured plaintiff was not a family member of the victims.\n\nFacts\n\nIn this case, two electricians were working on the floor above the plaintiff.\nNegligently caused a short circuit of high-powered current.\nTwo loud explosions, and an electric arc of intense heat followed.\nThe two electricians were severely burnt.\nOne died the next day and the other died eight days later.\nThe plaintiff went to the upper floor to see what had happened and helped in getting one of the electricians to the ground floor.\n\n\nthe plaintiff became depressed and he suffered a severe schizophrenic reaction acute depression and anxiety.\n\n\nHe was able to recover for nervous shock.\n\nthe case provides support for a general proposition that an employer is liable for damages in respect of nervous shock sustained by an employee at his or her place of employment in circumstances where the employer has failed to take reasonable steps to avoid a reasonably foreseeable risk of injury in that form.\n\n\n\n\nIn Page v Smith [1996] AC 155, Lord Lloyd of Berwick split the category of nervous shock victim into primary and secondary victims.\n\nHis Lordship stated that a primary victim example\n\nbystander who is narrowly missed by a negligent driver and who suffers a severe shock resulting from intense fear to his or her person and a consequential recognisable psychiatric\n\n\n‘secondary’ victim …[is] not under personal threat to his or her person and may not even observe the negligent conduct.\n\n\nsecondary victims who are caught up in the aftermath of an accident should be able to recover subject to reasonable foreseeability.\n\nMrs Coffey has been described as the secondary victim of the defendant’s negligence which caused direct injury to her husband, the primary victim.\n\n\n\n\nA pre-existing relationship between the plaintiff and defendant\n\nIn Tame v New South Wales; Annetts v Australian Stations Pty Ltd (2002) 211 CLR 317 the High Court rejected the notion that there are rigid categories of rules into which a factual situation must fit to establish a duty of care\n\nIn particular, the assurance the defendant employer gave Mr and Mrs Annetts about looking after their son, gave rise to a duty of care.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16.6.5 Reduction in damages for pure mental harm for secondary victims\n\nthe primary victim’s contributory negligence reduces the secondary victim’s damages in the same proportion as that of the primary victim.\nFurther, in New South Wales, no damages will be awarded to the plaintiff for pure mental harm if the recovery of damages from the defendant by or through the victim would be prevented by any provision of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) or any other written or unwritten law\n\n\n\n\n\n16.6.6 Consequential mental harm\n\nCourts are generally directed that in considering whether a defendant owes a plaintiff who has suffered consequential mental harm a duty of care, ‘the circumstances of the case include the personal injury suffered by the plaintiff’.\n\nthe court may only award damages for economic loss (see Chapter 22) for consequential mental harm when the harm suffered by the plaintiff is a recognised psychiatric illness.\n\n\nconsequential mental harm def\n\nFits under remoteness, first evaluate physical harm\nmental harm that is a consequence of personal injury of another kind; and\n\n\npure mental harm def\n\nmental harm other than consequential mental harm\nFits under remoteness\n\nBreach falls under the conditions of the main harm (the main plaintiff/victim) - liability for physical injury\n\n\nMust be recognised psychiatric illness\n\n\n\n\n\nOccupier’s Liability\n\nIn Australian Safeway Stores v Zaluzna (1987) 162 CLR 479 the High Court determined that an occupier’s duty is determined by ordinary common law principles, and that there was no distinction between the type of entrants as there had previously been.\n\nThe existence and scope of the duty of care will be determined by the use and nature of the occupation as well as other relevant factors - Thompson v Woolworths (Qld) Pty Ltd (2005) 221 CLR 234.\nThe duty may extend to taking reasonable care to prevent injury due to the actions of third parties, even criminal actions, but careful consideration of the elements of control and what reasonable precautions could have been taken, as well as issues of causation, will be required\n\n\n\n\n\nLeighton Contractors Pty Ltd v Fox (2009) 240 CLR 1 and Stevens v Brodribb Sawmilling Co Pty Ltd (1986) 160 CLR 16.\n\nA duty of care owed by a principal to an independent contractor may arise in circumstances where the principal retains an element of control over the contractors’s tasks, or the state of the premises on which they are to be performed.\n\nIt is not a non-delegable duty, unlike the employer’s duty to employees, and in general is less onerous.\n\n\n\n\n\nKozarov v State of Victoria\n\nBackground:\n\nThe plaintiff, Zagi Kozarov, suffered psychiatric injuries (PTSD and Major Depressive Disorder) during her employment with the Specialist Sexual Offences Unit (SSOU) of the Victorian Office of Public Prosecutions (OPP).\nShe alleged that the State of Victoria breached its duty of care by not providing a safe work environment regarding the cumulative impacts of vicarious trauma and the risks of PTSD.\n\n\nLegal Issue:\n\nWhether the State of Victoria breached its duty of care to protect Kozarov from psychiatric injury arising from her work.\n\n\nRatio:\n\nThe duty to protect employees from psychiatric injury is imposed by law and is not dependent upon any undertaking by the employer (citing Tame v New South Wales).\nThe risk of psychiatric injury must be reasonably foreseeable based on the nature and extent of the employee’s work and any signs given by the employee.\nThe existence of the Vicarious Trauma Policy demonstrated that psychiatric injury was reasonably foreseeable, and the duty of care was established.\nThe employer’s duty to ensure a safe place of work includes taking reasonable steps to prevent psychiatric injury, which may involve offering rotation to employees at risk.\n\n\nDecision:\n\nThe High Court found in favor of the plaintiff, concluding that the State of Victoria breached its duty of care to Kozarov.\nThe Court unanimously reinstated the trial judge’s conclusion that Kozarov would have cooperated if offered rotation, which would have prevented the exacerbation of her psychiatric injury.\nCausation was established, and the Court of Appeal’s decision was overturned.\n\n\nApplication:\n\nThis case sets a precedent for employers’ duty of care regarding the mental health of employees.\nIt highlights the importance of recognizing and addressing the risks of psychiatric injury in the workplace, even in the absence of evident signs.\nEmployers should take reasonable steps to prevent psychiatric harm, such as offering rotations to employees in high-risk positions.\nIt also underscores the significance of following and implementing relevant policies related to employee well-being, such as the Vicarious Trauma Policy in this case.\nThe case may have broader implications for workplace safety regulations and policies regarding psychological hazards and mental health support for employees.\n\n\n\n\n\nDhupar v Lee [2022] NSWCA 15\n\nFacts\n\nThe appellant doctor performed a tubal ligation on the respondent patient using Filshie Clips to clamp her Fallopian tubes, for permanent contraception.\n\nAbout nine months later, the patient fell pregnant. She brought an action against the doctor for alleged negligent application of the Filshie clips.\n\n\nThe Trial Judge held that the doctor had applied the left clip in the wrong location, thus failing to achieve full closure and locking of the clip.\n\nAs a result, the manner of applying the clip was not in accordance with a practice that was widely accepted by peer professional opinion as competent professional practice (section 5O Civil Liability Act 2002).\n\n\nThe doctor’s inherent risk (section 5I Civil Liability Act 2002) defence failed.\n\n\nThe decision on appeal\n\nThe doctor appealed the decision on both liability and damages.\n\nIt was not disputed that pregnancy can occur after tubal ligation without negligence.\n\nHowever, with regard to liability, the Court of Appeal considered that there was error in the way the left Filshie clip was applied to the Fallopian tube, resulting in incomplete closure.\n\n\nAs such, the Court of Appeal affirmed the District Court decision concerning liability.\n\n\nRegarding damages, there was no challenge on appeal of the Trial Judge’s findings that the patient developed psychiatric injury following the birth of the child, nor that the patient suffered loss of earning and loss of earning capacity due to that injury.\nSection 71 of the Civil Liability Act 2002 provides that in any claim involving the birth of a child, the Court cannot award damages for economic loss associated with the cost of rearing or maintaining the child, including loss of earnings incurred by a plaintiff while rearing or maintaining the child.\n\nSection 71 does not prevent recovering damages for additional costs of rearing or maintaining because of a disability suffered by the child, although this was not relevant in this case.\n\n\nThe Trial Judge took the view that section 71 does not preclude an award for damages for loss of earnings arising from psychiatric injury associated with the birth of a child.\n\nThe mother was awarded damages for lost earnings due to her psychiatric injury.\n\n\nThe Court of Appeal agreed, and also affirmed the decision of the District Court on damages.\n\n\nFinal comment\n\nIn a wrongful birth claim, it is necessary to distinguish between economic losses arising from the ordinary costs of child rearing and maintenance, for which no damages are available, and losses consequent upon some other cause.\nThe decision in Dhupar v Lee [2022] NSWCA 15 illustrates that damages are available for economic loss arising from an injury suffered by the mother as a result of the birth.\n\nSection 71 of the Civil Liability Act 2002 does not preclude recovering economic loss for psychiatric injury (and arguably any other physical injury to the parent) caused by the birth of the child.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Is ‘Nervous Shock’ Still a Feminist Issue? The Duty of Care and Psychiatric Injury in Australia” can be updated as follows:\n\nBackground:\n\nThe action for negligently caused ‘nervous shock’ or psychiatric harm has been available for over 100 years, but has been problematic due to extra hurdles imposed for proving a duty of care in such cases.\nThe feminist analysis has been crucial in illuminating this issue.\n\n\nLegal Issue:\n\nThe article examines changes in the law, particularly following the High Court’s decisions in Tame v NSW; Annetts v Australian Stations Pty Ltd [2002] HCA 35; (2002) 211 CLR 317, to determine whether the feminist critique on the treatment of psychiatric harm is still relevant.\n\n\nRatio:\n\nDespite the ‘mainstreaming’ of claims for nervous shock following the High Court’s decisions in 2002, the article argues that the distinctions that remain, or have been reinstated, stem from the history of nervous shock claims traditionally being associated with women.\n\n\nDecision:\n\nThe High Court in 2002 sought to equalize the treatment of nervous shock cases with other personal injury cases by emphasizing that psychiatric injuries are as real as physical injuries.\nHowever, subsequent legislative changes through various Civil Liability Acts have reverted or altered the legal standing of psychiatric harm, questioning the enduring relevance of feminist critiques.\n\n\nApplication:\n\nThrough a comprehensive analysis spanning cases from 1885 to 2008, and revisiting feminist theory, the article underscores that the gendered way of thinking still affects how psychiatric harm is regarded in legal settings in Australia, thereby emphasizing that the feminist critique remains pertinent in understanding and addressing the disparities in legal treatment of psychiatric injuries.\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn XXIII College v SMA [2022] ACTCA 32\n\nBackground:\n\nSMA, a former student of the Australian National University, attended a social event named “Pub Golf” at John XXIII College in 2015.\nDuring the event, she was sexually assaulted by another College resident.\nThe event had participants moving to different venues in Canberra, consuming alcohol at each.\n\n\nLegal Issue:\n\nWhether John XXIII College breached its duty of care towards SMA during the event and in the handling of her subsequent complaint.\n\n\nRatio:\n\nEducational institutions have a responsibility to ensure the safety of their students during organized events.\nProper handling and investigation of student complaints, especially of serious nature, are essential.\n\n\nDecision:\n\nThe original Supreme Court ruled in favor of SMA, awarding her $420,201.57 in damages.\nUpon appeal, the Court of Appeal upheld the breach of duty findings but adjusted the damages for past and future economic loss, reducing the award to $267,500.\n\n\nApplication:\n\nThe original court found that the College was negligent both in its handling of the event and in managing SMA’s complaint post-assault.\nThe appeal focused on the accuracy of these findings and the calculation of damages.\nDespite the reduced damages on appeal, the decision emphasizes the accountability of Australian universities concerning the safety and well-being of their students.\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 11: CH 17 - Negligently Caused Pure Economic Loss\n\n\n‘Pure’ Economic Loss\n\n‘Pure’ Economic Loss def\n\narises where the plaintiff has suffered economic loss which is not consequent upon any physical injury to person or property.\nAn example would be where a plaintiff loses an investment because of negligent financial advice\n\n\nEconomic loss due to physical harm examples\n\nWage loss, both past and future, medical and other care expenses and the like are common types of economic loss for which damages are routinely awarded to plaintiffs in cases of negligently caused physical harm\n\n\nThe ‘economic torts’\n\nIntentional conduct causing economic loss\nand negligent conduct or words causing economic loss.\n\nnegligently caused pure economic loss\nThat reasonable foreseeability of the economic loss is not, on its own, a sufficient reason to impose a duty of care.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy considerations\n\nIndeterminate liability\n\nfear of ‘indeterminate liability def’\n\nif a duty of care to avoid pure economic loss is imposed, in many instances the effect would be to make a defendant’s liability incalculable.\nhow many potential plaintiffs it might be liable or for what quantum of damages?\nEx: When a company is found to be worth less than indicated by the accounts or when it goes into liquidation, will the auditors be liable to all those persons who used the accounts to make investment or financial decisions and who have lost money as a result?\n\n\n\n\nThe relationship between tort and contract\n\nthe law of contract has historically been concerned with the recovery of purely financial losses.\nThe law of contract has developed its own rules to regulate rights, such as the doctrine of privity, the need for consideration and an intention to enter into contractual relations.\nIn many cases of pure economic loss, there will be a contractual relationship between the parties themselves\n\nWill try for contract law first before before purely financial losses.\n\n\n\n\nNo liability in tort for otherwise lawful commercial activity\n\nThe concern to ensure that tort law does not stifle legitimate commercial activity\nPerre v Apand Pty Ltd (1999) 198 CLR 18\n\nevaluates the duty not to cause pure economic loss\nIn that case, however, the court determined that the imposition of a duty would not offend this policy consideration because the defendant’s conduct was unlawful and against even its own commercial interests and therefore the imposition of a duty would not stifle competitive commercial activity\n\n\n\n\nThe ‘no-recovery’ rule in England\n\nHistorically, the courts dealt with the policy problems associated with the imposition of a duty to avoid purely economic loss by simply refusing to allow recovery at all.\n\nIn Derry v Peek (1889) 14 App Cas 337, the House of Lords refused to allow recovery in the tort of deceit, for pure economic loss against the promoters of a company, in respect of a negligent statement in a prospectus.\nWeller v Foot &amp; Mouth Disease Research Institute [1966] 1 QB 569, the court refused to allow recovery to the plaintiff firm of cattle auctioneers who suffered financial loss when the sale yards were closed following an outbreak of foot and mouth disease negligently allowed to escape from the defendant’s research facility.\n\n\nThe English courts generally maintain this ‘no recovery’ rule in respect of negligent acts causing purely economic loss\nSince the decision in Caltex Oil (Australia) Pty Ltd v Dredge ‘Willemstad’ (1976) 136 CLR 529, the Australian High Court has taken a very different approach to that of the English courts in cases of negligent acts causing purely economic loss.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Difference Between Negligent Acts and Negligent Statements causing Economic Loss\n\n\nHedley Byrne &amp; Co Ltd v Heller &amp; Partners Ltd [1964] AC 465\n\nthe decision in Hedley Byrne allowed for a duty of care in limited cases of negligent misstatement\nHouse of Lords recognised that the negligent making of a statement causing economic loss would, in limited circumstances, give rise to a duty of care\n\n\n\nIn Australia, the distinction between ‘statements’ and ‘acts’ is relevant because some different salient features may influence the imposition of a duty of care, depending on whether the case is one concerning a negligent statement or a negligent act by the defendant, causing financial loss, though there is overlap\n\n\n17.5 Negligent Misstatements\n\nHedley Byrne v Heller,\n\nThere was no comprehensive test laid down to establish a duty of care for negligent misstatement.\n\nNegligent misstatement def\n\nrelates to a representation of fact, which is carelessly made, and is relied on by another party to their disadvantage\n\n\n\n\nInstead, the court identified relevant factors such as the ‘skill and judgment’ of the person making the statement and the nature of reliance by the plaintiff upon it.\nIt was only the disclaimer of liability which prevented the court from imposing a duty of care on the defendants in Hedley Byrne v Heller\n\n\nSalient features and vulnerability\n\nThe main factors identified in Hedley Byrne, namely,\n\n(1) the knowledge of the defendant, actual or attributed, that the plaintiff is likely to rely on the information and\n(2) reasonable reliance by the plaintiff on the information, are common to all cases.\n\n\nIn Woolcock Street Investments Pty Ltd v CDG Pty Ltd (2004) 216 CLR 515, McHugh J held that vulnerability def means ‘that by reason of ignorance or social, political or economic constraints, the plaintiff was not able to protect him or herself from the risk of injury’ ([80]).\nIn Middleton v Aon Risk Services Aust Ltd [2008] WASCA 239 (a case about a negligent misrepresentation), McLure JA (Buss JA and Murray AJA agreeing) explained the place of vulnerability as a feature of the duty of care in negligent misstatement cases\n\n\nSpecial skill\n\nThe Hedley Byrne v Heller approach to the duty of care in negligent misstatement cases was approved and applied by the High Court of Australia in\nMLC Assurance Co Ltd v Evatt (1969) 122 CLR 556\n\nBackground\n\nIn that case, the plaintiff was a policy holder with the defendant insurance company.\nHe sought investment information and advice from the insurance company regarding investment in a company, HG Palmer Ltd.\nHG Palmer Ltd soon went into liquidation and the plaintiff lost his investment.\nThe plaintiff claimed that MLC owed him a duty of care, which had been breached.\n\nThe defendant argued that the plaintiff’s pleading was bad because it did not disclose all the elements of a duty as set forth in the Hedley Byrne case\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Issue\n\nWas it reasonable for the plaintiff to rely on the advice from MLC when it was not an investment adviser and did not have any ‘special skill’ in this field.\n\n\nHeld\n\nThe High Court held that MLC did owe the plaintiff a duty of care.\n\nTo establish the duty the plaintiff must establish that, in the circumstances, it was reasonable for the plaintiff to have relied on the information provided by the defendant.\n\n\nThe High Court held that having a ‘special skill’ was not a prerequisite to the imposition of a duty of care.\n\nThe speaker must realise or the circumstances be such that he ought to have realised that the recipient intends to act on the information or advice\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis adoption of the Barwick CJ approach was confirmed in L Shaddock &amp; Associates Pty Ltd v Parramatta City Council (1981) 150 CLR 225\n\nwhere property developers had purchased property within the Parramatta area and their solicitor made first a telephone inquiry, and then a written inquiry asking the council whether the property was affected by any road-widening proposals.\nBackground\n\nIt was the usual practice of the council to make such disclosures on the certificates it issued in response to requests by intending purchasers.\nThe property was, in fact, the subject of road-widening plans by the council and the plaintiffs claimed they suffered financial loss as a result of the council’s negligent failure to disclose the information.\n\n\nHeld\n\nThe High Court upheld an appeal by the plaintiffs, unanimously finding that the council owed them a duty to take reasonable care in the giving of information\n\nthe council’s adoption of the practice of giving out information when requested to do so, was no different from the situation where a person is carrying on the business of supplying information or giving advice\nwhilst it was reasonable for the plaintiff to rely on the written certificate issued by the council which did not disclose any road-widening proposal, it would not have been reasonable to rely on advice which was given over the phone to the plaintiff’s solicitor by an unidentified council employee because of the informality of such oral advice.\n\n\nMason and Aickin JJ, held that the Privy Council decision in MLC v Evatt should not be followed in Australia.\n\n\n\n\nSo, in Australia, it is not a prerequisite to the duty of care that the defendant be ‘in the business’ of giving information or advice.\n\n\nReasonable reliance\n\nAs MLC v Evatt demonstrates, two factors essential for the imposition of a duty of care in negligent misstatement cases are\n\nthe reasonable reliance by the plaintiff on the information or advice provided by the defendant and\nthe defendant’s knowledge that the plaintiff will rely on it.\n\n\nTepko Pty Ltd v Water Board (2001) 206 CLR\n\nBackground\n\nplaintiff companies, which were owned and controlled by Mr Neal (in a case in which the facts were very convoluted), were the owners of semi-rural land on the fringe of Sydney.\nThey were seeking to have the land rezoned and then subdivided for sale as suburban housing lots.\nOne of the conditions of the subdivision was that the plaintiffs would finance the connection of the land to water and sewerage.\nThe plaintiffs sought an estimate of the cost of such connection from the Water Board.\n\n\nbank decided that the development was untenable and required repayment of its loan.\nThe land was sold for a much smaller sum than it would have been worth had it been subdivided.\n\nIt was later discovered that the Water Board’s estimate had been greatly overstated.\n\n\nIssue\n\nThe plaintiffs claimed that the Water Board owed them a duty to take care in the preparation of the estimate so as not to cause them financial loss.\n\n\nHeld\n\nThe High Court, by a majority of 4 to 3, held that the defendant did not owe a duty of care to the plaintiff because it was unreasonable for the plaintiffs to have relied on the estimate, in all the circumstances.\n\n\nRatio\n\nThe court noted that the figure given was at best, a ‘ballpark’ figure, that it had been provided reluctantly by the Water Board only after much lobbying by the plaintiffs; that the plaintiffs had access to other expert advice;\nand that the Water Board was unaware that the figure was required for the plaintiff’s bank.\n\n\n\n\nRoo Roofing Pty Ltd v Commonwealth [2019] VSC 33,\n\na class action brought by business owners and installers of home insulation\nThe plaintiffs claimed economic losses arising out of the Home Insulation Program (HIP) that was part of the fiscal stimulus program implemented by the Australian Government in 2009, in response to the Global Financial Crisis.\n\nWhen the government ended the program early and without notice in 2010, the plaintiffs who had ‘geared up’ their businesses to take advantage of the (heavily government subsidised) demand for home insulation, claimed that the Commonwealth was responsible for their subsequent economic losses.\n\n\nthe Commonwealth did not induce the plaintiffs to take part in the HIP – it encouraged participation but the plaintiffs made their own business decisions\n\n\n\n\nDefendant’s knowledge/request for information\n\nThe courts will not impose a duty of care in circumstances where the defendant does not know or could not have known that the plaintiff (or a class of vulnerable persons of which the plaintiff is one) would receive and rely on the information or advice given.\nIn San Sebastian Pty Ltd v The Minister (1986) 162 CLR 340, the plaintiff, a property developer, relied on plans for the redevelopment of Woolloomooloo in Sydney.\n\nThe plaintiff property developer purchased property in the area and lost money when the council and the planning authority decided not to proceed with the redevelopment.\n\nThe plaintiff claimed that the council and the authority were negligent in preparing and publishing a plan which they might not proceed with\n\n\nThe High Court held that in the circumstances it was not reasonable for the plaintiff to have relied on the published plan because it contained no feasibility statement as to whether it was capable of being implemented and the defendants had made no statement as to whether the plan would in fact proceed.\nThe court also considered to be relevant to the duty question the fact that the plaintiff had made no request to the defendant for the information.\n\nthere is a requirement that the defendant makes the statement with the intention of inducing the plaintiff (or members of the class) to rely on it.\n\n\n\n\nIn Corkhill v Commonwealth (No 3) [2018] ACTSC 87, the plaintiff was unsuccessful in her claim in respect of incorrect advice given to her husband by Commonwealth employees (many years before his death), that he was ineligible to join the Commonwealth superannuation scheme.\n\nThe court held that the ‘actual representor’ (the maker of the statement) would have to have known that the deceased was married when the advice was given and that the advice would be communicated to his wife and that she would rely on it.\nThe court also held that the deceased was not vulnerable and nor was the plaintiff because they had the means to check the accuracy of the advice\n\n\nIn Central Highlands Regional Council v Geju Pty Ltd [2018] QCA 38, the council had issued a limited planning and development certificate to the owner of land who subsequently sold the land to the plaintiff (respondent to the appeal).\n\nThe certificate incorrectly stated the land was zoned industrial when in fact it was zoned rural.\nThe plaintiff relied on the certificate when it purchased the property four months later.\nHeld\n\nThe court held that the evidence did not justify a finding that the respondent (plaintiff): … was a member of an identified class to whom it was likely that the certificate would come and that the certificate would be very likely to lead it to enter into a transaction of the kind it did enter into.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuditors\n\nIn Esanda Finance Corp Ltd v Peat Marwick Hungerfords (1997) 188 CLR 241,\n\nthe High Court again considered a case where the plaintiff did not request the information from the defendant and where the defendant could not have known that the plaintiff was relying on the information until after the event.\nFacts\n\nIn Esanda, the plaintiff was a finance company who loaned funds to a company, Excel, relying on the accounts of Excel audited by the defendants.\nThe plaintiff did not obtain the accounts from the auditors\nExcel failed to repay the debt to the plaintiff.\nThe plaintiff alleged that the auditors had negligently prepared the accounts on which the plaintiff relied as to the financial viability of Excel, thus contributing to the plaintiff’s loss\n\n\nHeld\n\nThe judgments in the case do not supply a definitive answer to the question of which factors are essential to a duty but they do indicate that the court would be very reluctant to impose a duty of care upon auditors in this kind of case, where a third party relies on the accounts, unknown to the auditors\nthe information would have to be given to the plaintiff (individually or as a member of an ascertained class) for a purpose that would be likely to lead the plaintiff into a transaction and that it would be very likely that the plaintiff would rely on the information in entering into the\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProportionate liability under civil liability legislation\n\nAll Australian jurisdictions have introduced a proportionate liability regime with respect to liability for damage between concurrent tortfeasors in cases of purely economic loss or property damage\n\nCommon Law v Statute\n\nSo, a defendant who has a relatively small part in causing the plaintiff’s loss would be liable for damages only in proportion to the level of its culpability, rather than, as is the case at common law, for all of the plaintiff’s loss, subject to any contribution that might be recovered from other concurrent wrongdoers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimers\n\nIn Hedley Byrne, even though a duty of care was established, the defendants were not liable because of the inclusion of a disclaimer on the credit reference letter from the bank to the advertising agents.\n\n\nAustralian statutory causes of action for negligent Misstatements\n\ns 18 of the Australian Consumer Law, provides a statutory remedy for financial loss in many instances of negligent misstatement\nThe causes of action provided by these statutory provisions are much easier for a plaintiff to prove than a claim in negligence because there is no need to establish a duty of care on common law principles or breach of duty.\n\nThe plaintiff simply has to prove a breach of the section: that is, that the defendant’s conduct was misleading or deceptive and that it caused the plaintiff’s loss.\n\n\nIn cases against government authorities or local councils for example, plaintiffs rely on the common law because the statutory authorities are not engaged in trade or commerce:\n\nfor example, Tepko Pty Ltd v Water Board (2001) 206 CLR 1\n\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs successfully relied on statutory causes of action as well as common law claims in some cases arising out of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC).\n\nThe Full Federal Court decision in ABN Amro Bank NV v Bathurst Regional Council (2014) 224 FCR 1, illustrates the complexity of litigation in pure economic loss cases where several statutory and common law causes of action are relied upon.\n\nThe case involved claims by 13 local government councils against various defendants including the ratings agency Standard and Poor’s (S&amp;P), in respect of a report published by S&amp;P concerning an investment ‘product’ known as Rembrandt Notes which S&amp;P had given a ‘AAA Credit Rating\n\n\nThe court held S&amp;P liable under both statutory and common law causes of action.\n\nWith respect to the common law claim, the court held that S&amp;P had made a negligent misstatement as to the credit rating of the investments.\n\nFurther the court held that the disclaimers made by S&amp;P were not effective (being inexplicit and not sufficiently targeted at potential investors) and that causation was proven as the GFC did not cause the losses suffered by investors, rather they were caused by the negligent misstatements of S&amp;P\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatutory limitation of liability in Australia\n\nIn Australian States and Territories, it is now possible for members of some professions to limit their liability (other than for death or personal injury) to the extent of their professional indemnity insurance, or their net commercial assets,or by reference to fees charged for the work which attracts liability.\n\n\nStatutes of limitation\n\nIn Commonwealth v Cornwell (2007) 229 CLR 519, the High Court was asked to determine the operation of s 11 of the Limitation Act 1985 (ACT) as to whether the action in negligence was commenced after the expiration of a period of six years running from the date on which that cause of action had ‘first accrue[d]’\n\nIn a joint judgment the High Court (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne, Heydon and Crennan JJ) held that the statutory limitation period started to run upon his retirement when actual financial damage was suffered so that the cause of action was only then complete\n\nThe applicant alleged that he had been given negligent advice by his employment supervisor in 1965 about his inability to join a government superannuation fund, which advice he reasonably relied upon.\nHe argued that he suffered economic loss because his retirement benefit was worth less than it otherwise would have been.\n\n\nIt did not accrue at the time the negligent advice was given, nor some years later when the plaintiff missed an opportunity to join the fund.\n\nThe applicant could therefore recover damages as his claim was not statute-barred.\n\n\n\n\nneed for precision in characterising the nature of the loss claimed by the plaintiff and of pinpointing the time at which the loss was suffered because only when actual damage accrues is the tort of negligence complete.\n\n\n\n\n\n17.6 Negligent Acts ausing Pure Economic Loss\n\n\nIn Australia cases of economic loss caused by negligent acts are different from that in cases of negligent misstatement.\n\nthe duty is controlled by the salient features developed by the courts.\n\n\n\nThe Caltex case\n\nThe landmark case in Australia in this area is Caltex Oil (Australia) Pty Ltd v Dredge ‘Willemstad’ (1976) 136 CLR 52\n\nBackground:\n\nThe defendant damaged an oil pipeline that Caltex depended on for its operations.\n\n\nLegal Issue:\n\nWhether a duty of care is owed for pure economic loss.\n\n\nRatio:\n\nDuty of care can be owed in exceptional cases when a specific individual, not just a class of people, is likely to suffer economic loss due to the defendant’s negligence.\n\n\nDecision:\n\nThe High Court ruled in favor of Caltex, establishing that in some circumstances, a duty of care for pure economic loss exists.\n\n\nApplication:\n\nSubsequent cases argued on Caltex principles were mostly unsuccessful, as plaintiffs struggled to prove they were part of an “ascertained class” known to suffer economic loss from the defendant’s actions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Bryan v Maloney (1995) 182 CLR 609,\n\nBackground\n\nThe defendant was the builder of a house that had been purchased by the plaintiff some seven years after its construction.\nThe plaintiff was the third owner of the house. Some months after the plaintiff bought the house, it was discovered that the foundations were inadequate and the walls were cracking.\nThe plaintiff’s damage was characterised as pure economic loss because the builder had not damaged the house.\nRather, the builder had built a defective house causing a diminution in its value.\n\n\nthe High Court imposed a duty of care on the builder to the plaintiff, a subsequent purchaser of the house with whom there had never been any contractual relationship.\n\nto impose a duty would not create indeterminate liability; that the purchase of a home is often the most important financial transaction a person will make in a lifetime; and that the builder was in a better position to avoid the risk than the plaintiff.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Hawkins v Clayton (1988) 164 CLR 539, the defendants were a firm of solicitors who had prepared a will and kept it in safe custody for their client, who subsequently died.\n\nBackground\n\nThe plaintiff was the executor and residuary beneficiary under the will.\nThe firm of solicitors failed to notify the plaintiff of the existence of the will following the death of their client, even though they could easily have traced the plaintiff through the Sydney telephone directory.\nThe principal asset of the estate, a house, fell into disrepair during the six years that the estate was neglected.\nWhen the plaintiff was eventually informed of the existence and whereabouts of the will, there was a substantial death duty penalty and other economic losses to the estate and the plaintiff.\n\n\nThe High Court imposed a duty of care upon the solicitors to the executor/beneficiary of their client’s estate and Deane J held that, in economic loss cases, the relationship of proximity is characterised by ‘some additional element or elements which will commonly (but not necessarily) consist of known reliance (or dependence) or the assumption of responsibility or a combination of the two’.\n\n\n\nHill v Van Erp (1997) 188 CLR 159\r\n- Background\n\nthe plaintiff was a beneficiary under a will which was drawn, and the execution of which was supervised by, the defendant, a solicitor.\nBecause the defendant allowed the will to be witnessed by the spouse of the plaintiff beneficiary, the gift of a house to that beneficiary failed (under the rules of succession law).\nThe disappointed beneficiary sued the solicitor claiming that the solicitor owed a duty of care to avoid pure economic loss to her\r\n- Held\nThe beneficiary was not the solicitor’s client.\nThe court held that while, generally, a solicitor does not owe a duty of care to a person other than the client, in this case a duty should be imposed because the solicitor, in accepting instructions to draw and supervise the execution of the will, had assumed responsibility to her client and to the intended beneficiary\n\n\n\nThe Perre case: a new approach\n\nPerre v Apand Pty Ltd (1999) 198 CLR 180\nRecovery of pure economic loss caused by a negligent act\nThe decision in Perre adopted what has become known as the ‘salient features’ approach to the duty of care question and the High Court identified several salient features relevant in cases of purely economic loss.\nBackground\n\nThe plaintiffs in Perre were several related parties who owned potato farms in South Australia, and grew, washed, packed and sold potatoes.\nThe plaintiffs sold their potato crops into Western Australia, as did many of the other South Australian producers.\nThe defendant was a large manufacturer of potato crisps and supplied potato seed to one of its growers who had a farm in the vicinity of the plaintiff’s farm.\nSome of the seed grown by the plaintiffs’ neighbours was diseased, because the defendant had negligently supplied uncertified experimental seed.\nWestern Australian regulations prohibited the import into that State of potatoes grown or processed within a 20-kilometre radius of an outbreak of the disease.\nAccordingly, the plaintiffs were unable to sell their crops for at least five years into Western Australia, which was a more lucrative market than others available.\nThe plaintiffs’ crop was not affected by the disease.\nIt was undamaged and quite healthy, but the plaintiffs suffered economic loss as a result of being unable to ‘export’ their crop to Western Australia.\nThe plaintiffs claimed that the defendant owed them a duty of care to avoid this economic loss.\n\n\nThe High Court imposed a duty of care on the defendants, though each of the seven justices delivered a separate judgment and emphasised different considerations on the duty of care question.\n\nThe major policy considerations in this type of case are the need to avoid indeterminate liability and the need to avoid making otherwise legitimate ordinary commercial activity tortious. Neither of these issues was problematic in the present case.\nThe plaintiffs in this case were particularly vulnerable as they could not have done anything to protect themselves from the defendant’s actions.\nIndeed, they did not even know of the supply of the infected seed.\n\n\nIndicia of DUTY to avoid Pure Economic Loss (PEL) from Perre\n\nReasonable foreseebility of loss\nAvoid indeterminate liability\nAllow autonomy to pursue legitimate business interests\nVulnerability of plaintiff\nKnowledge &amp; control of defendant\n\n\n\n\n\nNegligent Mistatement\n\nSpecial knowledge/skill?\n\nreasonable reliance by P\n\n\nKnowledge of defendant that P will rely\n\n\n\nDansar Pty Ltd v Byron Shire Council [2014] NSWCA 36\n\nBackground\n\nthe council was held not to owe a duty of care to a developer.\nIn 1997, the council resolved to limit new development in the Byron Bay area because of sewerage treatment plant limitations.\nIn 2001, Dansar lodged a development application which was refused due to council error – there was sewerage capacity at that time.\nHowever, when the application was relodged in 2005 there was no sewerage capacity.\nDansar sued the council for the economic loss as a result of the first negligent refusal of the development application.\n\n\nHeld\n\nthat there was no reliance on the council by the developer nor any assumption of responsibility by the council ([171]-[176]) because at no time was the appellant/developer relying on any express or implied assurance from the council that it would allocate available capacity in a particular way and exercise reasonable care in doing so.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Woolcock case: salient features and vulnerability\n\nWoolcock Street Investments Pty Ltd v CDG Pty Ltd (2004) 216 CLR 515\n\nAnother duty of care to avoid purely economic loss case\nBackground\n\nthe court held that a firm of consulting engineers who had advised the original owners and builders of a commercial building did not owe a duty of care to subsequent purchasers of the building who discovered some years after its completion that the foundations were structurally unsound.\n\n\nAppellate court\n\nThe builders and designers of commercial buildings did not owe any duty of care to avoid pure economic loss to remote purchasers.\nThe Court of Appeal held that the decision in Bryan v Maloney applied only to domestic dwellings and could not be relied upon as authority for the imposition of a duty in respect of commercial buildings\nIn the Woolcock Street Investments case, the defendants did not owe the original owners a duty of the kind claimed by the plaintiffs because the defendants had advised the original owners to carry out geotechnical investigations and the owners had refused to do so.\n\n\nHCA Held\n\nThe High Court took the view that the point of difference between the two cases was not simply the domestic/commercial premises issue which was not the decisive factor on the duty question.\nthe plaintiffs were not vulnerable to the economic consequences of any failure on the defendants’ part.\n\nThe plaintiffs, as sophisticated commercial investors, could have protected themselves against loss arising from defects in the building by requiring contractual warranties from the vendor, or by carrying out their own investigations into the structural soundness of the building before purchase.\n\n\nUsed the phrase indicia of a duty to prevent pure economic loss\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Barclay v Penberthy (2012) 246 CLR 258, the High Court applied the principle of vulnerability developed in Woolcock to a claim against the pilot of a commercial aircraft\n\nThe claim was for economic loss suffered by an employer because of injuries to three of its employees and the deaths of two other employees in an aircraft crash.\nThe claim in respect of the deceased employees failed because of the rule in Baker v Bolton (1808) 1 Camp 493; 170 ER 1033 that the death of a human being does not enable a claim by someone else at common law\nThe High Court held that the pilot (Penberthy) owed the plaintiff a duty of care in negligence in respect of the injuries to its surviving employees\n\n\n\nThe New South Wales Court of Appeal considered the nature of vulnerability in Western Districts Developments Pty Ltd and Turnpike Lane Pty Ltd v Baulkham Hills Shire Council [2009] NSWCA 283\n\nThe council had erroneously issued a subdivision certificate containing an incorrect endorsement that water and sewerage construction costs had been paid in respect of land subsequently purchased by the plaintiff.\nIt later had to make the substantial payment to the water authority.\nPreston CJ of the Land and Environment Court with whom Campbell and Giles JJA agreed, referred ([73]) to the ‘five principles’ identified by McHugh J in Perre and held that the plaintiffs were vulnerable (\n\n\n\nThe New South Wales Court of Appeal in Reynolds v Katoomba RSL All Services Club Ltd (2001) 53 NSWLR 43,\n\nrefused to impose a duty of care on the club which allowed the plaintiff to gamble and continued to allow him to obtain cash at the club, when its employees knew of his difficulties\n\n\n\nThe ‘salient features’ approach\n\nIn Makawe Pty Ltd v Randwick City Council (2009) 171 LGERA 165, Simpson JA in the New South Wales Court of Appeal considered how the ‘salient features test’ might be applied\n\nHer Honour’s suggestion is that the fact that a plaintiff’s loss is purely economic loss should be but one feature which the court will consider on the duty question:\nthat there is no ‘special’ test for duty in these cases but rather that they should be decided on ordinary duty principles having regard to applicable ‘salient features’.\n\n\nThe application of the ‘salient features’ approach is demonstrated in Dale v Veda Advantage Information Services and Solutions Ltd (2009) 176 FCR 456\n\nthe Federal Court considered nine claims in respect of pure economic loss as a result of erroneous information about the plaintiffs that was included in the defendant’s electronic credit reporting database.\nThe plaintiffs sued in the torts of defamation and negligence.\n\nIn a complex and lengthy judgment dealing with the significant statutory overlay of the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), Lindgren J found against the plaintiffs on the defamation claims on the basis of the defence of qualified privilege\n\n\nThe court further held that the defendant had not assumed any responsibility to the plaintiffs and that the plaintiffs were not vulnerable because of rights given to them under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth):\n\n\nMarsh v Baxter [2015] WASCA 169,\n\nthe Western Australian Supreme Court of Appeal considered a ‘novel’ pure economic loss claim which arose from the accidental windborne dispersal of genetically modified canola from the defendants’ property onto the appellants’ certified organic farm.\nHeld\n\nThe majority distinguished Marsh v Baxter from Perre v Apand as in their view, the appellants could (unlike the plaintiffs in Perre) appreciate the risk to which they were exposed and may have protected themselves by erecting barriers to prevent the GM modified produce being blown on their farm\n\n\n\n\nIn RinRim Pty ltd v Deutsche Bank AG [2017] NSWCA 169, vulnerability was again a crucial consideration on the duty question ([133]).\n\nBackground\n\nThere the plaintiff claimed that it suffered financial loss when bankers and underwriters failed to take reasonable steps to ascertain that it was entitled to participate in the institutional first stage of a share entitlement offer for a company in which it was a shareholder.\n\n\nThe Court of Appeal held that any loss suffered by the plaintiff was not caused by the defendants’ actions\n\nApplying the salient features approach, the court addressed several matters, most significantly the lack of vulnerability of the plaintiff and held that there was no duty of care\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Action for Negligently caused Pure Economic Loss and Defective Structures\n\nOne particular action may be in respect of defective structures, where the plaintiff claims that a building has been negligently planned, engineered, designed or built.\nDefective structures\n\nThere are two distinctly separate types of claims that may arise from defective structures:\n\n(a) For personal injury: Australian courts have held that a person who suffers personal injury, as a result of defective design or building work, is owed a duty of care by the person responsible for the defect: Voli v Inglewood Shire Council (1963) 110 CLR 74.\n\n\nAnd: (b) For purely economic loss: where the plaintiff’s loss is financial.\n\nIn such cases, it is the defective nature of the building which is the damage suffered by the plaintiff: a diminution in its value.\nThe quantum of the plaintiff’s loss is the cost of rectification.\n\n\nEven as to purchasers of domestic homes, the requirement for vulnerability in the Woolcock sense, will result in the failure of many claims: see, for example, Ku-ring-gai Council v Chan [2017] NSWCA 22\n\n\nBuilders\n\nIn Bryan v Maloney (1995) 182 CLR 609, the High Court held that a builder owed a duty to a subsequent purchaser to take reasonable care in the building of a house.\nBryan v Maloney established a broader common law liability for building professionals than previously existed\nIn establishing a duty of care to avoid pure economic loss between builders and subsequent purchasers, the court extended the traditional concept of liability for economic loss caused by a defective structure.\nBrookfield Multiplex Ltd v Owners Corporation Strata Plan 61288 (2014) 254 CLR 185 is the most recent High Court case to confine the impact of Bryan v Maloney.\n\nthe opportunity for recovery by plaintiffs on Bryan v Maloney principles is now severely limited by the increasing emphasis on the requirement for vulnerability in the Woolcock and Brookfield cases\n\n\n\n\nCommercial developers and design and construction contractors\n\nIn Brookfield Multiplex Ltd v Owners Corporation Strata Plan 61288 (2014) 254 CLR 185\n\nthe High Court held that the contractor/builder under a ‘design and construct contract’ for a high-rise building did not owe a duty of care to avoid pure economic loss occasioned by latent defects, to the owners’ corporation or to individual apartment owners in the strata title scheme.\n\nFrench CJ described the relationship between Brookfield and the owners’ corporation as ‘analogous, although not identical, to the position of the purchaser of the complex in Woolcock\n\n\nBrookfield did not owe a duty of care to avoid pure economic loss to Chelsea (the original developer and principal under the contract with Brookfield) or to the subsequent purchasers of lots in the strata plan or to the strata owners corporation.\nBackground\n\nThe case concerned a large commercial strata scheme.\nThe builder Brookfield Multiplex Ltd and the property developer, Chelsea Apartments Pty Ltd were parties to a design and construct contract for a $57 million, 22 storey mixed use apartment hotel complex.\nOn completion, a strata plan was registered, and the respondent, Owners Corporation Strata Plan 61288, came into existence and the common property was vested in it.\nThe lots in the apartment complex were then sold to investors.\nThe pure economic loss claim arose from latent defects in the building, which emerged after the expiration of the 12-month defect liability period stipulated in the design and construct contract\n\n\nHeld\n\nThe High Court held that neither Chelsea, the apartment owners nor the Owners Corporation were vulnerable in the Woolcock sense to suffering loss caused by the latent defects.\nThe vulnerability of the plaintiffs was the paramount consideration in determining the duty of care for pure economic loss\n\nThe duties concerning defective works were governed by the terms of the contractual arrangements\nThe court concluded that the parties had turned their minds to the issues and consciously and deliberately

duty of care on persons who carry out construction work, to exercise reasonable care to avoid economic loss caused to owners by building defects\nThe statutory duty of care does not extend to owners who are developers or large commercial entities.\n\n\n\n\nArchitects\n\nSince the decision of the High Court in Voli v Inglewood Shire Council (1963) 110 CLR 74, it is clear that architects may be liable in tort for building defects for which they are responsible\nBackground\n\nIn this case, Mr Voli was injured when a stage on which he was standing while waiting to cast a vote at a meeting, collapsed injuring around 50 people.\nthe joists were not sufficient to carry the weight of the people on the stage, a number considered reasonable given the entertainment purposes for which the stage was built.\n\n\nHeld\n\nThe architect had submitted his plans to the council’s Public Works Department where no objection had been made as to the design and specifications of the plans.\n\nBoth the architect and council were sued following the collapse of the stage. The architect was held liable in negligence\n\n\nThe council was also held vicariously liable for the negligence of the architect it employed and directly negligent for its failure to review, through its Public Works Department, whether the plans submitted by the architect complied with the relevant by-laws\n\n\n\n\nEngineers\n\nThe High Court decision in Woolcock Street Investments Pty Ltd v CDG Pty Ltd (2004) 216 CLR 515 concerned a commercial structure and the liability of engineers for pure economic loss to subsequent purchasers of the building.\n\nThe High Court concluded that the building’s original project engineers did not owe a duty of care to the subsequent purchaser of the building to avoid pure economic loss arising from latent defects in the building.\nThe court held that there was no duty of care owed by the engineers to Woolcock as the plaintiff was not vulnerable.\nThe High Court noted that the defendants were consulting and civil engineers engaged under a commercial bargain and that the plaintiff was a sophisticated commercial investor who could have protected itself by investigating whether there were defects in the building before purchasing it.\n\n\n\n\nCouncils\n\nIn Sutherland Shire Council v Heyman (1985) 157 CLR 424, the High Court held that the council owed no duty to the plaintiffs (the second owners of a house) to take reasonable care to ensure that the house had been constructed in accordance with plans that the council had approved,\n\nInadequate foundations had been laid by the builder and the council had statutory powers to inspect the footings of the house during construction, which the plaintiffs claimed it had negligently failed to do.\nAfter buying the house, the plaintiffs had to pay for repairs resulting from the faulty foundations\n\n\nheld that the council owed no relevant duty of care to the plaintiffs because they had not relied on any inquiry of the council concerning the foundations or inspection.\n\n\nThe liability of a council in respect of a development application and a building approval was considered by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Makawe Pty Ltd v Randwick City Council (2009) 171 LGERA 165\n\nBackground\n\nThat was a case where the car park in the basement of the plaintiff’s building was prone to flood because of fluctuations in the level of the water table which was in close proximity to the concrete slab floor.\nRandwick City Council which approved the development and construction of the building, before the purchase by the plaintiff, was in possession of a geo-technical report disclosing the flooding problem, at the time of the building approval.\n\n\nHeld\n\nthe Court of Appeal held that the council owed no duty of care to Makawe Pty Ltd\nlack of actual knowledge of the specific problem by the relevant council officer\n\nconsidered the salient features of the duty of care in such cases, including the lack of vulnerability of the plaintiff, the absence of specific reliance by the plaintiff on the defendant, the degree of control by the council and any assumption of responsibility by the council.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Ku-ring-gai Council v Chan [2017] NSWCA 226,\n\na council was held not to owe a duty of care to a subsequent purchaser of a suburban home in respect of defects that could have been discovered by the council as certifying authority before it issued an ‘occupation certificate’ to the owner-builder following completion of renovations.\n\n\nAll the provisions concerning statutory authorities included in civil liability legislation in various Australian jurisdictions, must now be considered in these types of cases, where a claim is based on the failure of a council to exercise its statutory powers59 to regulate building and construction\n\n\n\nWeek 12: CH 20: Vicarious Liability, Non-Delegable Duties, Concurrent and Proportionate Liability\n\nVicarious Liability and Non-delegable Duties\n\nTwo categories where persons are held liable for damage even where they themselves are not at fault\n\n(a) vicarious liability;

Albrighton v RPAH [1980] 2 NSWLR 542\nSchool authority/student – Commonwealth v Introvigne (1982) 150 CLR 258;\nLand occupier/danger to neighbour – Burnie v General Jones Pty Ltd (1994)179 CLR 520\n\n\n\n\nVicarious Liability\nVicarious liability originated in England in the 17th century.\nAt common law, there are two principal areas where vicarious liability is imposed:\n\n(1) between an employer and an employee\nand (2) between a principal and agent.\n\n\nIn each of these areas, for vicarious liability to arise, there must be:\n\n(a) a relationship of employment or agency between the defendant and the wrongdoer;\n(b) a tort committed by the employee or agent; and\n(c) the tort must occur during the course of the employment or agency relationship.\n\n\nCivil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) s 3C states that ‘any provision of this Act that excludes or limits the civil liability of a person for a tort also operates to exclude or limit the vicarious liability of another person for that tort’.7\r\n- This means that the Act does not ‘seek to differentiate in its operation between direct and vicarious liability’\nEmployee and employer\n\nEmployers are vicariously liable for torts of their employees committed during the course of employment\n\nIn Hollis v Vabu Pty Ltd (2001) 207 CLR 21, the High Court noted that the origins of the rule lie in the responsibility of a master for his household, his family and his servants.\n\n\nVicarious liability allows a plaintiff access to a defendant with the capacity to pay damages\nBoth the employer and the employee may be jointly and severally liable for torts of the employee committed within the course of employment\n\nNew South Wales v Ibbett (2006) 229 CLR 63\n\nPolice actions when investigating entering garage, [o]pen the bloody door and let my mate in’.\nThe two men were police officers and were arresting her son on suspicion of traffic offences\nWhile New South Wales v Ibbett concerns police, the precedent applies to all employment relationships.\n\nThis case confirms that employers are liable for all damages flowing from their employees’ conduct for disregarding the plaintiffs’ rights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVicarious liability elements\n\n(a) there must be an employment relationship; and\n(b) the negligent conduct must occur during the course of employment\n\n\n\n\nIs there a contract of service (employee) or a contract for services (independent contractor)?\n\nNo single test is sufficient:\n\nControl Test - Zujis v Wirth Bros (1955) 93 CLR 561\n\n\nControl for services (CONTRACTOR) vs control of service (EMPLOYEE)\n\nThe essence of a contract of service is the supply of the work and skill of a man.\nThe High Court stated that the classic test for determining whether there is a contract of service as opposed to a contract for services is the degree of control which one person has over the other.\n\n\n\n\nThere must be a relationship of employment\r\n- Whether they are in an employment relationship or not is up to the court and is not determined by the parties’ own description of their relationship.\r\n- Originally the courts used the ‘control test’ to determine whether an employment relationship existed: did the employer have a sufficient degree of control over what tasks were performed by an employee and the manner in which they were performed?\r\n- So the courts developed a more flexible approach using ‘scope for control’ by the employer as one of several indicators of an employment relationship. The relevant factors that have been identified by the High Court include:\n\nscope for control by the employer;\nthe description of the position in any written or verbal contract;\nthe right to suspend or dismiss;\nthe right to dictate the place of work, hours of work and the like;\nwhether tools are supplied and maintained by the ‘employer’ (this would indicate an employee as opposed to an independent contractor who may bring and maintain their own tools);\nthe right to the exclusive services of the person engaged;\n\nwhether work may be freely sub-contracted to someone else (if this may be done, it indicates an independent contractor);\n\n\nmode of remuneration: whether a traditional wage is paid (indicates employee) as opposed to a commission, retainer, or being paid on invoice (independent contractor); and\nwhat forms of tax/superannuation are paid and by whom are they paid.\n\n\nIn Stevens v Brodribb Sawmilling Co Pty Ltd (1986) 160 CLR 16,\n\nthe High Court held that the totality of the relationship between the parties must be considered and decided that there is no single ‘checklist’ of indicia to distinguish the relationship between employer-employee or employer-independent contractor.\nthe evidence of control, whilst significant, is not the sole criterion by which to gauge whether a relationship is one of employment.\n\nThe approach of this court has been to regard it merely as one of a number of indicia which must be considered in the determination of that question…77\nMason J. listed other relvant matters as:\n\n(i) the mode of remuneration;\n(ii) the provision and maintenance of equipment;\n(iii) the obligation to work;\n(iv) the hours of work and provision for holidays;\n(v) the deduction of income tax; and\n(vi) the delegation of work by the putative employee.78\n\n\nFurther indicia were listed by Wilson and Dawson JJ. They said factors which tended to establish a contract of service rather than a contract for services were:\n\n(i) the right to have a particular person do the work;\n(ii) the right to suspend or dismiss the person engaged;\n(iii) the right to the exclusive services of the person engaged; and\n(iv) the right to dictate the place of work, hours of work and the like.79\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Stevens v Brodribb Sawmilling,\n\nthe High Court had to determine whether tree-fellers, sniggers and truckers working in the timber industry were independent contractors or employees.\nThe fellers cut down trees which the snigger pulled to a ramp by tractor from where the trucker carried the logs to the defendant’s sawmill. The plaintiff trucker was injured through the negligence of a snigger while a log was being loaded.\nThe High Court held the defendant sawmill was not vicariously liable for the acts of the snigger as the snigger was not an employee. The court rejected the ‘control’ test that had previously been influential as a single determinant\n\n\nLeading Australian authority on indicia\n\nHollis v Vabu Pty Ltd (2001) 207 CLR 21 where the High Court applied the ‘various indicia’ approach\n\nThere the appellant/plaintiff had suffered injury to his knee through being knocked down on a footpath by a bicycle courier.\nThe courier, although unidentified, was wearing a uniform bearing the respondent’s trade name, ‘Crisis Couriers’.\nThe appellant sued Vabu (which traded as Crisis Couriers) on the basis that, as the bicycle courier was an employee of Vabu and he had been negligent, Vabu was vicariously liable for the tort of its employee.\nThe High Court held that the bicycle couriers were employees and that Crisis Couriers was vicariously liable for the negligence of the courier.\nThe High Court majority, however, rejected a test based exclusively on an ‘enterprise test’\n\n\n\n\nThe Hollis approach was applied by the High Court in Sweeney v Boylan Nominees Pty Ltd (2006) 226 CLR 161 with a very different outcome.\n\nIn Sweeney, the High Court held that Boylan Nominees were not vicariously liable for the sub-standard maintenance work performed by a refrigeration mechanic retained by Boylan because he was an independent contractor rather than an employee.\nThe plaintiff, Mrs Sweeney, suffered physical injury when she opened the door of a refrigerator at a service station to buy milk and the door fell off.\nBoylan was responsible for the maintenance of the refrigerator and the mechanic who performed the work for Boylan did so on a regular basis, at Boylan’s request and direction.\n\nIn a 5 to 1 decision, the High Court followed Vabu and found that the mechanic who had ‘fixed’ the door was an independent contractor and not the employee of Boylan as he conducted his own business and supplied his own tools and invoiced Boylan for each separate repair job.\n\n\n\n\n‘Akin’ to employment relationships\r\n- In Northern Sandblasting Pty Ltd v Harris, and in Hollis v Vabu Pty Ltd, McHugh J agreed with Professor Atiyah and favoured expansion of the law.\n\nThe majority of the High Court, however, has never adopted that view.\r\n- There are cases where the traditional employment test has proved inadequate to deal with persons who are neither employees nor independent contractors.\r\n- In religious organisations, for example, the position of a priest or religious official or lay member almost certainly falls outside the traditional employment relationship.\n\n\nDuring the course of employment\r\n- Liability will only follow when a tort is committed by an employee during the course of employment.\r\n- The joint judgment in Prince Alfred College Incorporated v ADC recognised that there is no ‘general basis’ for the imposition of vicarious liability and refers to the methodology to be used\r\n- In Phoenix Society Inc v Cavanagh (1997) 25 MVR 143, a drunken bus driver collided with a car and injured the plaintiff who was driving the car.\n\nThe bus driver had been specifically warned by her employer not to drink and drive.\nThe employer was nevertheless held to be liable for her negligent act.\nThe employee in each case was employed to perform the task which resulted in damage – the filling up of petrol and the driving of a bus.\n\nthe act of the employee must be a task that is part of their employment even though they might be carrying out the authorised task in an unauthorised way\n\n\n\n\nIn Pioneer Mortgage Services Pty Ltd v Columbus Capital Pty Ltd [2016] FCAFC 78,\n\nthe Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia held that the fraudulent theft of funds by an employee was within the scope of employment.\nThe fraud was committed by the employee via a secure and complex software system (called Origin CAP BUREAU) to which the ANZ Bank had provided access to her employer.\n\n\nCriminal acts by employees and the ‘relevant approach’ to vicarious liability\n\nIn several common law jurisdictions, vicarious liability has been imposed in cases of criminal child sexual abuse.\n\nSchool authorities have been held to be vicariously liable for the acts of their employees who committed sexual assaults upon students.\n\nin the United Kingdom in Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd [2002] 1 AC 215 and more recently, in some Australian State Supreme and appellate courts.\nIn Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd [2002] 1 AC 215, the House of Lords held that the test was ‘whether the [employee’s] torts were so closely connected with his employment that it would be fair and just to hold the employers vicariously liable’.\n\nLord Steyn described the sexual abuse in that case as ‘inextricably interwoven’ with the employee’s performance of his duties (230) and accordingly within the course of employment\n\n\n\n\nIn Australia, the ‘scope of employment’ principle has not been as broadly formulated as in Canada and the United Kingdom and it has presented considerable difficulty for plaintiffs in claims against schools and other institutions with respect to vicarious liability for sexual assault.\n\n\nIn New South Wales v Lepore (2003) 212 CLR 511,\n\nby a majority of 5 to 1 the High Court allowed an appeal by a school authority deciding that a school authority may be vicariously liable for sexual assault by a teacher on the basis of it being within the course of employment.\nThe majority ordered a new trial on the question of the school’s vicarious liability for the criminal assaults by the teacher. Gleeson CJ held that the possibility of a school authority’s vicarious liability for sexual abuse could not be dismissed for the sole reason that it constitutes serious misconduct on the part of the teacher.\nGleeson CJ held that where the teacher-student relationship is invested with a high degree of power and intimacy, the use of that power and intimacy to commit sexual abuse may provide a sufficient connection between the sexual assault and the employment.\nThe non-delegable duty of care owed by a school to its pupils should not be extended to encompass liability for intentional (as opposed to negligent) conduct of an employee (who had acted outside the scope of employment)\n\n\n\n\nThe High Court had an opportunity to revisit the question of vicarious liability for criminal sexual assault by a teacher in Prince Alfred College Incorporated v ADC (2016) 258 CLR\n\nSo the Australian approach requires a court to consider any special role of the employee and whether it provides the occasion for wrongdoing because of the employee’s authority, power, trust, control and the ability to achieve intimacy with the victim.\n\n\nThe indemnity principle\r\n- While an employer will be vicariously liable for acts of its employees which occur during the course of their employment, they may be able to recoup their loss through the indemnity principle\n\nAt common law, a term is implied into contracts of employment that an employee will exercise all reasonable care and skill during the course of employment.\n\nA negligent employee will breach this term.\nAs a result, the employer who has been held vicariously liable for the tort of an employee may seek an indemnity from the employee to make good the loss\n\n\nIn New South Wales, the Northern Territory and South Australia, the employer’s right of indemnity has been removed by legislation and, instead, it ensures that the employer will indemnify the employee against liability.\r\n- In Lister v Romford Ice &amp; Cold Storage Co Ltd [1957] AC 555, a father was injured when knocked down by his son, who was employed by Romford Ice, while backing his lorry in a yard\nThe employers were vicariously liable for the son’s negligence and their insurers met the father’s claim.\nThe insurers then sued the son in the company’s name, exercising their right of subrogation under the contract of insurance.\n\nThe court held that the son was liable to indemnify the employer and consequently the insurers.\nThis right of insurers to enforce the employer’s right of indemnity has been abolished by the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 (Cth), although the right remains where the employee’s act was one of ‘serious or wilful misconduct’.\n\n\n\n\nPrincipal and agent\n\nVicarious liability extends beyond employer and employee relationships.\n\nA principal is vicariously liable for torts committed by his or her agent\n\n\nAn agency relationship def is a contractual agreement whereby the principal gives the agent authority to act or enter into agreements on behalf of the principal\nIn Sweeney v Boylan Nominees Pty Ltd (2006) 226 CLR 161, the High Court held that vicarious liability for the acts of an agent:\n\ndepends directly upon the identification of the independent contractor as the principal’s agent … and the recognition that the conduct of which complaint is made was conduct undertaken in the course of, and for the purpose of, executing that agency\nthe High Court refused to extend vicarious liability based on agency were there was no legal agency in existence but rather a lesser arrangement whereby an independent contractor performed some services on behalf of another company\n\n\nWhen an agent acts within the course of an agency, he or she is legally acting with the authority of the principal, and so it follows that the principal should be vicariously liable for an agent’s acts\nVicarious liability may be imposed based on agency in the following additional two circumstances:\n\n(a) when the owner of a motor vehicle allows another person to drive it; and\n(b) when the principal holds out the agent as having authority to perform the act.\n\n\n\n\nCar owner and car driver\r\n- In Soblusky v Egan (1960) 103 CLR 215, the High Court established that at common law, the owner of a car will be vicariously liable for the negligent acts or omissions of the driver of the vehicle – where that person is driving with the owner’s permission.\r\n- The court applied the principle that the owner of a car is liable for the negligent driving of that car by another by way of agency, if two elements are present:\n\n(1) a request by the owner that the driver use the vehicle;\nand (2) an interest by the owner in the purpose for which the vehicle is being driven.\r\n- The court in Soblusky thereby used the principle of agency to impose liability upon the bailee of a motor vehicle for injuries caused to the passenger by the driver.\r\n- Soblusky had purchased his interest in the car from Behrendorff, who had purchased the vehicle under a hire purchase agreement and failed to notify the transfer of the vehicle to the Commission of Main Roads: Behrendorff thus remained the owner of the vehicle.\nLiability for motor accidents is now regulated by legislation, for example, the Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 (NSW) and equivalents, and the common law is subject to the presumed agency in legislation such as s 112 of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 (NSW).\n\n\nIn Scott v Davis, the owners of an aeroplane held a party at their property, and they agreed to give some guests at the party a ride in the plane.\n\nBackground\n\nOne of the owners asked a licensed pilot to fly the plane while he remained on the ground without any means of directing the pilot during the flight.\nThe plane crashed and the pilot was killed, and the guests injured.\nThe appellants (the plaintiffs, who were a boy who had been pulled from the wreckage and his parents who suffered nervous shock upon witnessing the accident) argued before the High Court that the principle in Soblusky v Egan applies to aircraft, that the pilot was the owners’ agent and that the owners were vicariously liable for the personal injuries caused by the pilot’s negligence.\n\n\nThe majority of the High Court dismissed this argument.\n\nthe owner was not vicariously liable for the negligence of the pilot as the owner had not retained any direction over the plane nor any control of it.\nprinciple of agency should not be extended beyond motor vehicles\n\n\n\n\nPrincipal holds out agent\r\n- Where the principal holds the agent out to a third party as having authority to act, the principal may be liable for tortious acts committed by the agent\r\n- Background\n\nIn Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd v Producers and Citizens Co-operative Assurance Co of Australia Ltd (1931) 46 CLR 141, vicarious liability was imposed upon an insurance company which left to its agent the choice of conversation and argument to be used in soliciting business.\nThis agent defamed another business while trying to sell insurance.\r\n- Held\nThe court held that the agent was not acting independently in obtaining proposals and receiving premiums but was the representative of the company with respect to those actions.\nThe defendant company, in leaving it up to the agent’s discretion as to how to bring in business, had effectively authorised or held the agent out as being their representative and as being able to make the defamatory statements.\n\n\n20.3 Non-delegable Duty\n\nIt was noted by Mason J, in Kondis v State Transport Authority (1984) 154 CLR 672, 687 that a non-delegable duty of care is not simply a duty to take reasonable care.\n\nIf it were a duty to take reasonable care, it could be delegated to a carefully selected and suitably qualified contractor.\nRather, a non-delegable duty of care is a duty to see that care is taken\n\n\nA non-delegable duty renders an employer, or other person owing an identified non-delegable duty of care, liable in situations where negligence is caused by an independent contractor even though vicarious liability will not apply.\n\n\nCommon law non-delegable duties\n\nGenerally, concepts of ‘control’ and ‘vulnerability’ are relevant to determine when and if a new non-delegable duty should be recognised.\nHospital and patient\n\nA hospital owes a non-delegable duty of care to its public patients.\nSince Ellis v Wallsend District Hospital (1989) 17 NSWLR 553, a hospital is liable to its public patients for all those who provide services in its name, regardless of whether they are hospital employees (such as nursing staff and registrar doctors) or independent contractors (such as visiting specialist doctors).\n\nThe court in Ellis drew a distinction between a ‘private’ patient who chooses and consults a specialist privately and a ‘public’ patient who approaches the hospital for treatment and who is referred to a visiting specialist by the hospital.\n\n\n\n\nSchool authority and pupil\nCommonwealth v Introvigne (1982) 150 CLR 258 established that a school authority owes a non-delegable duty to its pupils\n\nin New South Wales v Lepore (2003) 212 CLR 511, the High Court held that a school authority was not liable for the torts of teachers who sexually assaulted students at school.\n\nThe deliberate and intentional nature of the tortious acts by the teachers did not involve a failure to take reasonable care and the High Court held that only a failure to take reasonable care will constitute a breach of non-delegable\n\n\nThe non-delegable duty of care owed by a school to its pupils can be breached where the school contracts with outside providers of swimming lessons, school camps and the like and those contractors fail to take reasonable care for the safety of the school’s pupils.\n\n\nOccupier creating danger to neighbouring land users\nIn Burnie Port Authority v General Jones Pty Ltd (1994) 179 CLR 520, the High Court held that a dangerous use of land which damages a neighbour’s property will be subject to a non-delegable duty\nBackground\n\nIn this case, the Burnie Port Authority occupied a warehouse where it stored cardboard insulating material, but it also allowed welding to occur near that flammable material.\nBoth the storing of the materials and the welding were done by independent contractors.\nGeneral Jones Ltd stored frozen vegetables in the warehouse, which was burnt in the fire caused by the independent contractor’s negligence\nThe court recognised that the relationship was one where the defendant had control of the premises while the plaintiff, the neighbour of the defendant, was vulnerable to the defendant’s actions.\n\n\nIt was the nature of this relationship that was decisive in the imposition of the non-delegable duty of care\nTransfield Services (Australia) v Hall [2008] NSWCA 294 confirmed that the ratio in Burnie is limited in application. In Transfield Mr Hall sued three defendants:\n\nBackground\n\nATS, Transfield Services (Australia) Pty Ltd (Transfield) and QBE Insurance (Australia) Ltd (QBE) after he was injured at a navy physical fitness facility at HMAS Stirling in Western Australia.\nMr Hall was a physical instructor at the fitness facility and fell around 10 metres when preparing to abseil down some ropes.\nTransfield was responsible for the maintenance of the equipment and subcontracted the work to ATS.\nThe plaintiff did not sue his employer – the Royal Australian Navy – because the relevant workers compensation statute limited his ability to do so\n\n\nHeld\n\nThe trial judge held that Transfield owed a non-delegable duty of care to the plaintiff because of the dangerous nature of the ropes course and the elements of control and extreme dependency were present in the relationship between it and the plaintiff.\nAt trial, Transfield was held liable for the negligence of ATS\nnotwithstanding that ATS was an independent contractor engaged by Transfield.\n\n\nOn appeal,\n\nthe New South Wales Court of Appeal found that a non-delegable duty applied only in limited circumstances.\nThe court held that there is no non-delegable duty to ensure that reasonable care is taken by an independent contractor engaging in an extra-hazardous or inherently dangerous activity.\nThe court referred to Burnie Port Authority v General Jones Pty Ltd (1994) 179 CLR 520 and held that it did not detract from the principle decided in Stevens v Brodribb Sawmilling Co Pty Ltd (1986) 160 CLR 16 that there is no general doctrine in Australian law that there is a non-delegable duty in respect of extra-hazardous activities\n\n\nThe recent case of Herridge Parties v Electricity Networks Corporation (t/as Western Power) [2021] WASCA 111 also ‘rejected the proposition that a principal is liable for the negligence of an independent contractor merely on the basis that the activities the contractor was engaged to perform were extra-hazardous’\n\n\nEmployer and employee\nIn Kondis v State Transport Authority (1984) 154 CLR 672, an employer was held to owe a non-delegable duty to its employee.\n\nThe plaintiff employee was injured by the jib of a crane which fell. The crane was being operated by an independent contractor who had been hired by the defendant employer.\nThe High Court held that, while the employer was not vicariously liable for the negligence of the independent contractor, the employer was liable for the plaintiff’s injury because an employer owes an employee a personal non-delegable duty of care.\nTherefore, the failure of the independent contractor to adopt a safe system of work breached the duty of the employer to ensure that reasonable care was taken for the safety of the plaintiff employee.\n\n\nNo non-delegable duty between road authority and road users\nIn Leichhardt Municipal Council v Montgomery (2007) 230 CLR 22, the High Court held that Leichhardt Council, a road authority, did not owe a non-delegable duty of care to road users.\n\nIn this case, Mr Montgomery fell into a poorly covered telecommunications pit and suffered injury.\n\nGleeson CJ’s judgment turned upon the relevant legislation: the Roads Act 1993 (NSW), holding that the legislation did not establish a non-delegable duty of\nThe other High Court justices took a broader view of the issue, deciding that as a matter of principle a non-delegable duty should not be extended to road authorities\n\n\nGenerally the High Court rejected the view that the non-delegable duty is an independent tort.\nCertain members of the court made comment on the relationship between the non-delegable duty and vicarious liability.\n\nKirby J held that the dependence that exists between the road user and the road authority does not rise to the level of particular vulnerability or special dependence evident in the established relationships of non-delegable duty.\nKirby J’s view that a special vulnerability is the basis for non-delegable duties was not endorsed by other judges.\nHayne J opined that the non-delegable duty was a simple exception to the rules of vicarious liability.\n\n\nThe result of Leichhardt Municipal Council v Montgomery is that the High Court would not extend the principle of non-delegable duty beyond the already established categories.\nThe categories of non-delegable duty are, however, not closed\n\n\nCivil Liability Legislation: Vicarious Liability and Non-delegable Duty\n\nThe tort reform legislation in New South Wales and Victoria provides that breach of a non-delegable duty of care is to be determined as if it were vicarious liability\ns 5Q of the Civil Liability Act 2002\n\n5Q Liability based on non-delegable duty\n\n\n\nThe extent of liability in tort of a person (‘the defendant’) for breach of a non-delegable duty to ensure that reasonable care is taken by a person in the carrying out of any work or task delegated or otherwise entrusted to the person by the defendant is to be determined as if the liability were the vicarious liability of the defendant for the negligence of the person in connection with the performance of the work or task.\n\n\n(2) This section applies to an action in tort whether or not it is an action in negligence, despite anything to the contrary in section 5A.\n\n\nNon-delegable duty is a primary independent duty to ensure that care is taken:\n\nnot a duty to take care and not a duty to avoid negligent conduct.\n\n\nIn Galea v Bagtrans Pty Ltd [2010] NSWCA 350, Allsop P and Hodgson JA, in separate judgments (Macfarlan JA agreeing with both), applied s 5Q of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW).\n\nBackground\n\nMr Galea was employed by Adecco Industrial Pty Ltd, a labour hire company. Galea was lent on hire as a truck driver to Bagtrans Pty Ltd.\nWhen the seat in the Mack truck he was driving caused Galea discomfort, he complained.\nGalea was told wrongly that the seat had been fixed.\nHe drove over 5 or 10 kilometres of road with potholes and heard his neck crack on three occasions.\nThe trial judge found neither Bagtrans nor Adecco liable, this was reversed by the New South Wales Court of Appeal.\n\n\nHeld\n\nThe Court of Appeal noted that Adecco, as employer, has a non-delegable duty to exercise reasonable care to provide employees with a safe place of work, a safe system of work and safe plant and equipment, which extends to maintenance and repair of plant and equipment.\nAs an employer, Adecco had entrusted Bagtrans to provide Galea with the place and/or system of work, and/or with plant and equipment, Adecco was liable for Bagtrans failing to exercise reasonable care\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 12: Contribution Among Tortfeasors\n\nContribution Among Tortfeasors\n\nWhere there are multiple tortfeasors there are two types of liability which may be imposed in terms of the defendants’ contribution to the plaintiff’s damage:\n\n\n\nsolidary liability; and\n\n\neach tortfeasor or wrongdoer is jointly and severally liable to the plaintiff for the whole of the damage, although by virtue of statute in all jurisdictions,\n\na tortfeasor will be entitled to recover ‘contribution’ from the other tortfeasors towards any damages paid to the plaintiff\n\n\nthe risk of non-payment by one tortfeasor impacts upon the other tortfeasors rather than on the plaintiff.\n\n\n\n\nproportionate liability\n\n\nProportionate liability is unknown to the common law but has been introduced by statute in all Australian jurisdictions, applying generally to claims for pure economic loss or property damage caused by failure to take reasonable care\nProportionate liability def\n\ndescribes the situation where each wrongdoer is liable to the plaintiff only for his or her proportionate share of the plaintiff’s loss.\n\n\nThis is procedurally more difficult and means that the plaintiff bears the risk of defendants who are insolvent or otherwise not able to be sued or to satisfy a judgment.\n\n\nThe types of case where multiple tortfeasors will be responsible for a plaintiff’s damage are:\n\n(a) joint tortfeasors where two or more act together in concert to cause the totality of the plaintiff’s damage;\n(b) several concurrent tortfeasors where two or more each commit separate torts but together cause the totality of the plaintiff’s damage; and\n(c) several tortfeasors causing different damage, where each commits a separate tort and each causes separate damage to the plaintiff.\n\n\n(a) and (b) above are examples of solidary liability where the defendant tortfeasors will be jointly and severally liable to the plaintiff for the totality of the damage caused\nIn (c) above, which is an example of several (but not joint) liability, the tortfeasors will be only severally liable for the specific different damage each caused\n\n\nSolidary liability\n\nAt common law, joint or concurrent tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable for the damage they cause.\nCritics don’t like going after insured/rich defendants just because of ability to pay despite minimal liability\n\nWhere the plaintiff recovers against one defendant, that defendant may seek to recover some or all of the damages from other tortfeasors by virtue of statutory contribution provisions,6 though it was not possible to do so at common law\n\n\n\n\nProportional liability\n\ncivil liability legislation has substituted proportionate liability in the place of joint and several liability in claims for pure economic loss or damage to property caused by failure to take reasonable care.\n\ncommon law solidary liability is retained with respect to personal injury claims against joint and concurrent tortfeasors for all torts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24.2 Solidary Liability\nJoint tortfeasors def\n\nJoint tortfeasors are persons who commit one single tort so that the plaintiff has only one cause of action.\nWhere there is an agency, principal and agent will be joint tortfeasors if a tort is committed by the agent.\n\n\nIn Thompson v Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd (1996) 186 CLR 574,\n\nthe High Court held that two television stations which broadcast a defamation pursuant to a licence agreement between them were joint tortfeasors because of their concerted action.\n\n\nAnother instance in which joint liability will occur is where two or more persons share a joint duty of care:\n\nfor example, where two persons are the occupiers of premises on which a visitor is injured because of a negligent failure to repair a danger.\n\n\nWhere tortfeasors are joint as opposed to concurrent (that is, there is only one tort committed by all joint tortfeasors – not several torts, one committed by each tortfeasor) a judgment against, or a settlement and release of, one tortfeasor meant that there could be no proceedings or recovery against any of the other joint tortfeasors.\nJoint tortfeasor vs concurrent tortfeasor\n\nJoint = multiple people doing one action\n\nJointly and severally liable for the entire damage, meaning any one of them can be held responsible for the entire amount of damages.\n\n\nConcurrent = multiple people independently committing separate acts that contribute to the same damage or loss.\n\nLiability is generally several but can sometimes be joint and several\n\n\n\n\nDe Reus v Gray (2003) 9 VR 432, the court was asked whether a court can, and in what circumstances, assess aggravated compensatory damages differentially against two or more joint tortfeasors who are liable in respect of the same damage.\n\nIn that case, the jury found that a strip search by three police of the plaintiff, Ms Gray, in the corridor of the police station adjacent to a cell containing a window through which she believed she could be seen was an unnecessary and unauthorised use of police power.\n\n\nConcurrent tortfeasors\n\nConcurrent tortfeasors def\n\nIn some cases, even though persons are not acting in concert or together in any way, they may nevertheless inflict a single injury in that they are responsible for separate tortious acts which combine together to cause the plaintiff’s damage\nChapman v Hearse\n\n\nSeveral tortfeasors causing different damage: no solidary liability\n\nIn some circumstances, two or more separate tortfeasors each commit a separate tortious act and each act causes separate and different damage to the same plaintiff.\n\nSo, for example, where the plaintiff’s car is damaged twice in two separate collisions, each caused by the negligence of a different driver on two separate occasions, the plaintiff will have two causes of action (one against each of the negligent drivers) and each action will be in respect of the separate damage caused by the particular defendant driver. I\n\n\nPerformance Cars LTD v Abraham\n\nThere, however, the second collision damaged the car on the same panel that had been damaged by the first collision.\nBecause the panel was already damaged and needed to be resprayed at the time of the second collision, the court held that the cost of the respraying should be borne by the first tortfeasor.\n\nBecause the tortfeasors were not joint or concurrent tortfeasors, there could be no question of them having to share the cost of the respraying.\n\n\nThe second negligent driver ran into a car that was already damaged and required respraying, so he could not be held responsible for the respray.\n\n\n\n\nContribution between tortfeasors\n\nThe common law rule in Merryweather v Nixan (1799) 8 Term Rep 186; 101 ER 1337\n\nwas that there was no right to contribution between tortfeasors.\nSo, a tortfeasor against whom a judgment was obtained or with whom a settlement was reached and who was liable to pay the whole of the plaintiff’s damages had no right to require a contribution from any other tortfeasor.\nThe effect of the rule in Merryweather v Nixan has been abrogated by statute in all Australian jurisdictions\n\n\nThe legislation generally provides that a court is to assess the quantum of the contribution payable by respective wrongdoers as an amount which is ‘just and equitable’,27 having regard to the extent of the defendant’s responsibility for the damage.\n\nContribution may only be claimed from a wrongdoer who has contributed to causing the ‘same damage’ to the plaintiff as another wrongdoer.\nContribution may be claimed from a person who ‘is or would if sued, have been liable’ to pay damages.\nSo it is immaterial whether all wrongdoers have been joined as defendants to the plaintiff’s proceedings.\nIt does not matter that the plaintiff has not commenced any proceedings at all against a wrongdoer from whom contribution is sought.\n\n\nThe High Court held in Brambles Construction Pty Ltd v Helmers (1966) 114 CLR 213 that the words ‘at any time’ in the New South Wales legislation should be understood as following the words ‘if sued’ in the relevant section.\nthe plaintiff may recover the whole of the damage (subject to any reduction for contributory negligence) from any or all of them.\n\n\nLister v Romford Ice &amp; Cold Storage Co Ltd [1957] AC 55\n\nan employee was injured because of the negligence of another employee.\nThe employer was sued successfully for damages on the basis that it was vicariously liable for the tort of thefellow employee. The employer’s insurer, who was liable to pay the damages, relied on its rights of ‘subrogation’ to step into the employer’s place and to pursue its right to claim contribution from the tortfeasor, the fellow employee\n\n\nIn Australia, several States have enacted legislation to remove the effect of the Lister case.\n\nThe Employees Liability Act 1991 (NSW) ss 3-5, provides that, notwithstanding any legislation or law or the express or implied provisions of any contract, an employee is not liable to indemnify an employer in respect of the employer’s vicarious liability for the tort of the employee unless the employee’s negligence amounts to serious and wilful misconduct\nThe protection of the legislation does not extend to serious and wilful misconduct by the employee\n\n\n\n\n24.3 Proportionate Liability\n\n\nUnder proportionate liability\n\nWhere plaintiffs have suffered pure economic loss or property damage caused by the negligence of two or more defendants, they may now recover from a given defendant only the proportion of the loss caused by that defendant.\nA plaintiff will bear the loss where a wrongdoer is untraceable or insolvent\nDefendants will now pay only a proportion of the damages according to their level of responsibility as determined by the court.\n\n\n\nApportionable claims\n\nFor proportionate liability to apply a claim must be an ‘apportionable claim’.\nApportionable claims are defined in similar terms in all jurisdictions,\ns 24AF(1) of the Wrongs Act 1958 (VIC) apoportionable claims def:\n(a) a claim for economic loss or damage to property in an action for damages (whether in tort, in contract, under statute or otherwise) arising from a failure to take reasonable care; or\n(b) a claim for damages for a contravention of s 9 of the Fair Trading Act 1999\nThe Victorian Court of Appeal considered the meaning of ‘action for damages’ in s 24AF(1)(a) above in Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Witherow [2006] VSCA 45.\n\nThe court held that a claim for a sum certain (that is, a specific amount owed under a deed of guarantee) was not an action for damages.\n\n\n\nThe New South Wales Court of Appeal held unanimously in Cassegrain v Cassegrain [2016] NSWCA 71 that a claim for equitable compensation arising from a plaintiff’s knowing receipt of company property transferred by the direction of directors in breach of their fiduciary duties was not a claim ‘arising from a failure to take reasonable care’.\n\nAccordingly, the proportionate liability provisions of Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) were not applicable.\n\n\n\n\n\nA ‘just’ proportion of the damage\n\nthe court can take into account all concurrent wrongdoers whether or not they are parties to the proceedings before the court.\n\nwhere an apportionable claim is involved, the defendant is obliged to inform the plaintiff in writing where the defendant reasonably believes that another person may be a concurrent wrongdoer.\n\n\nIn each jurisdiction, the apportionment of responsibility amongst multiple wrongdoers is to be made by the court on the basis of what it considers to reflect each wrongdoer’s responsibility for the damage.\n\nIn all jurisdictions except Queensland, the apportionment is to be made on the basis of what is ‘just’.4\n\n\nIn Yates v Mobile Marine Repairs Pty Ltd [2007] NSWSC 505, Palmer J in the Supreme Court of New South Wales applied s 35 of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) to apportion responsibility between a wrongdoer who committed a breach of contract and a wrongdoer who committed a tort\n\nThe first defendant (Mobile Marine) carried on the business of repairing marine engines and negligently conducted some repair work and also breached a contract.\nThe first defendant was the Sydney agent of the second defendant (MAN Australia) (who breached an implied term in its contract with the plaintiff that the repair work would be carried out with reasonable care, skill and diligence).\nHeld\n\nHaving considered aspects such as ‘which of the wrongdoers was more actively engaged in the activity causing loss’ and ‘which of the wrongdoers was more able effectively to prevent the loss happening’, his Honour found the loss should be apportioned equally between the defendants as, although the tortfeasor (Mobile Marine) was more actively engaged in the loss, the second defendant MAN that was in breach of contract had expertise and responsibility under contract to prevent the negligence of Mobile Marine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConcurrent wrongdoers and the ‘same’ damage\n\nIn order to have the benefit of proportionate liability a defendant must be a ‘concurrent wrongdoer defined as ‘one of two or more persons whose acts or omissions … caused, independently of each other or jointly, the damage or loss that is the subject of the claim’.\nHunt &amp; Hunt Lawyers v Mitchell Morgan Nominees Pty Ltd (2013) 247 CLR\n\nBroad view of what constituted the ‘same damage’\nthe court also had to determine whether in addition to the lawyers, there was another person whose act or omission caused the plaintiff’s loss, in order for the proportionate liability provision to apply.\nthe two successive wrongdoers were concurrent causes of the loss and the majority referred to the criticisms of the ‘but for’ test in March v E &amp; MH Stramare Pty Ltd\nHunt &amp; Hunt’s appeal to the High Court was allowed and the trial judge’s order stood:\n\nthat Hunt &amp; Hunt were ‘concurrent wrongdoers’ under s 34(2) of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) and that their liability should be limited to 12.5% of Mitchell Morgan’s loss.\n\n\n\n\nSt George Bank v Quinerts Pty Ltd [2009] VR 66\nFacts\n\nQuinerts Pty Ltd, who had been retained by St George Bank, negligently overvalued a property in Melbourne.\nSt George lent money on the security of the property and when the borrower defaulted, the subsequent sale of the property resulted in a significant loss to St George.\nQuinerts admitted that their valuation was negligent and attempted to reduce its share of liability for the bank’s losses by relying on the proportionate liability provisions in the Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic).\n\nQuinerts argued that the borrower and the guarantor were ‘concurrent wrongdoers’ (with Quinerts) within the meaning of Pt IVAA of the Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) and, therefore, that its own liability was limited by s 24AI of that Act to an amount reflecting the proportion of the loss or damage claimed that the court considered just having regard to the extent of Quinerts’ responsibility for the loss and damage\n\n\n\n\nNettle J (with whom Mandie JA and Beach AJA agreed) held that the borrower and the guarantors were not concurrent wrongdoers (with Quinerts) because they were not responsible for the same damage as Quinerts\n\nIn effect, the distinction his Honour made was that Quinerts caused the loss and damage of the bank through an overvaluation of the property, so that the bank had an inadequate security.\nOn the other hand, the borrower or guarantor did not do anything to cause the bank to incur that loss and damage (the inadequate security).\n\n\n\n\n\nWoodhouse v Fitzgerald and McCoy [2021] NSWCA 5\n\nfurther considered Hunt &amp; Hunt in addressing whether the proportionate liability provisions of the’NSW CLA’ apply when one of the alleged concurrent wrongdoers have a statutory immunity from suit.\n\n– here the Rural Fire Service (RFS) –\n\n\ndetermining that the issue in Hunt &amp; Hunt was ‘not whether the reference in s 34(2) to two or more persons having “caused” damage or loss engaged legal liability’ ([87]) and therefore Hunt &amp; Hunt was not concerned with the meaning of the word ‘caused’ within the proportionate liability scheme in the NSW CLA.\nFacts\n\nThe facts of Woodhouse concerned absentee landowners who asked the RFS to conduct a hazard reduction burn which the landowners were required to perform under the Noxious Weeds Act 1993 (NSW)\nAs a result of the hazard burn, on 28 August 2012, 550 acres of the defendants’ property was burnt by the RFS, including land close to the border of the plaintiff’s property.\n\nOn 5 September a fire occurred at the neighbour’s property, causing $1.2 million worth of damage to the plaintiff’s property.\n\n\nthe construction of the NSW CLA ‘legislation requires that the concurrent wrongdoer has at some stage been legally liable, even if no longer subject to a possible suit’\nAs the RFS was not liable to the plaintiffs due to the statutory immunity from suit in the Rural Fires Act 1997 (NSW), the RFS was never legally liable and so could not be proportionately liable as having caused damage or loss as a concurrent wrongdoer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCCIG Investments Pty Ltd v Schokman [2023] HCA 21\nBackground\n\nMr Schokman was employed by CCIG Investments to work at a resort in the Whitsunday Islands.\nA requirement of his employment was to live in furnished, shared accommodation.\nHe shared his room with Mr Hewett, another employee.\nMr Hewett, intoxicated, urinated on Mr Schokman, causing him distress and a cataplectic attack.\n\n\nLegal Issue\n\nWhether CCIG Investments was vicariously liable for the tortious act committed by Mr Hewett against Mr Schokman.\n\n\nRatio\n\nThe key issue was whether the tortious act was committed in the course or scope of employment.\nThe High Court stated that this depends on what the employee was actually employed to do, and nothing in this case suggested that Mr Hewett’s actions were related to his employment.\n\n\nDecision\n\nThe High Court allowed the appeal from CCIG Investments, overturning the Court of Appeal’s decision.\nThe court held that the employer was not vicariously liable for Mr Hewett’s actions.\n\n\nApplication\n\nThe decision clarifies the extent of an employer’s vicarious liability for acts committed by employees in shared accommodation.\nThe case indicates that the connection between the wrongful act and the employment must be more than just a situational opportunity provided by the employment.\n\n\nBugge v Brown (1919) 26 CLR 110\n\nA prohibition as to manner, time, or place, or as to the very act itself will not necessarily limit the sphere of employment;\nTo limit the sphere of employment the prohibition “must be such that its violation makes the servant’s conduct …so distinctly remote and disconnected from his employment…”;\nAn agent is a person authorised by their principal to legally bind the principal and third parties;\nThe principal’s liability will arise in relation to acts of the agent done in the course of carrying out the principal’s authority: Soblusky v Egan (1960) 103 CLR 215; Scott v Davis (2000) 204 CLR 333.\n\n\n\nSelf Learning: Statutory Authorities, Omissions and other Duties\nCH 18 - Liability of Statutory Authorities in Negligence\n\nA statutory (or public) authority def is a creation of statute.\n\nA statutory authority is a body authorised by Parliament to carry out duties and powers in the performance of a public function.\nLocal councils, highway and transport authorities are examples of such authorities.\nDifferential treatment\n\nFirst, statutory authorities are created by and operate according to legislative instruments.\n\nAs an authority exercises its functions according to the statute which creates it, a tortious action against a statutory authority may turn upon the interpretation of statutory provisions.\n\n\nSecondly, as Parliament is the body which gives statutory authorities their powers, functions and duties, courts will take note of ‘special factors’ which attach to tortious liability of a public authority.\n\n\nCrimmins v Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee (1999) 200 CLR 1,\n\n‘there may be special factors applicable to a statutory authority which negative a duty of care that a private individual would owe in apparently similar circumstances’.\nThese special factors may include policy choices by the authority and resource constraints (\n\n\nThe following tortious actions which apply to statutory authorities:\n\n\n\nThe tort of negligence for:\n\n\n(a) failure to exercise a statutory function (this chapter); or\n(b) the negligent exercise of a statutory function (this chapter).\n\n\n\n\nThe tort of breach of statutory duty\n\n\n\n\n18.2 Statutory Authorities and Negligence\n\nFor a statutory authority to be liable in the tort of negligence all elements of the tort must be made out:\n\nduty of care, breach of duty, causation and remoteness of damage\nAKA, include normal negligence conditions (CLA + Common Law)\n\n\nThere are two possible bases for negligence actions against statutory authorities in relation to the exercise or non-exercise of statutory functions:\n\n\n\nan action in respect of an omission to act such as where a statutory authority has failed to exercise a statutory power or duty (and that failure to act is alleged to be negligent);

([39])\nSince the distinction between policy and operational issues was made by the High Court, High Court justices have used the concept to distinguish matters of policy when considering whether a duty of care has been breached.\nThis case is significant as a majority of the High Court held that in some circumstances liability could arise for failure to exercise a statutory function.\n\nwhile a statutory authority is not under a general common law duty to exercise its statutory powers, a duty could arise if the plaintiff reasonably relied upon the exercise of such a power\n\n\n\n\nCivil liability legislation and the ‘policy defence’\n\nThe legislation in all jurisdictions lists principles to be taken into account in considering whether a public authority has a duty of care and has breached its duty of care. PART 5 of CLA\n\ns 42 CLA NSW\nThe following principles apply in determining whether a public or other authority has a duty of care or has breached a duty of care in proceedings for civil liability to which this Part applies:\n\n(a) the functions required to be exercised by the authority are limited by the financial and other resources that are reasonably available to the authority for the purpose of exercising those functions,\n(b) the general allocation of those resources by the authority is not open to challenge,\n(c) the functions required to be exercised by the authority are to be determined by reference to the broad range of its activities (and not merely by reference to the matter to which the proceedings relate),\n(d) the authority may rely on evidence of its compliance with the general procedures and applicable standards for the exercise of its functions as evidence of the proper exercise of its functions in the matter to which the proceedings relate\n\n\n\n\nRoads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales v Refrigerated Roadways Pty Ltd [2009] NSWCA 263\n\nFacts\n\nMr Evans, an employee of Refrigerated Roadways Pty Ltd was killed while driving a truck along a highway when a concrete block was dropped from an overhead bridge onto his front windshield\nThe Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales (RTA) knew of the problem of people dropping material onto vehicles from overhead bridges and had developed a priority system to screen many bridges in New South Wales.\nMany bridges had already been screened but not yet the one at which the deceased was killed.\n\n\nThe issue in this case was whether the RTA had been negligent in failing to screen the overhead bridge under which Mr Evans was killed.\n\nadopted the essentially common law approach of identifying the ‘risk of harm’ against which the plaintiff alleged the RTA was negligent for failing to take precautions.\n\n\nHeld\n\nThe New South Wales Court of Appeal held that although the RTA owed a duty of care to road users to prevent reasonable harm, this duty had not been breached\n\n\n\n\nSo, s 42, and its equivalents in other jurisdictions, will be taken into account in an overall determination as to whether the response of the authority was a reasonable response to the risk.\n\n\nKempsey Shire Council v Five Star Medical Centre Pty Ltd (2018) 99 NSWLR 98 and Weber v Greater Hume Shire Council (2019) 100 NSWLR 1\n\nhas been held to preclude breach on the grounds that a budgetary allocation by a statutory authority could have been made differently.\nFacts\n\nIn Five Star, the council had fenced an airfield with 4 kilometres of fence, approximately 1.8 metres high and was aware that this fencing did not adequately prevent kangaroos and stock from gaining access to the airport.\nA plane operated by Five Star Medical Centre struck a kangaroo and was damaged. A claim was brought against the council for the cost of the repairs.\n\n\nHeld\n\nthe court supported the council as not having available resources to improve the already quite extensive fencing, ‘without reducing funds allocated to other works and purposes’ ([64]).\n\n\n\n\nEstablishing a common law duty of care\n\nPyrenees Shire Council v Day (1998) 192 CLR 330 is a rare example of a High Court decision which held an authority to be liable in negligence for failing to exercise a discretionary power\n\nFacts\n\nIn that case, in 1988 a fire destroyed some premises and damaged a fish and chip shop owned by the Days.\nThe fire had escaped from next door, from a fireplace in which the neighbour Mr Stamatopoulos had lit a log fire before he went to bed. The chimney of the fireplace was defective. The Country Fire Authority had notified the Pyrenees Shire Council that the fireplace was unsafe.\nThe council inspected the fireplace and wrote to the tenants advising that it should not be used and requiring it to be repaired. The council had the power to remedy the defect itself. The Stamatopouloses were not informed of the letter when they bought the premises.\n\n\nThe High Court held that the council had a duty to take steps to avoid the damage\n\n‘the existence of a discretion to exercise a power is not necessarily inconsistent with a duty to exercise it’\n\n\nFirst, the council failed to notify the owners of the adjoining property of the risk of the fire hazard (they sent the notice only to the previous tenants).\nSecondly, the council failed to exercise its quite extensive statutory powers to ensure that the notice, once issued to the tenants, was complied with.\nHeld\n\nthe majority of the court rejected the concept of a general test to establish a duty of care in situations where statutory authorities failed to exercise discretionary powers. The court rejected the concept of general reliance developed by Mason J in Sutherland Shire Council v Heyman (1985) 157 CLR 424.\nany duty of care to which an authority may be subject will vary according to the circumstances known to the authority and the extent of the statutory powers granted to the authority\nBrennan CJ (in dissent) expressed a view that where a power is for the benefit of the public generally, no duty can be imposed.\n\n\n\n\nCrimmins v Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee (1999) 200 CLR 1\n\nThe appellant, Mrs Maureen Crimmins, brought the action as the widow and executrix of the estate of Brian John Crimmins, who died from the lung disease mesothelioma which is caused by the inhalation of asbestos fibres, and is inevitably fatal.\nFacts\n\nMr Crimmins was a waterside worker, and it was contended that the authority was in breach of the duty of care that it owed to him to protect him from the harmful effects of asbestos dust and that that breach was one of the existing ‘liabilities and obligations of the Authority’.\nThe authority had not employed Mr Crimmins but allocated work on the waterfront and had responsibility for safety on the waterfront in the years before his death.\n\n\nIn Crimmins the issue in the High Court was whether the statutory authority owed the deceased a common law duty of care.\n\nThe court examined the circumstances in which a statutory authority will come under a duty to take affirmative action to protect a person who may suffer harm if the authority does not act\n\n\nHeld\n\nThe High Court held that the statutory authority owed a duty of care to provide safe working conditions to Mr Crimmins; however, each member of the court delivered a separate judgment with little commonality amongst the judgments.\nwhat distinguished the functions of the authority was that if the functions were not exercised, then the industry which was uniquely organised, would hardly have been able to function at all, or with any degree of\nThe authority in Crimmins had unique control over the allocation of work to waterside workers, the conditions of work, and the conduct of both workers and employers – meaning that the relationship between the authority and the employees was special – the workers were vulnerable, they were casual workers with relatively weak bargaining power.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHerridge Parties v Electricity Networks Corporation (t/as Western Power) [2021] WASCA 11\n\n[A]ny common law duty must be coherent and consistent with the relevant statutory scheme and compatible with the powers conferred and the duties imposed on the statutory authority’ (\nFurther holding that the discharge of this duty which required Western Power to periodically inspect point of attachment poles and that this was not inconsistent with s 25 of the Electricity Act 1945 (WA\n\n\nA list of relevant factors at common law\n\nMcHugh J, in both Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd v Ryan and in Crimmins v Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee, provides a list of matters which the court must take into account to determine whether a duty of care should be imposed on a public authority: Public authority list duty of care list\n\n\n\nWould a reasonable public authority reasonably foresee that its acts or omissions, including a failure to exercise its statutory powers, might result in an injury to the plaintiff or his or her interests?\n\n\n\n\nWas the authority in a position to control the situation which brought about harm?\n\n\n\n\nWas the injured person vulnerable?\n\n\n\n\nDid the authority know or ought it to have known of an existing risk of harm to the plaintiff or the class of persons who included the plaintiff?\n\n\n\n\nWould the imposition of a duty of care impose liability with respect to the defendant’s core policy-making or quasi-legislative functions?\n\n\n\n\nIs there any policy reason which denies a duty of care?\n\n\n\n\nMcHugh J suggests that if the first four of these questions are answered in the affirmative and the fifth and sixth questions in the negative, the court would ordinarily hold that the authority owed a duty of care to the plaintiff.\nAmaca Pty Ltd v New South Wales (2004) 132 LGERA 309 provides a useful overview of the High Court authority and states (Summarizing Pyreness, Crimmins, Graham Barclay, and Sutherland Shire principle)\n\n(a) The totality of the relationship between the parties is the proper basis for the determination of a duty of care;\n(b) The category of control that may contribute to the existence of a duty of care to exercise statutory powers includes control, generally of any situation that contains within it a risk of harm to others;\n(c) A duty of care does not arise merely because an authority has statutory powers, the exercise of which might prevent harm to others;\n(d) The existence of statutory powers and the mere prior exercise of those powers from time to time do not alone create a duty to exercise those powers in the future;\n(e) Knowledge that harm may result from a failure to exercise statutory powers is not itself sufficient to create a duty of care.

French CJ did not find it necessary to comment on when a common law duty will be owed by a statutory authority.

He suffered serious injuries\nFacts\n\nMr Meyers argued that the authorities had negligently failed to exercise contractual or statutory powers that, if properly exercised under the Domestic Animals Act 2000 (ACT), would have resulted in the dogs being seized and impounded after they had attacked another man two months earlier.\nTwo months before his attack another visitor was attacked by the dogs, but not harmed. Mr Meyers complained to Domestic Animal Services (DAS) who knew of the danger posed by the dogs.\n\n\nThe ACT Court of Appeal applied s 112 of the Civil Law (Wrongs) Act 2002 and held that the section prevented Mr Meyer from suing.\nthree important important observations of s 44 NSW CLA (equivalent)\n\nStanding to sue\n\nto sue a public authority for negligence, a plaintiff must have a specific, distinct interest or be affected differently than the general public.\nThe purpose is to prevent indiscriminate lawsuits against public authorities by individuals who do not have a specific or special interest in the matter.\nEstablished a test for liability\n\n\nImports a public law test\n\nAn authority may be required to exercise a discretionary power in a particular way if choosing not to do so would be legally unreasonable.\n\nIn such cases, a mandamus (a court order) can compel the exercise of this power, even though it is nominally discretionary.\n\n\nThe term “required” in s 44 is meant to reflect public law principles, aiming to prevent the imposition of a common law duty to take positive action in situations where it would limit the decision-making freedom granted by the statute.\n\nSection 44 precludes a right to compensation for a refusal to act that is an otherwise lawful and valid decision under the statute.\n\n\nIn cases where a claim is based on a failure to exercise a power to regulate or prohibit an activity, Section 112 would exclude liability, unless a court could have compelled the exercise of that power in accordance with public law principles.\n\n\nDistinguishing Mr Meyer’s case from Pyrenees\n\nEven if s 44 of the Wrongs Act doesn’t apply, the exercise of powers under the Domestic Animals Act in this particular case couldn’t have been compelled based on public law principles and the specific factual circumstances.\nThis inability to compel action is a key aspect of the relationship between the authorities and Mr. Meyers as the plaintiff.\n\nThe existence of a discretionary power to manage a risk does not automatically create a common law duty to act.\n\n\nTo establish a duty to take positive action, one must look beyond the mere presence of discretionary power.\n\nIn Mr. Meyers’ case, the relationship with the authorities was not characterized by their involvement in risk-producing activities, an assumed responsibility, or the possession of special knowledge, which are factors that could otherwise imply a duty of care.\n\n\n\n\nFollowing Meyer’s case the courts require a plaintiff to prove that a public law remedy such as mandamus would have been available\n\n\nAlthough in New South Wales in Warren Shire Council v Kuehne [2012] NSWCA 81\n\nWhealy JA took a less restrictive view and held that the plaintiff would not be required to demonstrate that he would have succeeded in an application for administrative relief\nbut rather that ‘s 44 is concerned with the issue of standing, rather than the issue as to whether a particular plaintiff would succeed on the merits in proceedings instituted alleging failure of an authority to exercise or to consider exercising a function to prohibit or regulate an activity’ ([150]).\n\n\nRickard v Allianz Australia Insurance Ltd [2009] NSWSC 1115\n\nA sigle judge of the Supreme Court, Hoeben J, found that the RTA could not rely on s 44 of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW).\nThis was because the erection of a ‘Water Over Road’ sign by the RTA did not constitute an action to ‘prohibit or regulate’ an activity as envisaged by s 44\nHis Honour observed ‘Words such [as] “prohibit” and “regulate” have meanings which do not encompass the concept of “warning”’ (at [130]) and thus, as the ‘Water Over Road’ sign was a warning it was not covered by the section.\n\n\n\n\nNegligent acts and statutory authorities\n\nIn any action against a statutory authority – for the negligent exercise of a function or for negligently omitting to exercise a function – all elements of negligence must be made out\nExamples of cases where statutory authorities have been held to owe an established duty of care include:\n\nwhere the authority acts as an occupier (see Chapter 8 and cases such as Nagle v Rottnest Island Authority (1993) 177 CLR 423);\nnegligent misstatements which cause pure economic loss (see Chapter 17 and cases such as in L Shaddock &amp;

and\n(b) civil liability will not arise unless the authority’s act or omission was so ‘unreasonable’ that no authority having the special statutory power in question could properly consider the act or omission to be a reasonable exercise\n\n\nWhat is a ‘special statutory power’?\n\nSpecial statutory powers def\n\nare those conferred under statute and of a kind not generally authorised by persons to exercise, for example, powers which deprive persons of liberty or special powers of entry addressed in Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales v Refrigerated Roadways Pty Ltd [2009] NSWCA 26\nDifferentiating ownership vs special statutory powers\n\nHis Honour observed that the exercise of a statutory power will be special when it is one which the RTA has but which ordinary citizens lack and while in this case an ordinary citizen would not be legally free to fence the bridge themselves, this was because of other legal barriers such as trespass to land and statutory controls such as environmental legislation rather than any special statutory power of the RTA\n\n\n\n\nCurtis v Harden Shire Council [2014] NSWCA 31\n\nFacts\n\nThe Harden Shire Council was carrying out roadwork and the plaintiff argued that it was negligent in failing to erect adequate signage warning of the state of the road resulting in her running off the road causing the death of her partner.\n\n\nThe court held that such signs were ‘prescribed traffic control devices’ under the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999 (NSW) and because they must be installed by a public authority, exercise of a special statutory power was involved, thereby enlivening s 43A\n\n\n\n\nWhat is certain is that a special statutory power will arise where:\n\n\n\nthere is a conferral upon an authority of a legislative power granted to that authority alone; and\n\n\n\n\nwhich may only be acted upon by that authority; and\n\n\n\n\nwhere the authority is not subject to alternate common law or statutory legal powers or restrictions or competing jurisdictions with another authority\n\n\n\n\nWednesbury unreasonableness\n\nThe Wednesbury test, originating from the UK case Associated Provincial Picture Houses v.

His vehicle aquaplaned and collided with an oncoming vehicle outside a property known as ‘Lyntods’.\nMr Kelly and his front seat passenger (Mr Dennison) were killed. Mr Kelly’s rear seat passenger (Mr Wheeler) and the driver of the other vehicle (Mr Rickard) were seriously injured.

Allianz appealed.\n\nThe subjective approach to the issue of the reasonableness of the authority’s conduct was rejected on appeal.\n\n\nThe New South Wales Court of Appeal held that while the placement of the sign ‘may not objectively have been the preferable or correct course, … it [was] comprehensible’\n\nThe court concluded that the authority’s failure was not ‘so unreasonable that no authority having the RTA’s special statutory power to erect warning signs could properly consider it to be a reasonable exercise of that power’\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarren Shire Council v Kuehne [2012] NSWCA 81,\n\nthe defendant council’s appeal succeeded55 on the basis of s 43A of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW).\nFacts\n\nThe plaintiffs were the father and brother of a four-year-old child who was tragically attacked and killed by some ‘hunting dogs’ (owned by Wilson) in the backyard of a residential property to which the child had somehow gained access.\nThe plaintiffs, who suffered psychiatric injuries, sued the council in negligence, claiming that the council knew (through its officers, following complaints made by neighbours) that the dogs were dangerous and that it negligently failed to make a declaration to that effect and to seize the dogs under the Companion Animals Act 1998 (NSW) s 34\n\n\nHeld\n\nThe sporadic and infrequent nature of the complaints could have been reasonably dealt with, as they in fact were, by approaches being made to Mr Wilson and fines being issued to him on occasions when his dogs were roaming the streets.\n\n\n\n\nagain considered and applied in Mansfield v Great Lakes Council [2016] NSWCA 204\n\nFacts\n\nand again it served to protect the public authority from liability. There the council was the authority responsible for the road culvert on which the plaintiff was injured and council employees had occasionally inspected it but only from a moving car.\nOn appeal it was held that the evidence did not satisfy the court that the failure of the council to replace the culvert was an omission ‘so unreasonable’ that no roads authority could properly consider the omission to be a reasonable failure to exercise its statutory powers\n\n\nThe Court of Appeal held that s 43A required the plaintiff to prove that the inspections and the council’s ignorance of the danger were so manifestly unreasonable that no council acting properly could have failed to identify the circumstances calling for action\n\n\nRoad Maritime Services v Grant [2015] NSWCA 138, s 43A was again successfully applied in favour of a statutory authority, but here with respect to an omission to act.\n\nIn that case Mr Grant was injured in a motorcycle accident in Lane Cove (Sydney, NSW) where his motorcycle collided with the nose of a concrete median strip. The plaintiff argued that if the road authority had installed a ‘Keep Left’ sign on the median strip, road users would have been alerted to the presence of the median strip and his accident could have been avoided.\nThe court agreed that the RMS decision not to erect a ‘Keep Left’ sign constituted an exercise of a special statutory power, however, denied the plaintiff’s claim due to the high threshold for breach in s 43A\n\n\n\n\ns 43 and the tort of breach of statutory duty\n\nSection 43 applies only to actions for breach of statutory duty,57 a cause of action separate from the tort of negligence\ns 43 imposes a ‘Wednesbury unreasonableness’ standard where a public authority is sued in an action for breach of statutory duty in connection with the exercise of or a failure to exercise a function.\nwhether an authority can be liable for an act or omission relating to exercise of a special statutory power\n\n\n\n\n\n14.3.14 Part 5: Liability of public and other authorities\n\n‘Public or other authority’ def\n\ns 41:\n\nthe Crown, government departments, public health organisations, local councils, authorities constituted by or under an Act, but also prescribed persons or bodies or classes thereof\n\n\ns 42 sets out ‘principles’ to be applied in ‘determining whether a public authority has a duty of care or has breached a duty of care’. Courts must consider:\n\n(a) that the functions required to be exercised by the authority are limited by the financial and other resources … available to the authority …;\n(b) the general allocation of resources … is not open to challenge;\n(c) the functions required to be exercised by the authority are to be determined by reference to the broad range of its activities …;\n(d) the authority may rely on evidence of its compliance with the general procedures and applicable standards for the exercise of its functions as evidence of the proper exercise.\n\n\nIn Romeo v Conservation Commission of the Northern Territory (1998) 192 CLR 431,\n\nKirby J referred to the fact that the courts had previously ‘accepted that budgetary, political and other constraints within which such authorities must operate are factors to be taken into account in determining the scope of the duty of care and whether in a particular case it has been breached’\n\n\ns 43A deals with negligence liability in respect of the exercise of ‘special statutory powers’ defined in the section as power conferred by statute, and that is of a kind that persons generally are not authorised to exercise without statutory authority.\ns 44 is obviously aimed at significantly limiting the circumstances in which a duty of care may be imposed on a statutory authority requiring it to carry out a particular function.

If volition is in issue, does the plaintiff have to prove the defendant’s act was voluntary, or does the defendant have to prove it was involuntary?\n\nVolition refers to a person’s ability to act voluntarily. It’s about whether the defendant’s bodily movement was a result of their conscious control.\nIntention relates to the purpose or desire behind the act. It concerns whether the defendant meant to bring about certain consequences or effects of the action, or if they knew with substantial certainty that those effects would result\nSo, if volition is in issue:\n\nThe plaintiff has to prove that there was a direct interference with their person (e.g., a touch)\nThe defendant then has the burden of showing that the act was involuntary.\n\n\n\n\nWill establishing a trespass be enough by itself to engage s 3B(1)(a) of the Civil Liability Act? Why or why not?\n\nClaim against police for assault and trespass to land intentional act … at least done with intent to injure, will take the matter outside the operation of the Civil Liability Act, by virtue of s 3B(1)(a)’\ndoes not exclude intentional torts.\nFor s 3B(1)(a) to be engaged, the intentional act must be done with the intent to cause injury or death, or involve sexual assault or other sexual misconduct. Simply proving trespass does not, by itself, engage this provision. The intent behind the act must also be established.\n\n\nFor the purposes of s 3B(1)(a), will recklessness (rather than an actual intention to injure) establish an “intent to cause injury”? Should recklessness establish an intent to cause harm?\n\nmerely being reckless, without a specific intent to cause harm, might not suffice to invoke s 3B(1)(a).\nMore likely a negligence tort\r\nTrespass to Person - Battery\n\n\nFor the purposes of battery, what is the act that must be intended by the Defendant and what is the nature of the intention required? Refer to Williams v Milotin to explain whether negligence is sufficient to satisfy the intent element in trespass. Which party bears the onus of proving fault?\n\nTo prove battery, each element of the tort must be made out:\n\n\n\nan intentional and voluntary positive act by the defendant\n\n\n\n\nwhich directly\n\n\n\n\ncauses contact with the body of the plaintiff\n\n\n\n\nWilliams v Milotin (1957) 97 CLR 465 established that trespass to person by battery may be committed by a negligent act.\n\nNegligent conduct would satisfy the elements of the tort of assault, another trespass to person tort.\n\n\nonce the plaintiff proves that there was a direct interference with their person (like a physical contact), the onus or burden then shifts to the defendant to demonstrate that the act was involuntary.\n\n\nTo what extent is the element of hostility relevant in an action for battery?\nConsider the case of Scott v Shepherd. Do you agree with the reasoning of the Courts in this case on the issue of whether the ‘directness’ requirement was satisfied?\n\nIntentional conduct in trespass encompasses deliberate, reckless or negligent actions.\n\nIt is not necessary that the intent of the defendant should be hostile and it need not include an intent to injure or harm the plaintiff.\n\n\nHutchins v Maughan [1947] VLR 131, 13\nelement of directness is satisfied where the contact ‘follows so immediately upon the act of the defendant that it may be termed part of that act’.\ntrespass is based on direct interference whereas case is based on indirect or consequential interference.\n\n\nA mother was holding her 12-month-old baby when the defendant punched her in the face, causing her to drop her baby. Has a battery been committed:\r\n(a) by the defendant against the mother? - yes, clearly positive voluntary contact w/o consent\n(b) by the defendant against the baby? - yes, case (trespass on the case, aka negligence tort) is based on indirect or consequential interference. Hutchins v Maughan [1947] VLR 131, 13\n(c) by the mother against the baby? - no, all contact between them is consentual, No intention, involuntary action.\nNote: these were the facts of Haystead v Chief Constable of Derbyshire [2000] 3 All ER 890.\n\nAssault\n\nHow does the tort of assault differ from battery?\n\nAssault thus refers to the threat of force, and battery refers to the actual use of the force.\n\n\nWhy is the knowledge of the plaintiff in a case of assault essential?\n\nFor assault to occur, the plaintiff must be aware of the threat so that they can genuinely apprehend the imminent contact.\nDifferentiate from battery\nMeasurable to the reasonable person\n\n\nCritically examine the view that words alone do not constitute assault. Refer to Barton v Armstrong. Since the tort of assault is essentially concerned with threats, why is this an issue?\n\nBarton v Armstrong [1969] 2 NSWR 451,\n\nArmstrong threatened over the telephone, to take Barton’s life if he did not sign a deed.\n\nNever said when, but seemingly imminent\n\n\nCaused fear for life\n\n\n\n\nWhat must the defendant intend? Can an assault be committed negligently?\n\ndefendant must subjectively intend to create in the plaintiff an apprehension of imminent physical contact.\n\nEven if not able to harm, such as unloaded gun\n\n\nMacMasters, can be negligently\n\n\nWhat must the plaintiff apprehend? Is this determined subjectively or objectively?\n\nProof of assault requires proof of an intention to create in another person an apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact;\nJudged objectively even though the offense is subjective\n\n\n\nFalse imprisonment\n\n‘False imprisonment, a trespass, does not lie unless the defendant directly and intentionally caused the plaintiff’s bodily restraint. If done negligently, like carelessly locking someone inside a library or freezer, the plaintiff must prove actual injury to be successful in his or her action.’ Fleming, The Law of Torts, 8th Ed, 1992, at 30. Do you agree with this view? Why?\n\ndefendant’s act must be intentional\nNegligently\n\nlocking up of a library by a security worker, where a person remains inside, unknown to the security worker.\nMust sue under tort of negligence then prove damage\n\n\n\n\nTo what extent is knowledge of confinement essential in an action for false imprisonment?\n\nDuration of false imprisonment\n\nAny form of deprivation of liberty is sufficient, even if it is only for a short period of time.\nExceptions in the implied rule for police/transport authority\n\n\nKnowledge of the deprivation\n\nMeering v Grahame-White Aviation Co (1919\n\nEmployee did not know there were detectives stationed outside the room to prevent him from leaving\nHeld to be false imprisonment\n\n\nHart v Herron (1984) Aust Torts Reps\n\ndeep sleep therapy and electroconvulsive treatment, to which he had not consented.\nfalse imprisonment even though the plaintiff was unconscious at the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass Problems\n\n\nProblem Question 1\n\nBrett had been to the cinema for a ‘babes in arms’ showing of Jane Campion’s brilliant The Power of the Dog. After quite a restless few hours in the cinema, Jane - his baby daughter - had finally fallen asleep on the drive home. So as not to disturb her, when he arrived home he parked in the driveway, with all the windows down, and Jane asleep in the baby capsule in the rear seat.\nMay stole the car not noticing the child in the rear seat. After driving some way and hearing baby Jane’s cries, May abandoned the car in an area of bushland some kilometres away. The car and Jane were not found for 12 hours. When found, Jane was hungry and dehydrated but otherwise apparently unharmed.\nDoes Jane have an action in tort against May?\n\nI - Identify the issues raised by the problem\n\nJane v May (False imprisonment) - stealing car and abandoning baby\nTheft of vehicle\n\ntort of conversion or trespass to chattel\ntaking with the intent of exercising over the chattel an ownership inconsistent with the real owner’s right of possession”.\n\n\nFalse imprisonment\n\nTotal deprivation of liberty\nBegan as unintentional, once aware became intentional - fagan\n\nAbandoned baby\n\n\n\n\nNegligence\n\n\nR - Research/ review the relevant law\n\ntheft of vehicle\n\ntort of conversion or trespass to chattel\ntaking with the intent of exercising over the chattel an ownership inconsistent with the real owner’s right of possession”.\n\n\nFalse imprisonment\n\nTotal deprivation of liberty\nBegan as unintentional, once aware became intentional - fagan\nMeering v Grahame-White Aviation Co (1919\n\nDid not know it was false imprisonment, does not matter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA - Apply/ Argue the law\n\nMay could be held liable for conversion because she unlawfully took Brett’s car, thus denying him his property rights.\nOnce May became aware of Jane’s presence in the car and failed to act, her actions (or inactions) could constitute false imprisonment.\nForeseeable risk to leave a baby alone for any amount of time\n\n\nC - Conclude as to how a court might rule on the issue.\n\nConsidering the evidence and applicable laws, a court would likely find May liable for several torts, including conversion, false imprisonment, reckless endangerment, and negligence. Given the clear chain of events and the harm caused, it’s probable that damages would be awarded in favor of Jane (and potentially her guardians).\nJudge would smack may around, hard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem Question 2\n\nIn the shadow of the climate crisis, and in response to Greta Thunberg’s global mobilisation of young people, university student bodies across Sydney have united to co-ordinate city, state, and countrywide action. To launch this new initiative, and to acknowledge the global success of the Friday school strikes initiated by Thunberg, the University Coalition for Climate Justice (UCCJ) organise a state wide strike of young people. The strike day is designed to coincide with an important speech that is scheduled to be given by the State Minister for Energy and the Environment in Parliament on Macquarie Street.\nWhen the Minister’s car approaches Parliament, Dipesh and Justine (co-chairs of UCCJ) and a large group of students spat at the car and threw coal at it. The driver of the car, who was having difficulty negotiating a way through the protesters, was driving at about 10 kilometres an hour. Simon, an animal rights protester who has taken the demonstration as an opportunity to highlight Nike’s culling of kangaroos to make football boots, runs in front of the car waving a kangaroo shaped placard. The driver accidentally puts his foot on the accelerator instead of the brake, running Simon down.\nJustine ran to Simon’s aid but was grabbed by the arm by a member of the Parliament security team. She yelled, “Let me go, climate terrorist!” and the security personnel replied, “If you don’t get out of here, you’ll wish you hadn’t said that. How would you like to find out how a real terrorist acts?”\nWhen the Minister exits the car, a group of students are waiting. Jas and Dom, two further security personnel, barred the way of the demonstrators into Parliament. The security people simply stood still, arms crossed over their chests, saying nothing, blocking the doorway. This prevented anyone entering or leaving the building. The students outside continued to shout their disapproval of the government’s response to the climate crisis but did not try to enter the blocked doorway. They claimed that they were afraid of what the security personnel might do if they tried to enter.\nBlue, one of the students who had gone into the Parliament before the Minister arrived, tried to leave but Jas and Dom stood silently in the doorway, ignoring Blue’s requests for them to move to let them out. Blue pushes Jas in the back saying “Let me out, you thug!” Jas does not reply or move. Blue was not able to leave the building until after the Minister had delivered his speech. Security personnel similarly blocked all other exits from the building.\nAdvise all parties as to their rights and liabilities in tort.\n\nI - Identify the issues raised by the problem\n\nDipesh and Justine\n\nBattery - parliament security team\n\nLikely not pass as not excessive and in line of duty\n\n\nFalse imprisonment - helping simon\n\n\n\nMinister’s driver\n\nMinister\n\nTrespass to Chattels: students throwing things at minister car\nTrespass to goods\n\nCar damaged\n\n\n\n\nSimon\n\nCould sue for battery from drive\nNegligence: The driver has a duty to operate the vehicle with care.

Inspired by Murray Bail’s beautiful 1998 novel Eucalyptus, gum trees have come to occupy most of his garden including the boundary with his neighbour, Artemesia. Artemesia has long complained of the impact of the trees on her garden and house, where they obstruct light and shed leaves on her land. As a professional artist she particularly objects to the loss of light. As the trees have grown, relations have deteriorated and Artemesia finally takes matters into her own hands. One Saturday afternoon she climbs on to the boundary fence and up into one of the Sydney blue gum trees with a saw. David eventually hears her sawing at the tree and comes out. As he stands looking up at Artemesia initially speechless, Artemesia calls down: ‘Don’t come any closer or you’ll be next with this saw!’\n\n\nAdvise the parties as to their possible liabilities in torts.\n\nArtemisia:\n\nCan sue trespass so long as the defendant directly causes some object to come into contact with the property such as leaves, branches\n\nwhere a defendant causes a bulldozer to move soil or rocks onto the plaintiff’s property (Watson v Cowan [1959] Tas SR 194)\nor allows cattle to go on the plaintiff’s land (Yakamia Dairy Pty Ltd v Wood [1976] WAR 57; Lade &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Black [2005] QSC 325)\nGregory v Piper\n\n\n\n\nDavid\n\nCan sue trespass to chattel\nCan sue for assault\nCan sue for trespass to land\nSouthport Corporation v Esso Petroleum Co Ltd [1954] 2 QB 182,\n\nNot the direct act of the person who spilled the oil\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem Question 2\n\nMichael and Barney own and live on an organic market farm Green Leaves on the edge of the city. It is reasonably small - approximately 8 acres - and specialises in herbs, unusual salad leaf, and Asian greens. The farm prides itself on providing organic and responsibly grown produce. It supplies many of Sydney’s top restaurants and supplies to the public through the Carriageworks Market each Saturday. The market garden is 4 kilometres from Sydney airport. The location was chosen as it allows easy access to the central Sydney customers and yet is unaffected by pollution from the airport.\nA well known Australian airline deploys the Boeing A380 on it’s Sydney to London Heathrow route. Unfortunately, last year an engine fault occurred on a flight immediately upon take off. As a result, the plane circled back to make an emergency landing. Emergency protocol required that the plane’s fuel is ejected to reduce risks on landing. Green Leaves was directly under the path of the diverted plane and caught the end of the emergency fuel dump which should have hit the ocean. The fuel has ruined crop that is ready for market, seedlings, and is likely to result in the removal of organic status while the top soil is removed and replaced. The demanding reaccreditation process is likely to take at least 2 years.\n\nLoss of income, trespass to chattels\n\n\nA number of months later, Briony, an established reporter from the international trade publication Flight, decides to stop at Michael and Barney’s home and business. Briony is an aviation journalist and is interested in the Boeing Max scandal, the failure of the A380, and the environmental impacts of aviation. She walks up to their home and knocks on the door. When Barney answers she explains that she wants to do a piece on the A380 and that the impact on Green Leaves will provide an interesting and ‘relatable’ introduction to a larger piece on Boeing. Barney explains that they are in the process of reaching a settlement with the airline and that they don’t want to disrupt negotiations. He adds that the incident has put added strain on what was already a business and relationship under stress and neither wish to be interviewed.\nBriony says she understands and asks if she could use the bathroom before getting back on the road. Barney shows her the way. While in the bathroom Briony realises that the difficulties the couple are facing only add to their value as a ‘human interest’ opener for her more technically driven article.

To what extent do the cases of Haley v London Electricity Board and Levi v Colgate Palmolive help in your understanding of this concept?\n\nUnforeseeability\n\nTheir injuries could not reasonably have been anticipated by the tortfeasor.\n\n\nA plaintiff will have to demonstrate that a reasonable person in the position of the defendant would recognise that negligent behaviour would foreseeably cause injury to another person.\nHaley v London and Levi v Colgate are circumstances that are unique to those individuals, not something one could reasonably foresee.\n\n\nRefer to the quote from Kirby J’s judgment in Harriton v Stevens (Text at p 200). His Honour says: “in so far as physical injuries arising from a positive act are concerned, it is accepted that if the reasonable foreseeability test is satisfied, the elusive additional component of a duty of care will generally exist”. His Honour does not explain why, but can you? (Note that his Honour’s use of the word “generally” accommodates exceptional cases where public policy may negate any duty, eg Shaw Savill).\n\nIf you are able to reasonably foresee that the action that you will commit will cause harm, then you owe the person that you will cause that harm a duty of care\n\n\nWhat is meant by an ‘established duty category’?

When will a defendant be liable in negligence for a “pure omission”?\n\nIt is, however, exceptional to find in the law a duty to control another’s actions to prevent harm to strangers.\nIn the Modbury case, the court confirmed the general reluctance to find a duty of care for pure omissions, unless there is some special feature or relationship that justifies such a duty.\n\n\n\nWhat is the scope of the employer’s established duty of care to the employee?

For the last 7 years she has visited her doctor sporadically and then on a more regular basis complaining of growing levels of forgetfulness, disorientation, and mood swings. Her doctor was generally dismissive and Emily too busy to take up the matter elsewhere. Six months ago, however, she was finally referred to a neurologist. Two months ago she was diagnosed with a form of dementia.\r\nEmily is aware that there is growing evidence that the repeated head traumas experienced in some sports might be associated with dementia in later in life. Emily was well know for her almost unparalleled skill heading the ball. Indeed it was something of a signature move for her.\r\nMartha, Emily’s daughter, is trying to help her mother decide whether she should pursue a legal case against either her doctor or the Australian Soccer Association.

The premises include all the facilities required to harvest grapes into wine. The area is approximately 5 hectares and is bordering on some of the more well-known wineries such as Petersons and Audrey Wilkinson and is very close to Tulloch and De Bortoli Wines in Pokolbin. There is a wine cellar large enough to allow wine tasting for visitors during opening hours. Accommodation facilities are also included as is a large restaurant and function centre. The previous owners were producing six varieties of red and five whites in a good year. They also exported several blends to China and New Zealand.\r\nThe grapes on the vines were four weeks away from being picked and George and Jillian were very excited about their first batch of wines. A winery directly adjacent to theirs called Royce wines introduced an experiment chemical called “mettle” onto their vines known to increase the yield of the crop and add a certain body to the texture of the wine. This special chemical was imported from France and has had mixed reviews. It is known to enhance red varieties but could be harmful to white varieties. Royce wines only harvests red wine. A vintner hired by Royce wines is out spraying their vines with this special chemical when the wind changes direction. A large portion of the chemical lands on George and Jillian’s vines unbeknown to them. The next day George notices a funny odour on his white grapes but thinks nothing of it.\r\nA week later George is out inspecting his crop and notices that his white grapes are discoloured. He calls in his own Vintner to inspect the crop and is told that the whole crop of white grapes has been destroyed and it’s too late to replant for this season. The total crop cannot be picked for production and must be cleared as a precautionary measure to prevent potential contamination of his red varieties. George and Jillian are very upset and ask the Vintner to conduct a chemical analysis. The Vintner reveals George and Jillian’s crop was contaminated with “Mettle” the experimental chemical used in France. The cost to George and Jillian in lost sales of white wine for this season amounts to a million dollars.\r\nDo George and Jillian have an action against anyone for the destruction of their crop and if so, does any potential defendant owe them a duty of care?\n\n\n\n\nGeorge and Jillian v Royce wines\nDuty of care\n\nDoes D owe responsibility to plaintiff? - established category - salient features\n\nIt could be argued that Royce wines or their vintner owed a duty of care to George and Jillian to ensure that their use of chemicals didn’t harm neighboring crops - Chapman v Hearse reasonable forseeability / salient features - vulnerability of plaintiff to adjacent land\nPositive act that causes physical damage (Meandarra Aerial Spraying v GEJ &amp; MA Geldard)\n\n\n\n\nBreach\n\nthe vintner spraying the “Mettle” carelessly\ninsufficient precautions were taken given the windy conditions\nReasonable vintner is the same position test - reasonable foreseability\n\n\nCausation\n\nThe mettle sprayed by vinter affected george and jillian’s crops, destroyed all white wine vines\nDid not have conversation with neighbors\n\n\nDamage\n\nThe loss of income, loss of property, potentially damaging the soil and other red wine vines\n\n\nRemoteness\n\nRecency\n\nNot in question\n\n\nChain of causation\n\nChemical analysis confirms mettle caused damage, and facts claim defendant used mettle on a windy day\nNeighboring land\n\n\n\n\nDefenses\n\ncontributory negligence / intoxication / recreational activity\n\nNot applicable\r\nNegligence II -Breach of Duty\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does s 5B of the Civil Liability Act impact breach of duty?\n\nIt is the criteria that evaluate if a duty of care has been breached\nForeseeability\nSignificance of the Risk\nReasonable Person Test\nFactors for the Reasonable Person Test\n\nProbability of Harm\nSeriousness of Harm\nBurden of Taking Precautions\nSocial Utility of the Activity\n\n\n\n\nConsider the facts of Bolton v Stone in the Text at 9.4.3. Would the case be decided the same way under the Civil Liability Act? You might refer to Shaw v Thomas here.\n\nThe House of Lords held in Bolton v Stone that the probability of a person being struck by a cricket ball outside the ground was so slight as to be almost negligible.\n\nForeseeability: Given that the ball had been hit outside of the ground on previous occasions, the risk was foreseeable.\nSignificance of the Risk: Based on the frequency of the occurrence (six times in 30 years), the risk can be argued to be insignificant.\nReasonable Person Test: Would a reasonable person have taken further precautions?\n\nProbability of Harm: As per Bolton v Stone, the probability was deemed so slight as to be almost negligible.\nSeriousness of Harm: While being hit by a cricket ball can be harmful, the combination of the rare probability with the existence of the 17-foot fence suggests that the seriousness was not so significant as to warrant additional measures.\nBurden of Taking Precautions: The cricket club already had a 17-foot net, suggesting they had taken some precautions. The burden and feasibility of adding further protective measures (e.g., a taller net) would be factors to consider.\nSocial Utility of the Activity: Cricket, being a popular sport, has significant social utility.\n\n\n\n\nVery likely that the court would have found the same argument to be persuasive\n\n\nConsider Shaw v Thomas. What did the Court decide about s 5B(1)(b)? How did the Court decide whether a reasonable person in the defendants’ position would have taken any precautions (s 5B(1)(c))? What was the significance of the Australian Safety Standards?\n\nRegarding s 5B(1)(b) - Significance of the Risk:\n\nThe Court had to decide whether the risk was not insignificant.\nGiven the severity of the injury, which included a fractured skull, and the height from which the child fell, it’s clear that the risk wasn’t insignificant.\n\n\nRegarding s 5B(1)(c) - Whether a Reasonable Person Would Have Taken Precautions:\n\nKirby J emphasized that a reasonable person in the defendants’ position would have taken precautions against removing bunk bed’s guard rail and ladder\n\n\nPerry v Harris, where it was established that documents like the Australian Safety Standards were instructive but were not the definitive tools to determine a breach of the duty of care\n\n\nRefer to Tapp. How did the majority characterise the relevant risk of harm? How was the risk characterised in the lower courts? Explain the majority’s conclusion regarding breach of duty.\nExplain the ‘calculus of negligence’ referring to relevant cases in your answer. Give one case example for each of the “calculus” factors in s 5B(2).\n\nThe ‘calculus of negligence’ is a concept that courts use to determine whether a defendant has breached a duty of care once it’s established that the risk of injury is foreseeable and not insignificant.\n\nThis calculus involves weighing various factors to determine if the defendant’s actions were reasonable in the circumstances.\n\n\ns 5B(2)(b) - Likely seriousness of the harm:\n\nCase Example: Ryan v Fisher (1976) 51 ALJR 125: The High Court emphasized the seriousness of consequences as a factor in determining negligence. If the risks inherent in the conduct have serious consequences when they eventuate, it weighs heavily in the calculus.\n\n\nComparison\n\nProbability of Harm:\n\nCalculus of Negligence: Evaluates the likelihood that the defendant’s conduct would result in harm.\ns 5B(2)(a): Explicitly considers “the probability that the harm would occur if care were not taken.”\n\n\nSeverity of Harm:\n\nCalculus of Negligence: Considers the potential seriousness of harm that might result from the defendant’s conduct.\ns 5B(2)(b): Looks at “the likely seriousness of the harm.”\n\n\nBurdens or Costs of Taking Precautions:\n\nCalculus of Negligence: Weighs the practicality and expense of taking precautions against the potential harm.\ns 5B(2)(c): Considers “the burden of taking precautions to avoid the risk of harm.”\n\n\nSocial Utility:\n\nCalculus of Negligence: Examines the societal benefits of the defendant’s conduct.\ns 5B(2)(d): Evaluates “the social utility of the activity that creates the risk of harm.”\n\n\ndifference lies in their origins and application.\n\nThe calculus of negligence is a common-law doctrine that has evolved through judicial decisions over time\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a reasonably foreseeable risk and how is a ‘not insignificant’ risk different?\n\nA risk which is not far-fetched or fanciful is real and therefore, foreseeable.\nShaw v Thomas [2010] NSWCA 16\r\n- held that the ‘not insignificant’ test was more demanding than the common law test of ‘not far-fetched or fanciful’ ‘but … not by very much’\r\n- reiterated in Prouten v Chapman [2021] NSWCA 207\n\nrequirement for a ‘not insignificant’ risk imposes ‘a slightly more demanding standard’ than ‘not far-fetched or fanciful’.\n\n\nReasonably foreseeable risk = potentially possible\nNot insignificant = possible -\n\nuneven cement is possible to fall, but insignificantly likely\n\n\n\n\nHow is the standard of care adjusted for professionals?\n\n(1) A person practising a profession (a professional) does not incur liability in negligence …\n\nif it is established that the professional acted in a manner that … was widely accepted in Australia by peer professional opinion as competent professional practice.\n\n\n(2) Peer professional opinion cannot be relied on …\n\nif the court considers that the opinion is irrational.\n\n\n(3) The fact that there are differing peer professional opinions widely accepted in Australia\n\n… does not prevent any one or more (or all) of those opinions being relied on.\n\n\n(4) Peer professional opinion does not have to be universally accepted to be considered widely accepted.\n\n\nApart from professionals, are there any other groups or populations where the standard of care is adjusted to take account of their characteristics?

She is also a Visiting Medical Officer at the Bloomsbury District Hospital where she operates regularly. Leonard is a private patient who had a severe shoulder injury as a result of a fall during parkour training. The shoulder was repaired by Orlando under general anaesthetic at the Bloomsbury District Hospital.\r\nVanessa, another surgeon and the Head of the orthopaedic unit, asked Orlando if, whilst Leonard was under general anaesthetic, a number of her medical students might ‘practice’ certain examination procedures on several of Leonard’s joints. Without seeking permission, Orlando agreed and four students were allowed to perform external examinations involving touching, moving, and extending Leonard’s ankle, knee, and hip joints. Leonard was unaware of this until he was told several days later by Virginia, a student nurse who was in the theatre at the time. Leonard complained to the hospital administration.\r\nPrior to the surgery, Orlando had told Leonard that he should have full movement in the shoulder afterwards. Medical evidence is that if he had not had the surgery his shoulder would have improved with time, but would never recover the full range of movement. Orlando warned Leonard of various risks associated with this type of surgery which might result in the slight restriction of movement in future. She did not warn him of a rare but known complication of the surgery which might result in a droop of his shoulder with pain and severe restriction of movement. This complication eventuated through no negligence on the part of Orlando in performing the surgery.\r\nLeonard says that if he had known of the possibility of such a complication he might have considered not having the surgery at all. He says he certainly would have waited to see if his shoulder healed sufficiently on its own.\r\nVirginia, the student nurse, is not popular with the medical students because of her actions. Roger and Lytton, two resident doctors employed by the hospital, take Virginia to the hospital morgue where there are two bodies openly visible. They lock her in the morgue. This is a familiar practical ‘joke’ at the hospital and the hospital administration are aware that it happens occasionally. The hospital has warned against the practice but have taken no other action to prevent it. Virginia was severely distressed by the experience. She was locked in the morgue for over an hour and has left the hospital because of the experience and its impact.\n\nOrlando\n\nDefense against leonard claims:\n\nDuty of care\n\nDoes D owe responsibility to plaintiff? - established category - salient features\nEstablished category surgeon\n\n\nBreach\n\nDid not ask for permission to have students touch him - battery - vanessa and students\nDid not inform patient of negligable risk\n\n\nCausation\n\nStudents manipulated him while under - vanessa and students\nPatient may have waited if they had known\n\n\nDamage\n\nShoulder is injured due to surgery\nLeonard was touched without permission while under - battery - vanessa and students\n\n\nRemoteness\n\nRecency\nChain of causation\nNot in question\n\n\nDefenses\n\ncontributory negligence / intoxication / recreational activity\n\nTouching patient without consent is not likely to be justifiable - vanessa and students\nOrlando\n\nNo directness\n\n\n\n\nRogers v Whitaker\n\nHas to be aware that the patient would attach significance to the small chance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeonard\n\nCan sue for recklessness of the dr, breach of duty of care for allowing students to touch and move him without consent, and battery\nCan sue for breach of duty not informing him of that risk, however may or may not be likely to win unless he informed dr that that info was significant\n\nSection 5P of the New South Wales Act\n\n\n\n\nVirginia\n\nCan sue for tort of false imprisonment\n\n\n\nan intentional positive voluntary act of the defendant\n\n\n\n\ndirectly causing\n\n\n\n\nThe total deprivation of the liberty of the plaintiff.\n\n\n\n\nNegligence\nPsychological harm\n\n\nHospital\n\nWill be sued for negligence\n\nbreach of duty towards victoria\nvicarious liability orlando\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem Question 2\r\nJustin is a student at Middle Bay Private school. He is in year 5 and has two brothers who also attend the school. Justin normally brings his lunch to school but today he decides to buy it from the school canteen. The lunch special of the day is his favourite, spaghetti bolognaise. He tucks in and so do many of his friends some of whom order a large portion because it’s so tasty. Several hours later, Justin is feeling unwell and decides to skip dinner. He experiences severe stomach pains and vomits on several occasions. He mother is very worried about him and takes him to the hospital where he is diagnosed with food poisoning. He is admitted and is treated that evening. Justin goes home the next day but continues to experience ongoing stomach cramps for weeks. His GP diagnosed him with chronic diverticulitis caused from food poisoning. It appears upon investigation by the school that the mince used by the school canteen that day had passed its use-by date. Justin’s friends who also enjoyed spaghetti that day also experienced stomach cramps but not to the same extent as Justin. Friends in his group who didn’t partake in the lunch special had no health issues at all.\r\nJustin’s younger brother Tristian who is in year 3 is a very energetic child. He loves playing on the school swings but is only allowed to do so when a teacher is supervising. At lunch time a teacher is always on playground duty and often stands close by the swings to supervise. The school has a strict “hands off” policy which means children must not touch each other. Tristian was playing on the school swings under the watchful eye of Monica, the teacher on playground duty. Just when Tristian was on the swings, Monica was briefly distracted by a scream from another student who was pushed over onto the ground. Monica raced over to see if she was okay. In the meantime, two other students reached over and pushed Tristian off the swings whilst he was in mid-flight. He bumped his head on the concrete paving and passed out. The ambulance was called, and he was rushed to hospital where he suffered concussion and haemorrhaging on the brain. He was placed into induced coma. A month later he still cannot walk and will be confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life.\r\nJustin’s older brother Sabastian is in year 6 and attends the school swimming carnival which is an all-day event. He a is a very good swimmer and was awarded several prizes last year for his excellence in the pool. He hopes to repeat that performance this year. The carnival is held in the school which has a 50-metre pool. Backstroke is his most successful style. The school uses mobile removable steps which are attached to the inside of the pool allowing easy egress. Sabastian enters his first race of the day and is leading the field. When he was just about to touch the other end of the pool on his first lap, he smashes into the mobile steps which were placed there in the previous event to allow a student to leave the pool mid race. Sabastian is in a lot of pain and is taken to hospital where is treated for two fractured ribs and a broken elbow. He also hit his head on the stairs and has damaged his spin. Doctors inform his parents that may never walk properly again and may be confined to a wheelchair for a period before needing a walking trolley.\r\nDo Justin, Tristian and Sabastian have an action against anyone for the injuries they sustained? Outline if you think a duty of care is owed by any nominated defendant and whether this duty has been breached. You must refer to any relevant sections of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) and any relevant case law.\r\nJustin\n\nDuty of care to student, negligence in food preparation, breached duty of care and caused damage\r\nTristan\nDuty of care to student on property, negligence on the school for not having enough teachers to support students.

However, in a novel case, the [provision] made it incumbent on the court to explicitly consider and explain, in terms of legal policy, whether or not, and if so why, responsibility for the harm should be imposed on the negligent party”. How did the normative question arise in Buljat and how was it resolved (or in other words, what precedent did the case establish)?\n\nRuled against a customer who sustained injuries after slipping on grape in a Public Liability case.\n\nOriginally The Court held that although there was evidence that the floor had not been cleaned for six and half hours.\n\nIt was enough for employees to keep a proper lookout and simply clean as they go.\n\n\nThe Court held on appeal that there ought to have been at least some system which required staff to specifically identify and eliminate hazards.\n\nThe system needs to be adequate and there must be some evidence as to its effectiveness to protect customers.\nat least once an hour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider the case of Performance Cars v Abraham (Text at p 320). Do you think the plaintiff in that case would have succeeded under s 5D(2)? Why or why not?\n\nGiven the above, it’s arguable that the harm (the need for respraying) would have occurred even without the defendant’s negligence. Under s 5D(2), the court would consider the situation subjectively, taking into account all relevant circumstances.\nConsidering the English Court of Appeal’s decision that the defendant ‘takes the plaintiff as he finds him’, and the fact that the car already needed a respray, it’s plausible to conclude that the plaintiff might face challenges succeeding under s 5D(2). The defendant could argue that their negligence did not change the outcome for the plaintiff – the car would have required a respray regardless.\n\n\nWhat is a novus actus interveniens?\n\nMonaghan Surveyors Pty Ltd v Stratford Glen-Avon Pty Ltd [2012] NSWCA 94\n\nNovus actus interveniens\nA situation in which the later act severed the causal link between the defendant’s negligence and the plaintiff’s damage,\n\nIf an event is found by the court to have severed the causal link between the defendant’s negligent act and the plaintiff’s loss, then the court may decide that the defendant should not be liable for the damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor each of the following descriptions of an intervening act, cite an authority and what it decided:\r\n(a) a negligent act of the plaintiff following the defendant’s negligence;\nMarch v E &amp; MH Stramare Pty Ltd (1991) 171 CLR 506.\nplaintiff was injured when a truck owned by the defendant was parked illegally and obstructed the vision of the plaintiff, who was driving a car.\r\n(b) a deliberate act of the plaintiff following the defendant’s negligence;\r\nHaber v walker\r\n(c) a criminal act of the plaintiff following the defendant’s negligence;\nHunter area health v presland\n\nLet out from mental wardl\nWent and killed sister in law\r\n(d) a negligent act of a third person following the defendant’s negligence (generally);\n\n\nStrong v Woolworths Ltd [2012] HCA 5.\n\nThe court had to determine whether Woolworths was liable for the plaintiff’s injuries, given that the immediate cause of the harm was the negligent act of an unidentified third person who left the chip on the floor.\n\n\nChapman v hearse\r\n(e) a negligent act of a medical practitioner following the defendant’s negligence;\nMahony v J Kruschich\n\nExacebated treatment, inexcusibly bad treatment sue original\r\n(f) a subsequent negligent failure of another professional to do what the defendant professional also failed to do;\n\n\nBennet v minister\nTabet v Gett [2010] HCA 12.\n\nThe High Court held that while Dr. Gett was negligent in not ordering the CT scan earlier, the plaintiff failed to prove, on the balance of probabilities, that the earlier detection would have resulted in a better outcome.

She collects a load of heavy steel joists which are to be delivered to a building site in North Sydney. Because she is in a hurry, she neglects to fasten the restraining straps over her load, leaving the joists loose on the back of the truck. While driving along Pacific Highway, she drives over a pothole and the sudden jerk causes one of the joists to fall onto the roadway. Dennis whose car is travelling behind Jo stops quickly to avoid the joist. Robert, who is behind Dennis, is speaking on his mobile phone and does not notice Dennis stopping until it is too late.

Roberta asks him to take delivery of a number of large drums of cooking oil whilst she is at the bank. The deliverer of the drums leaves them at the rear entrance of the restaurant and Pat who is alone, tries to carry them one at a time, into the store room. As he is carrying the second drum, he feels a sharp pain in his back and is unable to straighten up. On her return, Roberta takes him to hospital where it is confirmed that the injury to Pat’s spine is due to him lifting the heavy drums.\nThe prognosis is that the injury will heal in time and that Pat will be able to return to his usual duties in about 6 weeks. After Pat has been off work for some weeks in constant pain (neither medication nor physiotherapy help him), he decides to consult a chiropractor who manipulates his spine but negligently and permanently damages several of the vertebrae so that Pat is unable to work at all in the future.

He is now 80 years old, and smoking was allowed on private buses in NSW until 1993. Barry was a non-smoker but has just been diagnosed with lung cancer. There are two types of lung cancer, but Barry has developed the smoking related type. He puts it down to being exposed to passive smoke for all the time he drove buses. He wife also smoked until she died 20 years ago.\nBarry must go in for surgery to remove one of his lungs. The surgeon does hold out some hope as the cancer is contained in one lung only. There is a rare condition that patients can get if one of their lungs is removed and that is a failure of their other lung during surgery. The other possible side effect of surgery is a dry cough and a bit of trouble breathing for two weeks after the operation which clears up quickly soon after. Bob the surgeon doesn’t warn Barry of either risk. An alternative remedy for Barry is to remove part of his diseased lung instead of removing it totally but there is a 10% chance the cancer may return to the same lung. Barry undergoes surgery and is sent home. He then contacts his GP complaining of having a bad cough and trouble breathing. His GP informs Barry that this is a side effect of surgery that crops up on occasions.\nBarry’s GP prescribes him some medication to relieve his symptoms. He walks into his local chemist and heads towards to counter to ask the pharmacist about his medication. Barry trips over on some cough medicine that had fallen off the shelf an hour ago. The glass bottle full of liquid had dropped on the ground and smashed. He is rushed to hospital where he is diagnosed with a severe back injury which will require 12 months treatment and result in possibly permanent damage. He can now only walk with a cane or a walking trolley.\nBarry comes to you for advice and claims he would never have had the operation had his surgeon advised him of both risks. Advise Barry as to whether he will be successful in action against Bob the surgeon and the chemist for any of his injuries. Focus on the questions of factual causation and scope of liability under ss 5D and 5E of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) to assist you together with any relevant case law.\n\nSmoking\n\nCLA does not apply to smoking related harm\nWyon v shirt breach\n\n\nSurgery\n\nRogers v Whitaker\nS 5O and 5P for not telling about major lung issues\nSubsection (3) of s 5D deals with the question of how to determine what a plaintiff would have done if the defendant had not been negligent, where that is an issue relevant to causation.\n\nCounters hindsight bias\nElbourne v Gibbs [2006] NSWCA 127\n\n\nS 5d\n\nFactual causation\n\nNot telling barry about surgery risks\n\n\nLegal causation\n\nBarry must show that it’s appropriate for Bob’s liability to extend to the harm he suffered.

It can cause acute but generally short lived irritation to skin and eyes, and similarly short term difficulties breathing. A cleaning company was recently employed to do a major deep clean of Boston Towers, a rather drab and unkempt building where a fungus was developing on the lower floors but moving progressively upwards. On completion, the company dumped bleach down the waste disposal just after a resident had disposed of a large quantity of industrial cleaning products containing ammonia. They had been using these products to address the fungal problem in their own apartment. Ellie is part of the Owners Corporation of the block. She is tidying up the disposal room on the 2nd floor when the fumes built to a level they work up the chute and fill the disposal room. She is knocked unconscious. One of the neighbours finds her and calls an ambulance.\r\nWhile chloramine effects are generally minor, Ellie has a strong reaction eggshell. She develops blistering and experiences serious difficulty breathing. When she arrives at the hospital emergency unit, Dr Yu administers the wrong drug, causing Ellie’s breathing difficulties to escalate. As a result, her heart and breathing stopped for almost 4 minutes and she sustained irreversible brain damage.\r\nEllie can no longer work as a National Park ranger.

Each afternoon after school, Dustin waits in the queue within the school grounds to catch a school bus (a state government bus) which drives into the school driveway to pick up the children. The bus then follows a route through Hawkins to Ruby Fields where Dustin lives some 4 kms from the school. There is always a teacher on duty at the bus queue in the afternoons. One afternoon earlier this year, Dustin was misbehaving on the queue shouting at other children and generally causing some disruption. The science teacher, Scott Clarke, was on duty. He took Dustin to task about his behaviour and - as a punishment - he confiscated his bus pass and refused to allow Dustin to board the bus.\r\nDustin left the school grounds on foot and decided to walk the 4 kilometres home, though he had never done so before, always having depended on the school bus. When he was about a kilometre from the school walking down the right hand side of a narrow laneway, Dustin was hit by an unknown car which did not stop after the accident and which has not been identified, despite a police investigation.\r\nDustin received serious head, back and leg injuries and was found unconscious on the road by a passer-by apparently only minutes after the collision. Dustin says he cannot remember any of the details of the accident other than being struck from behind. An inspection of the roadway after the accident revealed a tyre skid mark some 6 metres long and a car paint scraping along a concrete wall on the right-hand side of the lane. The police report (written by Jim Hopper) states that this evidence points to the possibility that the unidentified vehicle was on the wrong side of the road at the point of impact.\r\nDustin was rushed to the Hawkins General Hospital where he was a patient for six weeks. During a physiotherapy session at the hospital, whilst having therapy for his fractured legs, he lost his balance and fractured his wrist. There is no suggestion that either the physiotherapist or the hospital was negligent.\r\nDustin has some permanent disabilities as a result of the accident and his mother Claudia wishes to take action on his behalf against the school and against the Nominal Defendant, as the driver of the car which hit Dustin has never been found.\r\nAdvise all parties as to their rights &amp; liabilities in tort.\n\nClaudia - Scott\nDuty of care\n\nDoes D owe responsibility to plaintiff? - established category - salient features\nTeacher student category\n\n\nBreach\n\nDID THE DEFENDANT KNOW OF THE RISK, SHOULD THEY HAVE?\n\ns 5B\n\n\n\n\nCausation\n\nS 5D\n\nInfer factual causation\n\nBut for teacher confiscating pass, Child would not have walked home and got hit (strong v Woolworths)\n\n\nScope of liability\n\nYes, liability should be extended\nSlightly out of bounds of purpose of category\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDamage\n\nPhysical damage\nMental damage potentially\n\n\nRemoteness\n\nRecency\n\nMaybe in question as to the time apart that kid walked\n\n\nChain of causation\nWas the harm of a kind that was reasonably foreseeable\n\nyes, damage not too remote\nNovus actus interveniens\n\nVoluntary act\n\nHaber v walker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClaudia - Nominal defendant\n\nNominal Defendant: In NSW, where an injury is caused by an unidentified vehicle, claims can be brought against the Nominal Defendant.\nPotential Claim: Given the car that hit Dustin was never identified, Claudia can bring a claim against the Nominal Defendant for Dustin’s injuries.\n\nDoc\n\nDriver - road\n\n\nBreach\n\nHit in back, driver on wrong side of road\n\n\nCausation\n\nEvidence &amp; Causation: The police report suggests that the unidentified car might have been on the wrong side of the road, which points towards negligence on the part of the unidentified driver.\n\n\nDamages: Under the Motor Accidents Injuries Act 2017 (NSW), Dustin could claim both statutory benefits (medical treatment, lost earnings, etc.) and damages if he satisfies the requirements, such as not having a “threshold injury.”\n\n\nHolloway v McFeeters (1956) 94 CLR 47\nLimitation: If Dustin’s injuries are considered “threshold injuries” (e.g., soft tissue injuries or minor psychological injuries), then his compensation might be limited.\n\nNot the case\n\n\n\n\nClaudia - Hospital\n\nLikely nothing as no negligence suggested\n\n\n\nThree\r\nJacinta works at Luna Park as a ride attendant and managers all the rides. He has worked at Luna Park for 25 years and trains all other staff on how to operate all the rides and other amusements. He is 62 and is overweight, a smoker and drinks heavily. He has not felt well over the last few days and has complained of chest pain to centre management. He wanted to go home this particular day because he wasn’t feeling well but management insisted, he stay and operate the big dipper as they were short staffed.\r\nSeveral people walked into the cars of the big dipper with Jacinta’s supervision. Passengers are secured by a padded bar that comes down and locks into place and is also something to hang onto during the ride. As customers were getting to their seats and before the padded bar had come down locking them into place, Jacinta collapsed onto his controls causing the cars to jolt forward abruptly. Several people who were still standing at this moment fell over and hit their heads. Two women were taken to hospital with head injuries. One woman will lose the site of one eye and the other permanently damaged a nerve in her spine making it difficult for her to carry out everyday tasks. Other passengers sustained minor injuries. A third woman went into shock and was diagnosed with a recognised psychiatric illness which will require long term psychiatric treatment.\r\nThe two women who sustained head injuries can no longer work and require ongoing care to assist them with home duties. Their spouses have now become depressed because of what’s happened to their wives and have withdrawn from the world and can no longer perform their work duties and have been laid off. They both had high paying jobs. They too require psychiatric treatment.\r\nIt appears Jacinta had a heart attack and required three stents to be inserted into three of his main arteries. He remained in hospital for 10 days before he was sent home. Jacinta has decided to resign from Luna Park because of what happened. He feels very guilty for causing injuries to several customers who were on that ride. He has lost all confidence and can’t manage to find another job making it more difficult for him to pay his mortgage especially as interest rates are very high now. He has defaulted on his mortgage the bank has repossessed his unit. The bank has sold his unit, but he still owes $100k to the bank as property prices have fallen dramatically.\r\nIdentify all remoteness of damage issues in the above scenario with the use of any relevant case law. Make a case for any plaintiff you identify in arguing that the harm they suffered was not too remote from the defendant’s negligence.\n\nRemoteness of Damage Issues:\n\nJacinta’s health: His pre-existing health condition, history of smoking, drinking, and symptoms he had displayed (chest pain) are significant.\n\nManagement knew he wasn’t feeling well but insisted he operate the big dipper.\nThere’s an argument that if someone with known health issues is placed in a stressful or physically demanding situation, a health crisis (like a heart attack) is foreseeable.\n\n\nImmediate injuries: Those who were still standing when Jacinta collapsed and had injuries from the abrupt jolt of the cars are direct victims of the incident.\n\nThe harm they suffered can arguably be said to be a direct and foreseeable result of Luna Park’s negligence in making Jacinta work despite being unwell.\n\n\nPsychological harm: The woman who went into shock and was diagnosed with a recognized psychiatric illness as a result of the incident.\n\nUnder the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW), there are provisions for the recovery of damages for psychological harm.\n\nGiven the traumatic nature of the incident, it’s arguable that this type of harm was foreseeable.\n\n\n\n\nConsequential harm to spouses: The mental suffering and subsequent job losses of the spouses due to the accident of their wives might be considered too remote by some.\n\nHowever, one can argue based on the principle in Chapman v Hearse (1961) 106 CLR 112, where it was held that harm could be foreseeable if a direct victim’s injuries lead to secondary harm to others.\n\n\nJacinta’s subsequent financial and psychological hardships: Jacinta’s loss of job, financial distress, and the emotional toll due to guilt might be perceived as a result of the incident.\n\nWhether Luna Park could foresee this from their initial negligence (making him work despite health concerns) is debatable.\n\n\n\n\nCase for Plaintiffs:\n\nImmediate injured victims: It’s reasonably foreseeable that making an unwell, experienced operator manage a ride could lead to operational mishaps causing physical harm to the riders.\n\nThis is a direct consequence of the park’s negligence.\n\n\nWoman with psychiatric illness: Given the sudden and traumatic nature of the event, it’s arguable that a foreseeable outcome of such an incident is a passenger suffering psychological harm.\nSpouses: While this is a tougher argument, using Chapman v Hearse, one could claim that the severe and traumatic injuries to their wives could foreseeably result in psychological and even financial harm to close family members, given the life-changing nature of the injuries.\nThe Kind of Damage: In Hughes v Lord Advocate, it was established that the exact way the damage occurs need not be foreseeable, just the general kind. Thus, even if Luna Park did not predict the exact nature of the injuries the two women suffered, they might still be liable because injuries in general are foreseeable from malfunctioning equipment.\n\n\nPlaintiffs\n\nJacinta\n\nCan’t find a job, overworked, potentially exacerbated heart attack, bank came for house\n\n\nTwo women were taken to hospital with head injuries.\n\nOne woman will lose the site of one eye and the other permanently damaged a nerve in her spine making it difficult for her to carry out everyday tasks.\n\nDirectly affected by luna park\n\n\nThe two women who sustained head injuries can no longer work and require ongoing care to assist them with home duties.\n\nDirectly affect by luna park\n\n\n\n\nOther passengers sustained minor injuries.\n\nNot likely to get much, still direct damage\n\n\nA third woman went into shock and was diagnosed with a recognised psychiatric illness which will require long term psychiatric treatment.\n\nDirect damage by luna park\n\n\nTheir spouses have now become depressed because of what’s happened to their wives and have withdrawn from the world and can no longer perform their work duties and have been laid off.\n\nIndirect damage, still counts\nThe Wagon Mound (No 2)\nKavanagh v Akhtar (1998) 45 NSWLR 58\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 8: Trevorrow\nQuestions\r\nPlease consider the questions below and draft responses for discussion in your seminar groups:\n\nLampard-Trevorrow was preceded by a number of cases brought by members of the Stolen Generations. On what grounds did the cases of Kruger (1997), Cubillo (2001), and Williams (1999) fail? Could alternative judgments make a compelling argument for a different outcome in Kruger, Cubillo, and Williams?\n\n\nin Williams (time extension application), Studdert J was not satisfied that there was sufficient evidence available to the plaintiff to establish her case because the actions of the AWB were based upon policies of beneficial intent, according to the standards and values of the 1940s.\nIn Cubillo (trial), O’Loughlin J found that the Commonwealth had pursued a policy of assimilation based on what was thought to be in the best interests of the children at that time.\nThe litigants in Kruger were unsuccessful in claiming that the Aboriginals Ordinance 1918 (Cth) was unconstitutional. None of the Justices found the Ordinance contrary to s 116 of the Australian Constitution (freedom of religion), 9 and all Justices considered that there was a sufficient nexus between the Ordinance and s 122 of the Constitution (which confers legislative power to make laws for the government of a territory)\n\n\nHow did the court in the first instance and the Supreme Court of South Australia differ on the question of false imprisonment? Detail the precise legal reasoning of the two courts. Was the SA Full Court incorrect as a matter of principle?\n\n\nIn the initial case, the court found the State of South Australia liable for false imprisonment. The original judge likely took into account the lack of parental consent and the lack of any lawful justification for taking Bruce Trevorrow into foster care\nOn appeal, the Full Court reversed the initial ruling on the issue of false imprisonment.\n\nThe Court stated that “the plaintiff’s restraint during his placement with the foster family was attributable to the family’s obligation to care for him and to his continuing immaturity, and is not a restraint of the required kind for the purposes of the tort.”\n\n\nThey concluded that Bruce Trevorrow’s movement was restricted due to his status as a child needing care, rather than as a result of an unlawful act of imprisonment.\n\n\nWhy is false imprisonment an important action in this context?\n\n\ndirectly addresses the legality and human rights implications of forcibly removing Aboriginal children from their families without consent\n\n\nCould you have argued the false imprisonment issue differently? Review the false imprisonment readings (Text at 3.4) and consider the following. Who was sued for false imprisonment, the State or the foster parents? The Full Court said at [285]: “It might be added that if this is a case of total restraint or total deprivation of freedom of movement, then all small children are, as a matter of fact, equally subject to the same restraint. Infants can go only where their parents or guardians take them or allow them to go.” Is this relevant in an action against the State. Is it relevant in an action against the foster parents? How does Kirsten Gray’s judgment assist with assessing this claim?\n\n\nYes, one could argue that any restraint resulting from an unlawful act, like removing a child without parental consent, should be considered “total restraint,” thereby constituting false imprisonment.\nThe State of South Australia was sued for false imprisonment.\nNo, it’s not directly relevant when suing the State, as the issue hinges on the legality of the State’s initial action of removal, not the general condition of childhood.\nYes, it could be relevant in an action against the foster parents as it pertains to the nature of the restraint experienced by the child while in foster care.\r\nNeither the trial Judge nor the Full Court considered the issue of directness? Should they have? Would this have assisted the plaintiff or the defendant? What false imprisonment case authorities were considered? Are there any other false imprisonment cases discussed in the text that would have supported Mr Trevorrow’s case?\nYes, the issue of directness could have been important for clarifying the causal link between the State’s actions and the alleged false imprisonment.\naddressing directness could potentially have clarified the State’s liability and possibly assisted the plaintiff.\n\n\nHow was the question of the duty of care determined? What salient features were considered?\n\n\nThe statutory role of the APB as “the legal guardian of every Aboriginal child” under section 10 of the Aborigines Act 1934 (SA)\nobject of the scheme was chiefly to protect Aboriginal children and create a close relationship between the state and Aboriginal children\nThe lack of consent from the parents for fostering the child\n\n\nDrawing on short, specific, and focused quotations from South Australia v Lampard-Trevorrow [2010] 56, detail how the court fulfilled the requirements of a) breach, b) damage, c) causation, and d) remoteness. You were provided with a copy of this judgement to ensure that everyone was working with the same text. Please provide the paragraph references for each of your quotations.\n\n\nBreach\n\nGray J concludes that the State had the responsibility to exercise due care when removing the plaintiff from his family and placing him in foster care:\n\nThat fact imposed on the State a duty to ensure that the powers were exercised with due care. Due care in the circumstances involved, at a minimum, checking the facts, assessing the child, assessing the foster family and then monitoring the placement.”\n\n\n\n\nDamage\n\nThe court examines the damages related to the plaintiff’s separation from his family and how it was foreseeable that such separation would result in harm:\n\nThat fact imposed on the State a duty to ensure that the powers were exercised with due care. Due care in the circumstances involved, at a minimum, checking the facts, assessing the child, assessing the foster family and then monitoring the placement.”\n\n\n\n\nCausation\n\nThe court discusses the causal relationship between the plaintiff’s removal and the harm he suffered:\n\n“His Honour decided ‘that there were, as a matter of probability, multiple causes of the plaintiff’s injuries and losses.’ It was significant, however, that from a commonsense point of view the plaintiff’s removal was a ‘material cause’ of his lifelong depression and its consequences.”\n\n\n\n\nRemoteness\n\nforeseeable risks and consequences related to the breach of duty, which can be seen as indirectly addressing the issue of how “remote” or “direct” the consequences were.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the relationship between ‘standards of the time’ and ‘changing community standards’? How were both relevant in the Trevorrow cases? Again, provide quotations (with paragraph references) from any of the judgments. Critically consider whose history and from whose standpoint standards of the time are considered?\n\n\nThe concept of “standards of the time” refers to the prevailing ethical, social, and legal norms during the period when an action took place. On the other hand, “changing community standards” refers to the evolution of those norms over time, which may result in a different interpretation or evaluation of past actions based on current standards.\n\nthe court considered the APB’s actions based on what was thought to be in the best interests of Aboriginal children at that time. However, given the changing community standards, those actions were later found to be damaging and wrong. The tension between “standards of the time” and “changing community standards” is especially evident when considering the APB’s “guardianship” role and whether their actions could be justified under the law and societal norms of the time.\n\n\n“standards of the time” are defined by those in power,\n\n\nButi describes Bruce Trevorrow as the ‘ideal plaintiff’. What does Buti mean, and how does this contribute to our understanding of the potentially limited impact of the case?\n\n\nTrevorrow’s personal circumstances and the facts of his case were particularly well-suited for legal action, making it easier to establish liability and harm\nWell documented, highly emotional, highly impacted, clearly wronged\n\n\nTo what extent is a system of reconciliation and reparation preferable to individual cases?\n\n\nLikely a good idea for general populace, with specific atrocities receiving special consideration\nrecognizing that these issues often impact entire communities,\nmore efficient and equitable, as it doesn’t require the substantial resources and time that individual legal cases often do\n\n\nPlease do a media search to identify different reparation models, both in Australia and internationally. Is there a model that you prefer?\n\n\nSocial Services\nExample: The Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa recommended various social services as part of its reparation policies.\nPros: Addresses long-term needs like education, health, and housing.\nCons: Requires sustained commitment, may be hard to implement.\n\n\nThe Stolen Generations is only one of the harms that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have experienced in the 250 years of Australia as a colonial-settler nation. What other harms might be addressed through Torts?\n\n\nTerra nullius and native title\n\n\nThe Civil Liability Act was amended in 2018 in response to the Royal Commission into institutional child abuse. How does the Part 1B of the Act change the common law in relation to duty of care, breach of duty and vicarious liability? Would any of these statutory reforms be applicable in relation to the Stolen Generations?\n\n\nWeek 9: Negligence - Defences\nQuestions:\n\nWhat will a defendant have to prove to establish a defence of contributory negligence at common law?\n\n\ns 5R\n\nFor that purpose—\n\n(a)  the standard of care required of the person who suffered harm is that of a reasonable person in the position of that person, and\n(b)  the matter is to be determined on the basis of what that person knew or ought to have known at the time.\n\n\n\n\ns 5S\n\nIn determining the extent of a reduction in damages by reason of contributory negligence, a court may determine a reduction of 100% if the court thinks it just and equitable to do so, with the result that the claim for damages is defeated\ns 5S requires the courts to undertake the same comparison of parties’ culpability as required under the apportionment legislation\n\n\n\n\nEvaluate the scope of contributory negligence under the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW).\n\n\nThe current New South Wales provision is comprised in Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1965 (NSW) s 9, headed ‘Apportionment of liability in cases of contributory negligence’:\n\n9(1) If a person (the ‘claimant’) suffers damage as the result partly of the claimant’s failure to take reasonable care (‘contributory negligence’) and partly of the wrong of any other person:\n\n(a) a claim in respect of the damage is not defeated by reason of the contributory negligence of the claimant, and\n(b) the damages recoverable in respect of the wrong are to be reduced to such extent as the court thinks just and equitable having regard to the claimant’s share in the responsibility for the damage.\n\n\n(2) Subsection (1) does not operate to defeat any defence arising under a contract.\n(3) If any contract or enactment providing for the limitation of liability is applicable to the claim, the amount of damages recoverable by the claimant by virtue of subsection (1) is not to exceed the maximum limit so applicable.\n\n\nSection 8 of the Act states that a ‘wrong’ means an act or omission that:\n\n(a) gives rise to a liability in tort in respect of which a defence of contributory negligence is available at common law, or\n(b) amounts to a breach of a contractual duty of care that is concurrent and coextensive with a duty of care in tort.\n\n\nA two-stage process to apportion damages.\n\nThe courts will:\n\n(a) compare the parties’ responsibility and actions from the point of departure of the standard of care of the reasonable person (not moral culpability); and\n(b) have regard to the role of each party’s failure in causing the harm suffered by the plaintiff.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the elements of the defence of voluntary assumption of risk? How has this defence been modified by the Civil Liability Act?\n\n\nThe elements of this defence were set out by the High Court in Roggenkamp v Bennett (1950) 80 CLR 292, 300\n\n(a) actually knew of the risk of injury; and\n(b) voluntarily accepted the risk of injury; and\n(c) understood the full nature and extent of the scope of the risk.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the effect of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) s 5L? How does it interact with the provisions in Division 4 of the Act?\n\n\nIn New South Wales the s 5L defence was first considered in Falvo v Australian Oztag Sports Association [2006] NSWCA 17,\nElements\n\n(1)  A person (the defendant) is not liable in negligence for harm suffered by another person (the plaintiff) as a result of the materialisation of an obvious risk of a dangerous recreational activity engaged in by the plaintiff.\n(2)  This section applies whether or not the plaintiff was aware of the risk.\n\n\nSo, when considered in conjunction with s 5L:\n\nSection 5L specifically focuses on “obvious risks” in “dangerous recreational activities.”\nSections 5M and 5N expand on the general theme of risks: inherent risks and risks that have been warned against.\n\n\nThe case of Falvo v Australian Oztag Sports Association [2006] NSWCA 17 would have looked into how the “obvious risk” in a “dangerous recreational activity” was defined and interpreted in the context of the sport of Oztag.\n\n\nBasten JA’s judgment in  Singh bhnf Ambu Kanwar v Lynch [2020] NSWCA applies rules of statutory interpretation to determine the meaning of ‘recreational activity’ in the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW).  What rules does His Honour apply? Do you think it was possible to arrive at a different interpretation - why? (Hint: the ordinary meaning of the defined term was held to qualify (or “read down”) the statutory definition in Rennie Golledge Pty Ltd v Ballard (2012) 82 NSWLR 231 (see [128]-[132]) and Greater Shepparton City Council v Clarke (2017) 56 VR 229 (see [62]-[77]). Hint #2: Part 1A Div 5 of the CLA was inserted by the Civil Liability Amendment (Personal Responsibility) Act 2002.)\n\n\nBasten JA’s Rules of Statutory Interpretation in Singh bhnf Ambu Kanwar v Lynch:\n\nUsed the Literal Rule, considering the plain or ordinary meaning of “recreational activity.”\nApplied the Contextual Rule, looking at the broader intent and context of the CLA, especially given the emphasis on personal responsibility from the amendment.\nPossibly invoked the Purpose or Mischief Rule to discern the problem the legislation intended to address.\n\n\nPotential for Different Interpretation?\n\nPrecedents like Rennie Golledge Pty Ltd v Ballard and Greater Shepparton City Council v Clarke suggest the ordinary meaning can limit or “read down” a statutory definition.\nOne might argue for a narrower understanding of “recreational activity” based on everyday language, even if the statutory definition is broader.\n\n\n\n\nRefer to the majority judgment in Tapp. How did the majority decide the question of obviousness?\n\n\nThe majority justices found that the plaintiff, Ms. Tapp, did not successfully prove that her fall resulted from a deterioration in the surface of the arena.\nMoreover, Ms. Tapp didn’t specify how the arena surface had deteriorated.\nDue to this, the plaintiff’s claim was defeated by s 5L of the CLA, which posits that injuries caused by the materialisation of an obvious risk of a dangerous recreational activity do not hold the defendant liable.\nEssentially, the majority deemed the risk of participating in the event on the given surface to be an “obvious risk” related to the dangerous recreational activity of campdrafting.\n\n\nThe NSWCA decision in Tapp was applied in Castle v Perisher Blue Pty Ltd [2020] NSWSC 1652 before it was reversed in the High Court. Do you think Castle would be decided differently in light of the High Court’s decision in Tapp?\n\n\nLikely be thrown out or ruled negatively as tapp was overturned\n\n\nWhat is a “risk warning” under Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) s 5M?\n\n\nA ‘risk warning’ is a warning given in a manner which is reasonably likely to result in people being warned of a risk before they engage in a recreational activity\n\ns 5M: no duty of care will be owed in respect of a risk of a recreational activity if the risk was the subject of a risk warning.\nA defendant may not rely on a risk warning given to an incapable person\n\n(including a child of a young age, or person with a physical or mental disability)\n\n\nexcept where the person was under the control of or accompanied by another capable person or their parent.\n\n\n\n\nThe risk warning defence under s 5M was established in Sharp v Parramatta Council. The warning was: “PERSONS USING THE PLATFORMS AND SPRINGBOARDS DO SO AT THEIR OWN RISK”. The Court’s reasons were stated at [31]: “The general risk involved in using the 10 metre platform was of injury from diving or jumping from the platform. In my view the sign warns of that risk. The risk to which the sign is directed is that involved in the activity of “using” the platforms and springboards. The use referred to is that of jumping and diving into the pool below.

Consider the application of the section in Russell v Edwards [2006] NSWCA 19.\n\n\nRussell v Edwards [2006] NSWCA 19\n\nAshley Russell, was 16 years old and was a guest at a birthday party for 15 or 20 teenage guests, held by the defendants for their son at their home.\nThe defendants knew that the under-age guests were drinking alcohol and even provided some of the drinks consumed by the plaintiff and others\n\ndefendants allowed their young guests who showed obvious signs of intoxication to use the backyard swimming pool.\nThe plaintiff dived into the shallow end of the pool, struck his head and was severely injured.\n\n\nThe trial judge found that s 50 defeated the plaintiffs claim because all the requirements of the section were met: the plaintiff was intoxicated to the extent that his capacity to exercise reasonable care and skill was impaired, his intoxication caused his inability to judge the water depth and his injury was caused by his intoxication.\n\nSelf induced means voluntary in this case, ignorance is irrelevant\n\n\nCourt of Appeal held that Ashley Russell’s intoxication was the direct cause of his injury\n\n\nSection 50 of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) deals with the impact of an injured person’s self-induced intoxication on claims for damages. Specifically:\n\nIf a plaintiff’s ability to exercise reasonable care and skill is significantly impaired due to their self-induced intoxication, and\nThis impairment was a cause of the plaintiff’s harm,\n\n\nIn conclusion, Section 50 served to shield the defendants from liability by emphasizing the plaintiff’s own responsibility for his injuries due to his self-induced intoxication, despite the defendants’ potential negligence in allowing intoxicated minors to use their pool.\n\n\nExplain how the provisions with respect to so called ‘good samaritans’, criminals, and apologists apply with reference to the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW).\n\n\nTortious liability of Good Samaritan ss 55-58\n\n(a) Is there a positive duty to rescue?\n(b) Is the rescuer able to recover in the event that they themselves are injured during a rescue?\n(c) Is the rescuer liable where he or she exacerbates the condition of the person being rescued?\na person acting in good conscience who comes to the rescue of someone and is injured as a result, will have an action in negligence against the person whose fault created the situation of danger (Chapman v Hearse (1961) 106 CLR 112).\n\nincluding for mental harm (Mount Isa Mines Ltd v Pusey (1970) 125 CLR 383 and now Pt 3 of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW)).\n\n\n\n\nThe illegality of a plaintiff’s actions may operate as a complete defence at common law\n\nMiller v Miller (2011) 242 CLR 44\n\n\nImmunity from civil liability, for death or personal injury, for food donors has been included in civil liability legislation in all Australian jurisdictions\nAt common law, admissions of regret or apologies will not generally constitute admissions of liability (Dovuro Pty Ltd v Wilkins (2003) 215 CLR 317) and will have little evidentiary value on the breach of duty issue.\r\nNegligence VI - Defences\r\nQuestion 1\r\nPlease prepare answers to the following problem before your second seminar this week.\r\nNoreen Cummins is a teacher working at Moree Public School in far western New South Wales. The School decided to take the students to the snowfields in Perisher Blue for an excursion. Noreen was asked to accompany the group as part of her duties. Some students thought it would be a good idea to take along large “For Sale” signs from the local real estate agent to be used as toboggans on the slopes. Six large signs were taken on the trip.\r\nOn their first day at Perisher Blue, they loaded their ‘For Sale’ signs and took the Ski Tube to the main office. A sign near the office read ‘Snowboarding is a dangerous activity’. Staff of the snowfields directed the School group to ski lifts and to the beginner slopes.\r\nThe School group decided to slide on the ‘For Sale’ signs on the “Beginner” slopes. After an hour on the slope, River is bored and throws a snowball at Noreen which hits her hard in the face. Noreen is stunned and hurt, and she runs over to River and shouts at them, that if she wasn’t a teacher she would ‘bury them deep in the snow!’\r\nFrustrated and a little upset, Noreen decides to slide head first in an area 100 metres away from the group. In the course of her first slide, Noreen crashed into a snow-covered rock protruding 600mm from the ground and sustained considerable spinal injuries. During the course of one of her subsequent physiotherapy sessions, she falls in a way that significantly aggravates the damage to her back.

He decides to drive his new Lexus LC500 which he purchased this week and to put it through its paces on the way to John’s.  John lives about 40 kilometres away and there are two tollways required to get there from Paul’s place. The party finishes at 1am and Paul has had 12 drinks over the space of 4 hours. He feels fine so decides to drive home. On the way home he crosses an intersection but doesn’t realise a pedestrian is crossing the road. May not have had to stop if sober He slams on his brakes, but another vehicle collides into Paul’s car from behind causing it severe damage would not have hit pedestrian if not smacked behidn.  The pedestrian gets up and starts abusing Paul who yells out at the pedestrian claiming he walked out against the traffic lights.

The duty extends to other drivers, passengers, pedestrians, and owners of property adjacent to the road. In Lynch v Lynch did the driver’s duty of care come within the established category, or was the case novel? What was the principal policy consideration on which the court relied in its conclusion?\n\nthis duty was imposed on an unborn child’s mother where the child sued her own mother for negligent driving.\nIn this case, a child was born with cerebral palsy, caused while in utero by a car accident attributable to her mother’s negligence.\n\nThe mother was held to owe a duty of care to her own unborn child and the child plaintiff was able to recover damages from her mother after her birth.\n\n\nThe fact that this case did not establish a general duty of care by a mother to her foetus was affirmed in the Queensland case of Bowditch v McEwan [2003] 2 Qd R 615\n\nwhich followed Lynch and confirmed that the principle that a child may recover damages from its mother for her negligent conduct extends only to the mother’s negligent driving rather than a more general duty encompassing all of a mother’s conduct during pregnancy.\n\n\nThe case of Lynch v Lynch was novel in that it established that a mother owes a duty of care to her unborn child in the context of negligent driving.\nThe principal policy consideration seems to be a balance between the rights and interests of the mother and the potential harm to the unborn child, especially in the context of negligent driving\n\n\nConsider the decision of the High Court in Harriton v Stephens[2006] HCA 15. What was the primary basis for the rejection of the plaintiffs’ claims?\n\nActions for ‘wrongful life’ are not available in Australian common law:\n\nmedical advisors owe no duty of care to a child born disabled because the doctor failed to advise the child’s mother during her pregnancy of circumstances which would have led the child’s mother to obtain a lawful termination of that pregnancy or to have avoided the pregnancy.\n\n\nIn Harriton v Stephens, the child plaintiff was born with very severe disabilities as a result of her mother having contracted rubella in the early stages of pregnancy.\nThe overriding reason for the refusal to impose a duty of care in a ‘wrongful life’ case was the impossibility of defining and assessing the damage claimed\nHeld\n\nIn Harriton v Stephens, the High Court on appeal held\n\nThat part of the reason the Plaintiff could not succeed was a comparison, for damages purposes, between being born with disabilities and not being born at all was impossible\nA duty of care cannot be stated where the Plaintiff can never prove the actual damage claimed\nThat a doctor does not owe a duty to a fetus to prevent their birth\nPublic policy reasons may be relevant to a determination of the duty issue\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider the dissenting judgment by Kirby J. Do you think he effectively counters the majority’s arguments or not?\n\nNature of Damages: Kirby J took a different perspective on the nature of the damages. While the majority emphasized the difficulty of comparing a life with severe disabilities to non-existence, Kirby J focused on the tangible, quantifiable aspects of the plaintiff’s life, such as the costs of medical care, treatment, and other necessities arising from the disabilities.\nDuty of Care: Kirby J argued that doctors owe a duty of care to both the mother and the fetus. In his view, if the mother had been properly advised, she might have made a different decision, which would have had a direct impact on the child’s life and well-being.\nPublic Policy: While the majority saw public policy as a reason against recognizing the claim, Kirby J highlighted that public policy could also support such a claim. He emphasized the importance of holding medical professionals accountable for their advice and actions.\nComparison with Other Jurisdictions: Kirby J also referred to decisions from other jurisdictions where ‘wrongful life’ claims had been recognized, suggesting that Australian law could evolve in a similar direction.\nMoral and Ethical Concerns: Kirby J’s dissent is also grounded in deeper philosophical, moral, and ethical considerations. He questioned whether it is appropriate for the law to assert that life, even with disabilities, is always better than non-existence.\n\n\nReferring to Dhupar v Lee, what damages are excluded by s 71 of the Civil Liability Act, and what damages are not excluded?\n\nDamages Excluded by Section 71 of the Civil Liability Act 2002:\n\nEconomic loss associated with the cost of rearing or maintaining the child.\nLoss of earnings incurred by a plaintiff while rearing or maintaining the child.\n\n\nDamages NOT Excluded by Section 71 of the Civil Liability Act 2002:\n\nAdditional costs of rearing or maintaining a child because of a disability suffered by the child.\nEconomic loss arising from an injury suffered by the mother as a result of the birth.\nEconomic loss for psychiatric injury (or any other physical injury to the parent) caused by the birth of the child.\n\n\n\n\nReferring to John XXIII College v SMA, how did the Court decide the question of normal fortitude?\n\nEvent hosted by ANU, knew that people would go from different pubs, girl got sexually assaulted, was college liable for assault and psychiatric issues\nNormal fortitude: the normal mental strength of an average person\n\n\nIn John XXIII College v SMA, there were two allegations of breach of duty; how were these decided and how did the issue of causation differ for each?\n\nBreach of Duty Allegation 1: The College directed its students to leave the ANU campus on the night of 6 August 2015 after they had commenced drinking.\n\nDecision: The Court of Appeal found that it had not been established that the College’s direction for the students to leave the premises caused the resident (SMA) to suffer injury.\n\n\nBreach of Duty Allegation 2: The College was negligent in their handling of SMA’s complaint following the assault.\n\nDecision: Both the primary judge and the Court of Appeal concurred that the College had a duty to investigate complaints competently and in accordance with its policies.\n\nIt was determined that the College failed to do so, which materially contributed to SMA developing a psychiatric injury.\n\n\n\n\nCausation: For the first allegation, the causation link between the College’s direction and SMA’s injury was not established. However, for the second allegation, there was a clear causal link between the College’s mishandling of the complaint and SMA’s psychiatric injuries.\n\n\nBriefly explain the general scheme of Part 3 of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) dealing with mental harm? In Sheehan v SRA; Wicks v SRA, why was the High Court critical of the lower courts’ approach in considering s 30 without having considered s 32? How might s 32 have affected the outcome of the case?\n\nPart 3 of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) addresses the liability of individuals for negligently causing mental harm or nervous shock to another. The provisions aim to strike a balance between the rights of plaintiffs to recover damages for mental harm and the potential for widespread and indeterminate liability for defendants.\nKey Provisions:\n\ns 28: negligence is required to claim damages\nSection 30: Establishes that a person does not owe a duty of care to another to prevent mental harm unless the person ought to have foreseen that a person of “normal fortitude” might suffer a recognized psychiatric illness if reasonable care were not taken.\nSection 31: Concerns the liability for mental harm arising from sudden shock. It states that a person is not liable for harm suffered as a result of the sudden witnessing of a person being killed, injured, or put in peril.\nSection 32: Outlines that for a person to recover damages for pure mental harm, the harm must have been suffered from a sudden and unexpected traumatic event or the victim must have witnessed, at the scene, a person being killed, injured, or put in peril.\n\n\nSheehan v SRA; Wicks v SRA:\n\nBackground:\n\nThe case revolved around two police officers, Mr. Wicks and Mr. Sheehan, who were among the first respondents to a rail crash. They claimed to have suffered psychiatric injuries as a result of witnessing the aftermath of the crash.\n\n\nHigh Court’s Criticism:\n\nThe High Court criticized the lower courts for considering s 30 (foreseeability of harm) without first addressing s 32 (requirements for witnessing an event).\nThe lower courts’ approach was seen as problematic because determining foreseeability of harm (s 30) without considering the specific requirements of witnessing an event (s 32) could lead to a misinterpretation of the legislation and potentially unjust outcomes.\n\n\nImpact of Section 32:\n\nIf section 32 had been appropriately considered by the lower courts, it might have led to a quicker acknowledgment that the officers had indeed witnessed victims “being put in peril” since the survivors of the derailment remained in peril until they were rescued.\nThis would have satisfied the requirements of s 32, and thus, the focus would shift to the foreseeability of the harm under s 30, potentially leading to a clearer path to the officers’ successful claims.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does the Civil Liability Act 2002(NSW) operate with respect to “mental harm” as opposed to “pure mental harm” cases?\n\nmental harm means impairment of a person’s mental condition.\npure mental harm means mental harm other than consequential mental harm.\nIt differentiates between harm that is solely mental in nature (pure mental harm) and harm that is a consequence of a physical injury or other circumstances.\nThe Act also emphasizes the need for foreseeability and the requirement for recognized psychiatric illnesses in claims for pure mental harm.\n\n\nCompare the two cases of Annetts v Australian Stations Pty Ltd and Morgan v Tame. (a) Critically analyse the court’s approach in these two cases and explain the varied conclusions. (b) In cases of psychiatric harm, what does ‘a person of normal fortitude’ mean? To what extent if any does the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) impact on the definition of the scope of ‘a person of normal fortitude’?\n\nTame v State of New South Wales:\n\nFacts: Mrs Tame was mistakenly linked to a high blood alcohol level due to a clerical error following a car accident. This caused her significant distress, given her longstanding abhorrence of drinking and driving.\nHeld: The High Court stressed that while reasonable foreseeability is required for establishing a duty of care, the concept of ‘normal fortitude’ isn’t a prerequisite in all cases. In Mrs Tame’s case, the injury was not foreseeable as a person of normal fortitude would not have suffered psychiatric injury from such a clerical error. The court thus dismissed her appeal.\n\n\nAnnetts v Australian Stations Pty Ltd:\n\nFacts: The Annetts’ son, James, went missing while working for the defendant. The parents were informed about their son’s disappearance and subsequently his death, causing them significant distress.\nHeld: The High Court found in favor of the Annetts. Given the relationship between the defendant and the plaintiffs (the defendant had assured them of their son’s safety), it was reasonably foreseeable that the parents would suffer psychiatric injury upon learning of their son’s disappearance and death.\n\n\nDifferences in the Courts’ Approach:\n\nIn Tame, the court took a restrictive approach based on foreseeability and the concept of ‘normal fortitude’. It emphasized that not every emotional distress qualifies for compensation.\nIn Annetts, the court took a broader perspective, emphasizing the relationship between the parties and the reasonable expectations set by the defendant’s assurances about their son’s safety.\n\n\n(b) ‘A person of normal fortitude’ and its impact under the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW):\n\nMeaning: The term ‘a person of normal fortitude’ generally refers to an average person’s ability to withstand psychological distress. It serves as a standard against which a plaintiff’s reactions to a given event are gauged. If an average person would not have foreseen psychiatric injury under similar circumstances, then a defendant might not owe a duty of care.\nImpact of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW): While the Act does emphasize foreseeability, it does not rigidly hold ‘normal fortitude’ as a prerequisite for all cases. However, it remains a significant factor in determining whether psychiatric injury was foreseeable.\nIn the Context of the Discussed Cases: In Tame, the court concluded that a person of normal fortitude would not have suffered a psychiatric injury from the clerical error. Whereas, in Annetts, given the assurances of the defendant about their son’s safety, it was reasonably foreseeable that the plaintiffs, as ordinary parents, would suffer psychiatric harm from the tragic news.\n\n\n\n\nIn Kozarov v State of Victoria (2022) 273 CLR 115 Kiefel CJ and Keane J said at [2]: “It is apparent that the issues with which this Court is concerned would not have arisen but for what seems to have been a misunderstanding of the effect of this Court’s decision in Koehler v Cerebos (Australia) Ltd.” In what way was Koehler misunderstood?\n\nIn Kozarov v State of Victoria, Kiefel CJ and Keane J highlighted that the lower courts misinterpreted Koehler by overemphasizing the need for an employer to have specific knowledge of an employee’s vulnerability to psychiatric harm, rather than focusing on the broader foreseeability of such harm arising from the employer’s actions.\n\n\nWhat arguments do Vines, San Roque, and Rumble make with regard to explaining why tort law treats physical and mental harm differently?\n\nVines, San Roque, and Rumble, in their article ‘Is “nervous shock” still a feminist issue?\nThe duty of care and psychiatric injury in Australia’, argue that the differential treatment of physical and mental harm in tort law has historical and gendered roots.\nThey contend that the law’s hesitancy to recognize claims for psychiatric injury is influenced by outdated views on mental harm being associated with emotional responses, which are stereotypically linked to women.\nFurthermore, they suggest that the traditional view deems emotional or psychological responses as less genuine or less deserving of legal protection than physical injuries.\nBy exploring the evolution of the law and its cultural context, they highlight the need for the law to move beyond these outdated notions and treat psychiatric injury with the same rigor and respect as physical harm.\n\n\nWhile Kozarov is situated in a work context, with Vines et al arguing that gendered understandings of mental harm are more accentuated in the private sphere, does this decision offer an incremental step towards reducing the marginalisation of mental harm as an injury?\n\nYes, the decision in Kozarov, even though it is situated in a work context, can be seen as an incremental step towards reducing the marginalization of mental harm as an injury.\nBy addressing and clarifying the treatment of psychiatric injury within the legal framework, the decision challenges traditional distinctions and hierarchies between physical and mental harm.\nWhile Vines et al highlight the accentuated gendered understandings of mental harm in the private sphere, decisions like Kozarov in the public or work sphere contribute to a broader shift in recognizing the legitimacy and seriousness of mental harm across various contexts.\nThis recognition can help pave the way for a more equitable treatment of mental injuries, reducing biases and outdated stereotypes associated with them.\n\n\nDo you think attitudes towards gender and mental harm have shifted since the Vines et al  article was published in 2010?\n\nSince the Vines et al article was published in 2010, the recognition and understanding of mental health and its interplay with gender have evolved considerably in the USA, Europe, and Australia.\nIn the USA, movements likeMeToo have amplified conversations about mental trauma, especially among women, while in Europe, countries like the UK have initiated national mental health campaigns and strategies emphasizing inclusivity.\nMeanwhile, in Australia, campaigns such as “R U OK?” have furthered public discourse on mental health, reflecting a growing acknowledgment of its importance in both the private and public spheres.\r\nNegligence VII - Categories of Duty of Care\r\nPlease prepare an outline answer to the following problem before your class this week.\r\nQuestion One\r\nThe Diamonds have two teenage daughters. Last July they decided that given their financial resources they could not afford to have any more children and that their family is “complete”. After some deliberations, the Diamonds decided that Elizabeth Diamond would undergo sterilisation.\r\nIn August, Elizabeth was referred to Dr Gentle (gynaecologist) who performed a tubal ligation on her. Before the operation the Diamonds were invited to a pre-operation consultation in which Dr Gentle explained the procedure. She indicated that even though it was invasive, it was relatively safe and a secure form of birth control and fairly common. At the pre-operation consultation, Elizabeth, who is 42, also indicated that quite apart from the financial considerations she was anxious not to have another child because she has heard that once a women passes the age of 35 there is an increased possibility of birth complications and a high probability that her child could have Down Syndrome. Elizabeth is also aware that the sperm of older men can similarly cause birth defects although such information is rarely discussed in the media or indeed clinical settings. Bruce Diamond is 51. Dr Gentle explained that while it is indeed true that a woman’s age is a crucial factor in childbirth management, Mrs Diamond did not need to worry because tubal ligation is an effective system of preventing childbirth. She looks puzzled at the mention of aging sperm.\r\nIn November, Mrs Diamond discovered that she is pregnant in spite of the tubal ligation. Dr Gentle has since explained to the Diamonds that even though re canalisation (the re-joining of the tube) can occur in tubal ligation, this is rather very rare and so she did not mention this possibility to the Diamonds at the pre-operation consultation.\r\nThe Diamonds do not feel abortion care or adoption are options.\r\nAfter the 12-week ultrasound, the Diamonds discovered that their new child will have Down Syndrome. They are offered a termination of pregnancy which they refuse.\r\na) Advise the Diamonds.\n\n\nPlaintiff’s (Diamonds’) Arguments:\n\nLoss of Opportunity to Terminate:\n\nSimilar to Veivers v Connolly and CES v Superclinics, the Diamonds may argue they lost the opportunity to make an informed decision about terminating the pregnancy due to Dr. Gentle’s failure to inform them of the rare but potential risk of re-canalization.\n\n\nClaim for Damages:\n\nSection 71 supports the Diamonds in claiming damages for the costs associated with rearing a child with Down Syndrome.\n\n\n\n\nDefendant’s (Dr. Gentle’s) Arguments:\n\nStandard of Care Met:\n\nDr. Gentle could invoke section 5O, stating that her conduct was in line with what was “widely accepted in Australia by peer professional opinion as competent professional practice” at the time of the operation.\n\n\nHarriton v Stephens:\n\nMay be cited to argue that Dr. Gentle owes no duty of care toward the child born with Down Syndrome, although this wouldn’t necessarily negate the duty of care owed to Elizabeth Diamond.\n\n\n5P is for failure to warn in cases or injury or death, not in the rare occurence that the surgery does not take\r\nb) Assume the new child survives. Can the child sue Dr Gentle too? Why or why not?\n\n\nNo, wrongful life claim\n\nThe child plaintiffs in these cases are invariably disabled and claim damages to enable them to have the significant and costly extra care required by a disabled person.\n\nThe loss suffered by the children is their ‘life with disability’ as opposed to non-existence\n\n\n\n\nHarriton v Stephens:\n\nMay be cited to argue that Dr. Gentle owes no duty of care toward the child born with Down Syndrome, although this wouldn’t necessarily negate the duty of care owed to Elizabeth Diamond.\r\nQuestion Two (revisit from Module 7)\r\nJacinta works at Luna Park as a ride attendant and managers all the rides. He has worked at Luna Park for 25 years and trains all other staff on how to operate all the rides and other amusements. He is 62 and is overweight, a smoker and drinks heavily. He has not felt well over the last few days and has complained of chest pain to centre management. He wanted to go home this particular day because he wasn’t feeling well but management insisted, he stay and operate the big dipper as they were short staffed.\r\nSeveral people walked into the cars of the big dipper with Jacinta’s supervision. Passengers are secured by a padded bar that comes down and locks into place and is also something to hang onto during the ride. As customers were getting to their seats and before the padded bar had come down locking them into place, Jacinta collapsed onto his controls causing the cars to jolt forward abruptly. Several people who were still standing at this moment fell over and hit their heads. Two women were taken to hospital with head injuries. One woman will lose the site of one eye and the other permanently damaged a nerve in her spine making it difficult for her to carry out everyday tasks. Other passengers sustained minor injuries. A third woman went into shock and was diagnosed with a recognised psychiatric illness which will require long term psychiatric treatment.\r\nThe two women who sustained head injuries can no longer work and require ongoing care to assist them with home duties. Their spouses have now become depressed because of what’s happened to their wives and have withdrawn from the world and can no longer perform their work duties and have been laid off. They both had high paying jobs. They too require psychiatric treatment.\r\nIt appears Jacinta had a heart attack and required three stents to be inserted into three of his main arteries. He remained in hospital for 10 days before he was sent home. Jacinta has decided to resign from Luna Park because of what happened. He feels very guilty for causing injuries to several customers who were on that ride. He has lost all confidence and can’t manage to find another job making it more difficult for him to pay his mortgage especially as interest rates are very high now.  He has defaulted on his mortgage the bank has repossessed his unit. The bank has sold his unit, but he still owes $100k to the bank as property prices have fallen dramatically.\r\nIdentify all remoteness of damage issues in the above scenario with the use of any relevant case law. Make a case for any plaintiff you identify in arguing that the harm they suffered was not too remote from the defendant’s negligence.\n\n\nJacinta\n\nRemoteness of Damage Issues:\n\nJacinta’s health: His pre-existing health condition, history of smoking, drinking, and symptoms he had displayed (chest pain) are significant.\n\nManagement knew he wasn’t feeling well but insisted he operate the big dipper.\nThere’s an argument that if someone with known health issues is placed in a stressful or physically demanding situation, a health crisis (like a heart attack) is foreseeable.\n\n\nJacinta’s subsequent financial and psychological hardships:\n\n33   Liability for economic loss for consequential mental harm\n\nNot recognized psychiatric injury\n\n\nWhether Luna Park could foresee this from their initial negligence (making him work despite health concerns) is debatable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo women head injuries\n\nThe Kind of Damage: In Hughes v Lord Advocate, it was established that the exact way the damage occurs need not be foreseeable, just the general kind. Thus, even if Luna Park did not predict the exact nature of the injuries the two women suffered, they might still be liable because injuries in general are foreseeable from malfunctioning equipment.\n\n\nOther passengers\n\nRemoteness of Damage Issues\n\nThose who were still standing when Jacinta collapsed and had injuries from the abrupt jolt of the cars are direct victims of the incident.\n\nThe harm they suffered can arguably be said to be a direct and foreseeable result of Luna Park’s negligence in making Jacinta work despite being unwell.\n\n\n\n\nImmediate injured victims: It’s reasonably foreseeable that making an unwell, experienced operator manage a ride could lead to operational mishaps causing physical harm to the riders.\n\nThis is a direct consequence of the park’s negligence.\n\n\nNo psychiatric issues mentioned\n\n\nShocked woman\n\nExample formation:\n\nDoC\n\n30(2)(a) -  plaintiff witnessed, at the scene, the victim being killed, injured or put in peril…\ns 31 Pure mental harm—liability only for recognised psychiatric illness\n\n\nGo through breach, casuation\n\n\nWoman with psychiatric illness: Given the sudden and traumatic nature of the event, it’s arguable that a foreseeable outcome of such an incident is a passenger suffering psychological harm.\nSee spouses\n\nInclude s 29\n\nIn any action for personal injury, the plaintiff is not prevented from recovering damages merely because the personal injury arose wholly or in part from mental or nervous shock.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nspouses\n\nRemoteness of Damage Issues:\n\nConsequential harm to spouses: The mental suffering and subsequent job losses of the spouses due to the accident of their wives might be considered too remote by some.\nS 30 - foreseeability of the harm defines the duty of care\n\n(2)(b)  the plaintiff is a close member of the family of the victim.\nThe “normal fortitude” clause could be used to establish whether or not the mental harm to the spouses was a foreseeable consequence based on societal norms.\n\n\nS 31 - require psychiatric assistance as they have a recognised psychiatric illness\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 11: Pure Economic Loss &amp; Negligent Misstatement\nQuestions\n\nExplain the concepts of consequential economic loss and pure economic loss. With regard to pure economic loss, what distinguishes this category of the duty of care (i.e. the duty not to cause pure economic loss) from other duty categories?\n\nConsequential Economic Loss: This refers to financial losses that are a direct consequence of some physical damage to person or property. For example, if a person’s car is damaged due to someone else’s negligence, the cost of hiring a replacement car would be a consequential economic loss.\nPure Economic Loss: This is an economic loss that arises without any accompanying physical injury to a person or property. For example, if someone provides you with bad financial advice leading to an investment loss, the loss incurred is a pure economic loss.\nDistinction in Duty of Care\n\nThe concern to ensure that tort law does not stifle legitimate commercial activity\nPerre v Apand Pty  Ltd   (1999)  198  CLR  18\n\nIn  that  case,  however,  the  court  determined  that the  imposition  of  a  duty would not  offend  this  policy  consideration  because the defendant’s conduct  was  unlawful  and against even  its  own  commercial  interests and therefore the imposition of a duty would not stifle competitive commercial activity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook back to Module 3 and Problem Question 2 involving Michael and Barney (3.6). This module is concerned with Intentional Torts and the problem specifically addresses trespass to land. For heuristic purposes, how would you characterise the different damage and losses caused by the emergency fuel dump as described in the second paragraph?\n\nDirect Physical Damage: The immediate harm to the crops and seedlings that were ready for the market.\nEnvironmental Impact: The contamination of the soil, which could require the removal and replacement of topsoil and would affect the farm’s organic status.\nBusiness Interruption: The loss of income due to the inability to sell crops or maintain regular business operations, especially the supply to Sydney’s top restaurants and Carriageworks Market.\nReaccreditation Process: Loss of the farm’s organic status and the time, effort, and financial resources required for reaccreditation, which is expected to take at least 2 years.\nLong-Term Reputational Damage: Potential loss of longstanding relationships with high-end clients and the public, affecting future business prospects.\nwhether the airline could reasonably foresee the risk of economic loss to farms beneath a flight path in the event of an emergency fuel dump. If so, they might have a duty of care to prevent such a loss, making the case more similar to Perre v Apand.\n\n\nIn an action for negligent misstatement, what are the ‘salient features’ of the duty of care?\n\nIn an action for negligent misstatement, the salient features of the duty of care often include the existence of a special relationship between the parties that creates a reliance on the statement, and the foreseeability that the plaintiff would rely on the statement to their detriment.\nThe quality and purpose of the information provided also play a role in establishing this duty.\nHedley Byrne &amp; Co Ltd v Heller &amp; Partners Ltd [1964] AC 465.\n\nThis case established that a duty of care could exist in situations where one party relies on the professional expertise or advice of another, provided that the reliance is reasonable and foreseeable.\n\n\n\n\nBriefly explain the decisions in Hedley Byrne, Mutual Life, Shaddock, San Sebastian, Tepko and Roo Roofing.\n\nHedley Byrne &amp; Co Ltd v Heller &amp; Partners Ltd [1964] AC 465.\n\nThis case established that a duty of care could exist in situations where one party relies on the professional expertise or advice of another, provided that the reliance is reasonable and foreseeable.\n\n\nL Shaddock &amp; Associates Pty Ltd v Parramatta City Council   (1981) 150 CLR 225\n\nwhere property developers had purchased property within the Parramatta area and their solicitor made first a telephone inquiry, and then a written inquiry asking the council whether  the property was affected by any road-widening proposals.\nBackground\n\nIt was the usual practice of the council to make such disclosures on the certificates it issued in response to requests by intending purchasers.\nThe property was, in fact,  the  subject  of  road-widening  plans  by the  council  and the  plaintiffs  claimed they suffered financial loss as a result of the council’s negligent failure to disclose the information.\n\n\nSo, in Australia, it is not a prerequisite to the duty  of care that  the defendant  be ‘in the business’ of giving information or advice.\n\n\nMLC Assurance Co Ltd v Evatt   (1969) 122 CLR 556\n\nBackground\n\nIn that case,  the plaintiff was a policy holder with the defendant insurance company.\nHe sought investment information and advice from the insurance company regarding investment in a company, HG Palmer Ltd.\nHG Palmer Ltd soon went into liquidation and the plaintiff lost his investment.\nThe plaintiff claimed that MLC owed him a duty of care, which had been breached.\n\nThe defendant argued that the plaintiff’s pleading was bad because it did not disclose all the elements of a duty as set forth in the   Hedley Byrne   case\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Issue\n\nWas it reasonable for the plaintiff to rely on the advice from MLC when it  was not  an investment  adviser and  did  not  have any  ‘special skill’  in this field.\n\n\nHeld\n\nThe High Court held that MLC did owe the plaintiff a duty of care.\n\nTo  establish  the  duty the  plaintiff  must  establish  that,  in  the  circumstances,  it was reasonable for the plaintiff to have relied on the information provided  by the defendant.\n\n\nThe High Court held that having a ‘special skill’  was not a prerequisite to the imposition of a duty of care.\n\nThe speaker must realise or the circumstances  be such that he ought to have realised that the recipient intends to act on the information or advice\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTepko  Pty  Ltd  v  Water  Board   (2001)  206 CLR\n\nBackground\n\nplaintiff  companies,  which  were  owned  and  controlled  by  Mr  Neal  (in  a  case  in which  the  facts  were  very  convoluted),  were  the  owners  of  semi-rural  land  on  the fringe of Sydney.\nThey were seeking to have the land rezoned and then subdivided for  sale  as  suburban  housing  lots.\nOne of the conditions of the subdivision was that the plaintiffs would finance the connection of the land to water and sewerage.\nThe  plaintiffs  sought  an estimate of the cost  of such  connection  from the Water Board.\n\n\nbank decided that the development was untenable and required repayment  of its loan.\nThe land was sold for a much smaller sum than it would have been worth had it been  subdivided.\n\nIt was  later discovered that the Water Board’s estimate had been greatly overstated.\n\n\nIssue\n\nThe  plaintiffs  claimed that the  Water Board owed them a duty to take care  in the preparation of the estimate so as not to cause them financial loss.\n\n\nHeld\n\nThe High Court,  by a majority of  4 to  3,  held  that the  defendant did not  owe  a duty of  care to the plaintiff because it was unreasonable for the plaintiffs to have relied on the estimate, in all the circumstances.\n\n\nRatio\n\nThe court noted that the figure given was at best, a ‘ballpark’ figure, that it had been provided reluctantly by the Water Board only after much lobbying by the plaintiffs; that the plaintiffs had access to other expert advice;\nand that the Water Board was unaware that the figure was required for the plaintiff’s bank.\n\n\n\n\nRoo Roofing Pty Ltd v Commonwealth [2019] VSC 33,\n\na class action brought by business owners and installers of home insulation\nThe plaintiffs claimed economic losses arising out of the Home Insulation Program (HIP) that was part of the fiscal stimulus program implemented  by  the Australian Government  in 2009, in response to the Global Financial Crisis.\n\nWhen  the  government  ended  the  program  early  and  without  notice  in 2010, the plaintiffs who  had  ‘geared  up’  their businesses to  take  advantage  of the (heavily government subsidised) demand for home insulation,  claimed that the  Commonwealth was  responsible  for  their  subsequent  economic  losses.\n\n\nthe Commonwealth did not induce  the plaintiffs to take part in the HIP – it encouraged participation but the plaintiffs made their own business decisions\n\n\n\n\nOn what issue was Mutual Life reversed by majority on appeal to the Privy Council. Now that appeals from the High Court to the Privy Council have been abolished, what is the current Australian position on this issue?\n\nThe High Court held that MLC did owe the plaintiff a duty of care.\n\nTo  establish  the  duty the  plaintiff  must  establish  that,  in  the  circumstances,  it was reasonable for the plaintiff to have relied on the information provided  by the defendant.\n\n\nThe High Court held that having a ‘special skill’  was not a prerequisite to the imposition of a duty of care.\n\nThe speaker must realise or the circumstances  be such that he ought to have realised that the recipient intends to act on the information or advice\n\n\n\n\nIn Tepko, the question of reasonableness was decided by a bare 4:3 majority. Do you agree with the majority, or with the dissent?\n\nDissent, if the group was lobbying that hard, the water board ought to have suspected, or asked what affect the report would have. Low cost to resolve/low burden, low probability of harm, medium harm, medium social utility\n\n\n”In an action for acts causing pure economic loss what are the ‘salient features’ of the duty of care? Refer to Perre v Apand Pty Ltd(1999) 198 CLR 180. What did Perre decide?\n\n‘Salient features’ for a duty of care in cases of pure economic loss include the foreseeability of harm, vulnerability of the plaintiff, and the nature of the relationship between parties.\nPerre v Apand established that a duty of care could exist for pure economic loss, and set out the criteria for determining such a duty.\n\n\nCaltex Oil v “Willemstad” introduced the terms “salient features” and “ascertainable class” into Australian jurisprudence. With reference to these terms, what did the case decide?\n\nThe case introduced the concept of “salient features” to help determine when a duty of care arises, particularly in cases involving economic loss.\nIt also established the idea of an “ascertainable class,” meaning that a defendant owes a duty of care only to those who are foreseeably at risk and can be identified as belonging to a specific group that could suffer loss.\n\n\nWhat is meant by ‘vulnerability of the plaintiff’? Refer to Woolcock Street Investments Pty Ltd v CDG Pty Ltd, in particular the judgment of Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ at [23]-[24] and [31]; McHugh J at [80]; Kirby J at [168]-[169].\n\nIn Woolcock Street Investments Pty Ltd v CDG Pty Ltd  (2004) 216 CLR 515, McHugh  J held that vulnerability means ‘that by  reason  of  ignorance  or  social,  political  or  economic  constraints,  the  plaintiff was not able to protect him or herself  from the risk  of injury’  ([80]).\n\n\nBryan and Woolcock were actions by subsequent purchasers of premises. What was the “pure economic loss” alleged? What did the cases decide, and what distinguished them?\n\nBryan v Maloney: The loss was the drop in house value due to bad foundations. Court said the builder owed a duty of care to future buyers like Bryan.\nWoolcock Street Investments: The loss was a drop in commercial property value due to bad foundations. Court said no duty of care was owed to Woolcock because they weren’t vulnerable; they could have protected themselves.\nWhat Distinguished Them:\n\nThe key difference in outcomes was “vulnerability.”\n\nIn Bryan v Maloney, the court found that the plaintiff was vulnerable and couldn’t have protected themselves, thus a duty of care was owed by the builder.\nIn Woolcock Street, the court found that the plaintiff was not vulnerable because they had other means to protect themselves, such as through due diligence or contractual provisions, so no duty of care was owed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawkins v Clayton, Hill v Van Erp and were actions against solicitors in relation to deceased estates. What did these cases decide?\n\nHawkins v Clayton: The court decided that the solicitor owed a duty of care to the intended beneficiaries of a will for failing to locate and inform them, leading to avoidable delays and financial loss.\nHill v Van Erp: The court found that the solicitor owed a duty of care to the beneficiary for negligently preparing a will, which led to the will being declared invalid.\n\n\nOn what basis was Perre distinguished by the majority in Marsh v Baxter? What were the similarities between the two cases and what would you have decided?\n\nBasis for Distinction: In Marsh v Baxter, the majority distinguished the case from Perre v Apand by focusing on the lack of a “special or closer relationship” between the parties.\n\nWhile in Perre, the negligence affected an “ascertainable class” of plaintiffs, in Marsh v Baxter, the relationship was considered more remote.\n\n\nSimilarities: Both cases dealt with the issue of pure economic loss and the circumstances under which a duty of care arises.\n\nBoth also involved agricultural contexts: Perre dealt with the spread of a potato disease, while Marsh v Baxter dealt with the spread of genetically modified canola onto an organic farm.\n\n\n\n\nJohnston Tiles v Esso was an action by three classes of plaintiff. With reference to salient features, what decided in relation to each class?\n\nNone of the classes were vulnerable enough, could have taken precautions.\nBusinesses using gas for operations:\n\nLost sales due to the inability to operate fully.\nIncreased costs for substituting gas with electricity.\nNo duty of care\n\n\nDomestic users of gas:\n\nIncurred costs for purchasing electrical appliances as a replacement for gas appliances.\nunwilling to extend a duty of care for pure economic losses suffered due to disruptions in business relations with the factory.\n\n\nWorkers of businesses relying on gas:\n\nLoss of wages because the business couldn’t operate and they were temporarily stood down.\ngenerally held that they could not claim for pure economic loss as they had no direct relationship with Esso and their losses were more of a consequential nature from the harm caused to their employer.\nNot ascertainable enough\n\n\n\n\nRefer back to Module 3. In Sullivan v Moody (2001) the court rejected proximity as a determinant of a duty of care: “‘no one has ever succeeded in capturing in any precise formula’ a comprehensive test for determining whether there exists, between two parties, a relationship sufficiently proximate to give rise to a duty of care of the kind necessary for actionable negligence. The formula is not ‘proximity’.” A hallmark of the proximity cases (and also “incrementalism” focusing on analogous cases) in novel cases was the detailed considered of precedent in weighing the competing interests of plaintiff and defendant. For example, in Caltex Oil v “Willemstad” the Court reviewed numerous English cases in which pure economic loss had been denied, the reasons for departing from these given by the House of Lords in Hedley Byrne, and Canadian authorities which had allowed recovery. In Hawkins v Clayton, the Court reviewed cases dealing with the nature of the property constituted by a will, the nature of a solicitor’s safe custody facility and cases dealing with the duty of trustees to inform a beneficiary of his/her rights under the trust on attaining the age of 18. Instead of proximity, a duty of care is now determined in novel cases by reference to salient features. Do the salient features effectively consider “the relationship between the parties”? Could any of the salient features be appropriately dealt with in considering the calculus of negligence factors in s 5B(2) and, if so, which? Could any be appropriately dealt with in considering contributory negligence?\n\nYes, “salient features” effectively consider the relationship between the parties by focusing on specific factors that make it reasonable to impose a duty of care.\nForeseeability of harm and the likely seriousness of the harm could be dealt with under the calculus of negligence factors in s 5B(2).\nPlaintiff’s awareness of risk could be considered under the framework of contributory negligence. Similar to the shirt of calculus\nreasonably foreseeable plaintiff (broad)\nSalient features:\n\nVulnerability of P\nKnowledge &amp; control of D over risk\nEX: novel duty is if dr doesn’t save someone looking for help and dies right in front of him\n\n\nPolicy considerations\n\n\n\nWeek 11: Pure Economic Loss &amp; Negligent Misstatement\nPlease prepare answers to the following problems before your class this week, and be prepared to discuss them in class.\r\nProblem Questions\r\nA. Bert and Ernie own and operate a seafood restaurant called Hasta Manyana in Manyana Bay. The restaurant, which is located on the southern end of Manyana Bay, is only accessible by a pontoon. The pontoon which is called the Pride of Manyana is owned and operated by the State Transport Authority of New South Wales. Last September, Jim Henson negligently drove his ‘four wheel’ drive vehicle on to the Pride of Manyana against the express instructions of the STA personnel operating the pontoon. The central pulley system that is used to pull and manoeuvre the pontoon into place was damaged considerably. The STA ceased operating the Pride of Manyana until March this year after it had carried out repairs to the damage.\r\nFrom late September through to the completion of the repair work in late March the Hasta Manyana was forced to shut as it became inaccessible to its patrons. Bert and Ernie estimate that the damage to the Pride of Manyana has cost them in excess of $800,000 and may have to file for bankruptcy.\r\nBert and Ernie have been advised that since no damage was done to the Hasta Manyana and they did not own the Pride of Manyana they have no cause of action to recover damages for their losses.\r\nDo you agree with this advice? Why or why not?\n\nBert and Ernie’s livelihood depends on the STA’s pontoon, which was negligently damaged by Jim Henson.\nThe restaurant had to close for several months due to the inaccessibility caused by the pontoon’s repairs.\nReasonable Foreseeability of Loss\n\nBert and Ernie’s restaurant was the only establishment dependent on the Pride of Manyana for customer access.\nIt could be reasonably foreseeable that damaging the pontoon would harm their business.\n\n\nAvoid Indeterminate Liability\n\nThe liability would not be indeterminate, as it’s specific to Bert and Ernie, who are directly affected by the pontoon’s operational status.\nSTA and Jim Henson could potentially measure the economic impact on the Hasta Manyana based on past revenue and projections.\n\n\nAllow Autonomy to Pursue Legitimate Business Interests\n\nRecognizing a duty of care here would not significantly restrict the STA or Jim Henson’s ability to pursue legitimate business or personal interests.\n\nHowever, it would encourage responsible behavior, particularly for the STA as a provider of public infrastructure and for Jim Henson in obeying instructions from authorities.\n\n\n\n\nVulnerability of Plaintiff\n\nBert and Ernie are vulnerable as their livelihood is entirely dependent on the operation of the Pride of Manyana, which they don’t own or control.\nTheir vulnerability is heightened by the fact that there are no alternate routes to their restaurant.\n\n\nKnowledge &amp; Control of Defendant\n\nJim Henson was explicitly warned against his actions by STA personnel, showing a level of awareness and control over the situation.\nThe STA owns and operates the Pride of Manyana, also indicating a level of control and knowledge of its importance for local businesses.\n\n\nBREACH\n\nDriver was driving negligently, but for pontoon being destroyed, no economic loss\n\n\nCAUSATION\n\nScope of liability\n\nAppropriate\n\n\nNovus actus\n\nMarch v stramare\n\n\n\n\nREMOTENESS\n\nWas the harm of a kind that was reasonably foreseeable\n\nIf yes, damage not too remote\nManner of injury\nEggshell skull rule\n\n\n\n\nDEFENCES\n\ncontributory negligence - maybe\nNot inherent enough\n\n\n\nB. Dr. Bob is an investment advisor and the host of a radio program on investment strategies. His program, which runs on a local radio station on Sunday mornings, is called ‘Penny Wise and Dollar Clever.’ In November last year, Dr Bob declared on his program that ‘if ever anyone wanted to buy Telstra shares this is the time’. He went on to say that:\r\n‘The Telco is certainly one of the best and most efficient in the world today. It is a great investment for the mum and dad investors of Australia. The shares are definitely underpriced and those who get in now will make a good profit.’\r\nKermit who is a regular listener to the program and subscribes to Penny Wise and Dollar Clever investment magazine rang Dr. Bob and indicated that he was keen to invest in Telstra but that he was worried that changes in the senior management and problems in the Telstra board might cause the share price to drop dramatically.\r\nDr. Bob responded by saying: ‘Telstra is as solid as an old telephone booth. Not even the resignation of the CEO will make a difference to the share price.’ Kermit subsequently purchased 320,000 worth of Telstra shares. Some months later the CEO of Telstra resigned, the share price of the company dropped significantly. Kermit lost 125,000.\r\nKermit wishes to know if he can bring an action against Dr. Bob. Advise Kermit.\n\nReasonable Foreseeability of Loss\n\nDr. Bob is an investment advisor who specifically endorsed Telstra shares as a stable investment.\nIt could be reasonably foreseeable that listeners like Kermit would rely on Dr. Bob’s advice, potentially leading to economic loss if the advice was incorrect.\n\n\nAvoid Indeterminate Liability\n\nThe liability might be more difficult to determine here as Dr. Bob’s radio program and investment magazine are available to a wide audience.\nHowever, the one-on-one conversation between Kermit and Dr. Bob adds a more direct form of guidance, perhaps limiting the scope of liability to those who sought personalized advice.\n\n\nAllow Autonomy to Pursue Legitimate Business Interests\n\nHolding Dr. Bob liable might interfere with his professional autonomy and discourage investment advisors from offering opinions.\nHowever, a duty of care could incentivize responsible and well-researched advice.\n\n\nVulnerability of Plaintiff\n\nKermit is vulnerable in that he relies on expert advice to make investment decisions and has no way of controlling Telstra’s share prices or internal management decisions.\nHe did his own research on Telstra and asked questions over concerned\ngreat investment for the mum and dad investors of Australia\n\nDid not tell dr how much he would invest, dr might have assumed a reasonable amount\n\n\nNothing indicates kermit is vulnerable, and brought his own information\n\n\nKnowledge &amp; Control of Defendant\n\nDr. Bob offered specific advice to Kermit in a private conversation, going so far as to downplay the impact of management changes on share prices.\nThis could indicate a level of control and knowledge on Dr. Bob’s part, making him more liable.\n\n\n\nWeek 12:\nVicarious Liability, Non-Delegable Duties, Concurrent and Proportionate Liability\r\nPlease prepare answers to the following questions before your class this week, and be prepared to discuss them in class.\r\nQuestions\n\nWhat are the factors which create the legal relationship of employer and employee?\n\nThe relevant factors that have been identified by the High Court include:\n\nscope for control by the employer;\nthe description of the position in any written or verbal contract;\nthe right to suspend or dismiss;\nthe right to dictate the place of work, hours of work and the like;\nwhether tools are supplied and maintained by the ‘employer’ (this would indicate an employee as opposed to an independent contractor who may bring and maintain their own tools);\nthe right to the exclusive services of the person engaged;\n\nwhether work may be freely sub-contracted to someone else (if this may be done, it indicates an independent contractor);\n\n\nmode of remuneration: whether a traditional wage is paid (indicates employee) as opposed to a commission, retainer, or being paid on invoice (independent contractor); and\nwhat forms of tax/superannuation are paid and by whom are they paid.\n\n\n\n\nHow has the nature of “employment” evolved over time?\n\nChanges in degrees of control over employees + WHF\n\n\nWhat is the difference between a “contract of service” and a “contract for services”? Note: the significance of this question is that where a statute uses a phrase that has an established legal meaning, the parliament is presumed to have intended the legal meaning. The term “contract of service” is used in the Workers Compensation Act 1987.\n\nControl for services (CONTRACTOR) vs control of service (EMPLOYEE)\n\nThe essence of a contract of service is the supply of the work and skill of a man.\nThe High Court stated that the classic test for determining whether there is a contract of service as opposed to a contract for services is the degree of control which one person has over the other.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the meaning of the expression “in the course of employment”? How how this concept evolved from Bugge v Brown and Deatons v Flew through to Prince Alfred College and Schokman?\n\nIf person is there due to employer engaged person to be or engaged to participate in\nHesley hall\n\nLord Steyn described the sexual abuse in that case as ‘inextricably interwoven’ with the employee’s performance of his duties (230) and accordingly within the course of employment\n\n\nLesmore\n\nby a majority of 5 to 1 the High Court allowed an appeal by a school authority deciding that a school authority may be vicariously liable for sexual assault by a teacher on the basis of it being within the course of employment.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a “non-delegable” duty of care and what are its consequences?\n\nA non-delegable duty def is one where a defendant is not able to delegate a duty to take care of someone else.\n\nA hospital has a non-delegable duty of care to its public patients and that duty cannot be delegated through the careful selection of an independent contractor.\nHospital/patient – Ellis v Wallsend District Hospital (1989) 17 NSWLR 553; Albrighton v RPAH [1980] 2 NSWLR 542\nSchool authority/student – Commonwealth v Introvigne (1982) 150 CLR 258;\nLand occupier/danger to neighbour – Burnie v General Jones Pty Ltd (1994)179 CLR 520\n\n\n\n\nHow do the courts determine when a duty is non-delegable?\n\nIn Stevens v Brodribb Sawmilling Co Pty Ltd (1986) 160 CLR 16,\n\nthe High Court held that the totality of the relationship between the parties must be considered and decided that there is no single ‘checklist’ of indicia to distinguish the relationship between employer-employee or employer-independent contractor.\n\n\n\n\nExplain what is meant by “joint and several liability”.\n\njoint and several liability in claims for pure economic loss or damage to property caused by failure to take reasonable care.\nwhere multiple parties are responsible for a particular debt or damages, and each party can be held individually liable for the entire amount, allowing the claimant to recover the full sum from any one of the liable parties.\n\n\nExplain the concept of “contribution between tortfeasors”? How are relative contributions determined?\n\nwhere multiple parties who are jointly liable for a tortious act can seek contributions from each other to equitably share the damages awarded, with relative contributions typically determined by the court based on factors like the degree of fault, the severity of the negligence, and the extent of involvement in the harm caused.\n\nContribution between tortfeasors\n\nHunt v Hunt\nChapman v Hearse\nThe common law rule in Merryweather v Nixan (1799) 8 Term Rep 186; 101 ER 1337\n\nwas that there was no right to contribution between tortfeasors.\nSo, a tortfeasor against whom a judgment was obtained or with whom a settlement was reached and who was liable to pay the whole of the plaintiff’s damages had no right to require a contribution from any other tortfeasor.\nThe effect of the rule in Merryweather v Nixan has been abrogated by statute in all Australian jurisdictions\n\n\nLAW REFORM (MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) ACT 1946 s 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between “joint and several liability” and “proportionate liability”?\n\nIn New South Wales, “joint and several liability” means that each defendant can be held fully responsible for the entire amount of damages, whereas “proportionate liability” allocates responsibility for damages among multiple defendants based on their respective degrees of fault.\n\nJoint and several: each defendant is potentially liable for the full amount, allowing the plaintiff to recover the entire sum from any one of the defendants who can then seek contributions from the others.\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 12:\nProblem question\nFor many years, SES has operated as a courier company in Sydney. The company has many employees on its payroll working as deliverymen and women. Two years ago, due to a rapid expansion in business, SES engaged the services of four subcontractors to do part of the deliveries for the company. Bradley Wiggins is one of these subcontractors.\r\nThere is no written contract between SES and individual subcontractors. Subcontractors are also free to work for other companies. However, because of the volume of work from SES, its subcontractors are fully occupied and do not need to work for any other companies. It is the policy of SES that each sub-contractor should own a two-ton van for the delivery work. SES also provides finance to subcontractors to purchase the vans. However, subcontractors are under no obligation to take or accept such finance.\r\nIt is also the policy of SES that each owner-driver has his or her vehicle painted in SES colours and bear the SES logo. SES pays for the costs of such painting and signs on the vehicles. To ensure a smooth operation, SES encourages all its subcontractors to use vehicle maintenance and refuelling services provided by SES. The cost of the fuel and maintenance services are deducted from the payments to the subcontractors.\r\nSES requires all subcontractors to report for work at the SES headquarters at 7.15 am. each morning. The subcontractors are also obliged to make themselves available for work till 7.15 p.m. While on their delivery rounds, all subcontractors remain in touch with SES head office by means mobile phones supplied by SES. All SES subcontractors are paid on the basis of kilometres travelled for deliveries. None of the subcontractors is on the superannuation scheme organised by SES.\r\nMr Wiggins’ first job one day recently was to deliver a package to Lindfield High School. After entering the school by the front gate, Mr. Wiggins fell into a ditch which was partially obscured by long grass. He fractured his hip badly and now requires hip replacement surgery. He has been advised that because of severe muscular and tissue damage he will probably have ongoing problems.\r\nThe ditch had been dug by employees of North Shore Plumbing Pty Ltd, who were working on upgrading connections for the High School. Despite persistent requests from the Headmistress that the plumbers should put a protective barrier around the ditch, they had failed to do so. The headmistress had also advised SES to use the back entrance to the school because of the ditch near the front gate, but SES failed to pass on this information on to Mr Wiggins.\r\nWhen the headmistress tried to contact North Shore Plumbing following the accident, she learned that the business was likely to go in to liquidation, and was also uninsured.\r\n(a) Is Mr Wiggins an employee so that he would have a claim for workers compensation in respect of his injury?\n\nNot an employee, no super, free to work for other companies, own their own vans, no written contract, etc.\nThe cost of the fuel and maintenance services are deducted from the payments to the subcontractors.\n\n(b) Identify any common law negligence claims Mr Wiggins could bring for personal injury damages?\r\nSES\n\nNovel duty (iff not employee) (omission to tell him)\r\nWiggins\nJoint and seperate liability claim against SES and School and plumber\r\nHeadmistress\nSchool → occupier lawful entrant\nNon-delegable duty\n\nReasonable steps required to confirm safety\nNot neighbors - so only normal duty of care\r\nPlumbers\n\n\nHaley v London Electricity Board\n"},"index":{"title":"Law School Notes Repository","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Welcome to My Law School Notes Repository\nWelcome to my comprehensive collection of law school notes.
