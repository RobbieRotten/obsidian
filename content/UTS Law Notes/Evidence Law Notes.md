Week 1: Evidence Overview

## Week 1: Evidence Overview 

- Evidence: Evifilta
  - 
- Evidence
  - What is evidence?
    - Evidence is the information (facts) received by the Court in its efforts to determine the existence of some other matter of fact. Sometimes referred to as a proof model.
    - “it encompasses, in my view, at least all of those matters which one party must prove in order to succeed in the proceeding and that the other must prove to establish its defence” per Branson J
  - Why do we need rules / laws that govern the use of evidence?
  - Three main reasons:
    - Fairness – a way of ensuring that the parties are treated fairly. 
    - Efficiency – a way of limiting extraneous material to ensure the effective and efficient conduct of Court matters.
    - Standardisation – allows for a degree of standardisation across all Court matters (consistency and certainty).
  - Uniform Evidence Legislation
    - Originally we had the Common Law Rules of Evidence – very complicated, convoluted and difficult to apply. 
    - In the 1980’s ALRC conducted inquiry into problems associated with evidence.
      - Resulted in Uniform Evidence Acts (1995) in NSW and Cth jurisdictions
      - Since that time other States and Territories have adopted the approach. 
      - Although the various Acts are described as ‘Uniform’, there are some differences between them. 
  - Evidence Act Structure
    - In NSW, the use of evidence in both Criminal and Civil matters is governed by the Uniform Evidence Act 1995 (EA)
    - Structure of EA is designed to allow for a more systematic approach to the assessment of admissibility. 
    - Under the EA, every piece of evidence needs to be rigorously assessed to assess whether, or not, it is admissible.
    - Broken into major Chapters including:
      - Chapter 1 - Preliminary matters (application of the Act)
      - Chapter 2 - Adducing evidence
      - Chapter 3 - Admissibility
      - Chapter 4 - Proof 
    - Under the EA, evidence may be classified as either:
      - - Testimonial (oral / written evidence given by a Witness) (oath by one’s testicles)
      - - Documents (papers, electronic recording etc)
      - - Other evidence (views, re-enactments, real evidence - eg the weapon)
    - EA allows the Court to ensure that facts are proven in a methodical and consistent manner.
    - Under the Uniform Evidence Act 1995 (EA) evidence is based on admissibility through:
      - The concept of Relevance.
      - The use of Exclusionary Rules.
      - The Use of Discretionary Rules.
    - Aim is to be more ‘Inclusionary’ than ‘Exclusionary’.
  - Admissibility – A 3-Stage Process
    - In assessing the admissibility of evidence, the Court undertakes a three-stage process where each threshold must be met before moving to the next step:
      - 1. Relevant / Not Relevant?
      - 2. If Relevant, are there any Exclusionary Rules that apply?
      - 3. If no Exclusionary Rule applies, should the Trial Judge use Discretion to exclude the evidence?
    - Evifilta
      - 
- Documentary Evidence Real Evidence
  - Documents Generally
    - Understanding how documents can be used in Court / Litigation is an important skill for a lawyer to possess. Can be a very potent tool when handled correctly.
    - Many forms of litigation rely heavily on documents being adduced as evidence.
    - EA made significant changes to the Common Law about how documents can be adduced. Common Law was very strict on the notion of only using original documents.
    - Part 2.2 of the EA deals with how the contents of documents can be adduced. Deals with how originals, copies, extracts, summaries etc can be tendered in order to bring the contents of the document before the Court. 
    - Should be noted that proving the content of a document is a different issue to how the content of the document is used/assessed in evidence. Getting the content of the document into evidence should be considered the first step.
  - Definition of “Document”
    - In the Dictionary of the EA
    - "document" means any record of information, and includes: 
    - (a) anything on which there is writing, or 
    - (b) anything on which there are marks, figures, symbols or perforations having a meaning for persons qualified to interpret them, or 
    - (c) anything from which sounds, images or writings can be reproduced with or without the aid of anything else, or 
    - (d) a map, plan, drawing or photograph. 
  - Clause 8 Part 2 of the Dictionary:
    - References to documents 
      - A reference in this Act to a document includes a reference to:
        - (a) any part of the document, or 
        - (b) any copy, reproduction or duplicate of the document or of any part of the document, or 
        - (c) any part of such a copy, reproduction or duplicate
    - Proof of Contents of Documents
      - Main guidance as to the various ways that the contents of a document can be brought into evidence are dealt with under s 48 EA.
      - Under the EA, it is possible to:
        - -Tender the document itself 
          - – s 48(1)
        - -Tender a copy of it 
          - – s 48(1)(b)
        - -Adduce evidence as to its contents 
          - – s 48(1)(a)
        - -Tender a transcript of it 
          - – s 48(1)(c)
        - -For voluminous documents, it is also possible to tender a summary (with leave) 
          - – s 50.
      - s 48 also provides a way of utilising the contents of a document even though the document in question is not available to the party. (ss 48(2) and 48(4) refer)
    - Section 48(4) Proof of Contents of Documents
      - s 48(4) A party may adduce evidence of the contents of a document in question that is not available to the party, or the existence and contents of which are not in issue in the proceeding, by:
        - (a) tendering a document that is a copy of, or an extract from or summary of, the document in question, or 
        - (b) adducing from a witness evidence of the contents of the document in question.
        - [See R v Cassar and Sleiman (No 28) [1999] NSWSC 651]
    - Definition of “unavailable”
      - Part 2 of the Dictionary: 5 Unavailability of documents and things 
      - For the purposes of this Act, a document or thing is taken not to be available to a party if and only if: 
        - (a) it cannot be found after reasonable inquiry and search by the party, or 
        - (b) it was destroyed by the party, or by a person on behalf of the party, otherwise than in bad faith, or was destroyed by another person, or 
        - (c) it would be impractical to produce the document or thing during the course of the proceeding, or 
        - (d) production of the document or thing during the course of the proceeding could render a person liable to conviction for an offence, or 
        - (e) it is not in the possession or under the control of the party and: 
          - (i) it cannot be obtained by any judicial procedure of the court, or 
          - (ii) it is in the possession or under the control of another party to the proceeding concerned who knows or might reasonably be expected to know that evidence of the contents of the document, or evidence of the thing, is likely to be relevant in the proceeding, or 
          - (iii) it was in the possession or under the control of such a party at a time when that party knew or might reasonably be expected to have known that such evidence was likely to be relevant in the proceeding. 
    - R v Cassar & Sleiman [1999] NSWSC 651
      - D’s claimed that on the night of the incident they were driving around in a car. 
        - P was given leave to adduce evidence in reply that would show car was elsewhere on that night. 
        - Police had evidence that car was at a motel at the time. 
        - What was this evidence and how was it adduced?
      - Evidence was contained in a motel registration form which recorded name, address, car rego, check in date and room charge. 
        - Problem was that the registration form could not be found and therefore could not be produced as evidence, at trial. 
      - Evidence regarding existence of such registration forms and their general content was given by the motel employee, on duty that night.
      - Evidence as to the content of the registration form was given by police officer who had inspected the original registration form and recorded the name, address, vehicle registration and payment details etc on a piece of paper. 
        - This information was then faxed to another police officer who recorded it on a ‘running sheet’. 
        - Sadly, the piece of paper and the fax of it could not be found at trial. 
      - Only remaining evidence was the police running sheet. The question was whether that was admissible to prove the contents of the original motel registration form ???? 
      - Court held that:
        - 1. Section 48(4)(a) provides that a party may adduce evidence of the contents of a document that is not available by tendering a document that is a summary of, or an extract from, the document in question. The running sheet was therefore admissible (it incorporated the salient details) pursuant to s 48(4)(a). 
        - 2. The police officer should have leave, pursuant to s 42 EA, to use the running sheet to try to revive his memory. 
        - 3. The police officer could then give oral evidence of what he saw recorded in the original registration form pursuant to s 48(4)(b), using the running sheet to refresh his recollection. 
        - 4. The registration form was a business record of the kind referred to in s 69EA and that proof of the contents of the form would be evidence of the fact. 
  - Real Evidence
    - Real Evidence
      - Under the EA there are two categories of Real Evidence identified.
        - -Exhibits (physical object tendered as evidence) 
        - -Views (demonstrations, experiments or inspections of locations).
      - EA makes it possible to adduce evidence other than through witness testimony or through documents - this includes physical, tangible objects such as the murder weapon. (s 52)
      - The other type of Real Evidence (generally referred to as Views) allows for the conduct of experiments, demonstrations and location inspections. (s 53)
      - Demonstrations / experiments / inspections can be very powerful evidence so the Court needs to be satisfied that the evidence gained will assist the Court in its deliberations and will not be unfairly prejudicial to the parties (particularly to the Defendant in a Criminal matter). 
      - Important to ensure procedural fairness is observed and that the evidence is able to be tested or commented upon like all other pieces of evidence.
      - Neither the Judge or any member of the Jury is permitted to conduct a View outside of the rules in s 53 (Bilal Skaf’s case)
      - The factors that the Judge needs to consider when contemplating whether to conduct a View are set out in s 53(3).
      - s 53 does not apply to in-court demonstrations: Evans v The Queen (2007) 235 CLR 521
        - Under s 54 the Court may draw any reasonable inference from what it sees, hears or otherwise notices during a demonstration, experiment or inspection.
    - Section 53 - Views
      - (1) A judge may, on application, order that a demonstration, experiment or inspection be held. 
      - (2) A judge is not to make an order unless he or she is satisfied that: 
        - (a) the parties will be given a reasonable opportunity to be present, and 
        - (b) the judge and, if there is a jury, the jury will be present. 
      - (3) Without limiting the matters that the judge may take into account in deciding whether to make an order, the judge is to take into account the following: 
        - (a) whether the parties will be present, 
        - (b) whether the demonstration, experiment or inspection will, in the court’s opinion, assist the court in resolving issues of fact or understanding the evidence, 
        - (c) the danger that the demonstration, experiment or inspection might be unfairly prejudicial, might be misleading or confusing or might cause or result in undue waste of time, 
        - (d) in the case of a demonstration—the extent to which the demonstration will properly reproduce the conduct or event to be demonstrated,
        - (e) in the case of an inspection—the extent to which the place or thing to be inspected has materially altered. 
      - (4) The court (including, if there is a jury, the jury) is not to conduct an experiment in the course of its deliberations. 
      - (5) This section does not apply in relation to the inspection of an exhibit by the court or, if there is a jury, by the jury.
    - Views
      - R v Milat (1996) (unreported)
      - R v Bilal Skaf, R v Mohammed Skaf [2004] NSWCCA 37
      - Evans v R [2007] HCA 59
    - Bilal Skaf Case
      - Note - The Court is not permitted to go outside the evidence presented and to act upon information privately obtained which the parties have no chance of combating or commenting upon.
      - In a Sexual Assault (Rape) case the Trial Judge gave his usual warning to the members of the Jury at the conclusion of the Trial. As part of this warning, the Judge instructed the Jury not to "go and do your own research". 
      - But despite the warning, the 64-year-old Jury Foreman rang another Juror the night before the verdict was delivered and they went to the park where the alleged rape occurred. 
      - The two Jurors went to Gosling Park for about 20 minutes to check the lighting conditions (obviously an issue that had been causing some concern to the Jury).
      - At the Trial, the two Jurors had not told the Judge or anybody else what they had done.
      - At a BBQ some time later, the Foreman told a Solicitor that he and another had gone to the park. The Foreman said he only went to the park to `clarify something for my own mind‘. Quite correctly, the Solicitor reported the conversation to the NSW Sheriff.
      - As a result, the matter went to Appeal and the Judges in the NSWCCA found the experiment was a miscarriage of justice. 
        - "In our view there must, regrettably, be a new trial because of this ground," the judges said. 
      - They also ordered that in future more specific orders be given to Juries to ensure further trials were not miscarried because of ‘Jury misconduct’.
      - NSWCCA stated that orders should include:
        - not making private visits to the crime scene;
        - not asking other Jurors to conduct experiments; and
        - informing the Trial Judge if they discover fellow Jurors making independent inquiries into the case.
      - The NSWCCA decision to order a retrial led to the NSW Government to amend the Jury Act – amendment allows for the punishment of those who conduct unauthorised experiments away from court. 
  - Three types of evidence
    - Oral testimony, documents, real evidence
  - R v L Cassar; R v E Sleiman (Judgment No 28) [1999] NSWSC 651
    - Court: Supreme Court of New South Wales
    - Judge: Sperling J
    - Parties: Regina v Leanne Cassar; Regina v Emad Sleiman
    - Key Issues:
      - The admissibility of secondary evidence, specifically a police running sheet, to prove the contents of a lost motel registration form.
      - Whether a witness could use a document prepared by another to refresh their memory.
    - Decision:
      - The court held that the running sheet was admissible under section 48(4)(a) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) as a summary of the original document, which was unavailable.
      - The court granted leave for a police officer to use the running sheet to refresh his memory under section 32 of the Act, allowing him to provide oral evidence of the contents of the lost registration form.
    - Significance:
      - The case illustrates the application of sections 32 and 48 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) concerning the admissibility of secondary evidence and the conditions under which a witness can refresh their memory using documents not prepared by them.
  - Case Summary: Evans v The Queen [2007] HCA 59
    - Court: High Court of Australia
    - Judges: Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne, and Heydon JJ
    - Judgment Date: 13 December 2007
    - Parties: Evans (Appellant) v The Queen (Respondent)
    - Procedural History:
      - Evans was convicted of armed robbery in a lower court.
      - The conviction was based in part on an in-court demonstration where Evans was required to wear clothing similar to that worn by the offender and to speak words alleged to have been spoken during the robbery.
      - Evans appealed to the High Court, arguing that the demonstration was inadmissible due to its prejudicial nature.
    - Facts:
      - Evans was accused of an armed robbery where the offender was described as wearing overalls, a balaclava, and sunglasses.
      - During the trial, the prosecution had Evans wear similar clothing and speak specific words in front of the jury to compare with witness descriptions.
      - The defense argued that this demonstration was prejudicial and did not have sufficient probative value.
    - Legal Issue:
      - Whether the in-court demonstration was admissible, considering the balance between its probative value and potential prejudice to the accused.
    - Decision:
      - The High Court upheld the admissibility of the in-court demonstration.
      - The Court found the demonstration relevant and useful for the jury in assessing the identity of the offender.
      - The probative value of the evidence was deemed to outweigh any potential for unfair prejudice.
    - Ratio Decidendi:
      - The admissibility of in-court demonstrations depends on the discretion of the judge, who must weigh the probative value of the evidence against the risk of prejudice.
      - In this case, the demonstration was relevant to the key issue of identity, and its potential prejudicial effect was not sufficient to exclude it from evidence.
    - Significance:
      - Evans v The Queen is an important case in evidence law, setting a precedent for the admissibility of in-court demonstrations.
      - It highlights the need for careful judicial balancing between the probative value of evidence and the risk of unfair prejudice to ensure a fair trial.
      - This case is often referenced in legal discussions concerning the limits and conditions for admitting similar in-court evidence.
## Week 2: Witnesses 

- R v Khan NSWSC 1995
  - Court: Supreme Court of New South Wales
  - Parties:
    - Prosecution: Regina (The Crown)
    - Defendant: Gulam Mohammad Khan
  - Procedural History:
    - Gulam Mohammad Khan was on trial for the murder of Mohammad Abbas. 
    - The Crown sought to compel Mr. Khan’s wife, Jatun Bibi Khan, to testify against her husband. 
  - Original Dispute:
    - The dispute originated from the events of 4 December 1993, when Gulam Mohammad Khan allegedly murdered Mohammad Abbas, who had been living with the Khan family. 
    - The prosecution aimed to call Mrs. Khan as a witness to testify about her relationship with Abbas and the circumstances surrounding the murder.
  - Reason for Trial:
    - The trial was convened to determine Mr. Khan’s guilt in the murder of Mohammad Abbas, with the Crown seeking to establish that the killing was not the result of a sudden loss of self-control (provocation) but rather a premeditated act of revenge.
  - Material Facts:
    - Mohammad Abbas, a friend of the Khan family, had been living with them for some time. During Mr. Khan’s absence in Fiji, Mrs. Khan’s relationship with Abbas grew closer, and they became sexually involved shortly before the murder. 
    - On the night of the murder, Mr. Khan allegedly caught them together and, in a fit of rage, stabbed Abbas multiple times. Mrs. Khan’s initial statement to the police implicated her husband, but she later indicated that she would retract some of that statement if called to testify, claiming that her involvement with Abbas was coerced.
  - Issue Raised:
    - The central issue was whether the court should compel Mrs. Khan to testify against her husband despite her objection, balancing the harm that might be caused to the marital relationship against the need for her testimony in the interests of justice.
  - Law(s)/Statute(s) in Contention:
    - Section 18 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW): 	
      - This section allows a court to compel a witness, including a spouse, to testify even if they object, provided that the court determines the necessity of the evidence outweighs any potential harm to the witness or their relationship with the defendant.
    - Section 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW): 
      - This section provides the court with discretion to exclude evidence if its probative value is outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice to the defendant.
  - Precedences:
    - Richardson v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 116: The Crown referenced this case in arguing that Mrs. Khan’s prior statement to the police could be used as evidence, even if she recanted it during her testimony.
    - R v Blewitt (1988) 62 ALR 503: This case was cited regarding the admissibility of prior statements when a witness deviates from their earlier testimony.
  - Tests:
    - The court applied the balancing test outlined in section 18(6) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), considering the potential harm to Mrs. Khan and her marital relationship against the importance of her testimony to the Crown’s case.
  - Words and Phrases Considered:
    - "Provocation": The defense centered on whether Mr. Khan acted under sudden provocation upon discovering his wife with Abbas, which could reduce his culpability from murder to manslaughter.
    - "Harm to relationship": The court considered the nature of the harm that compelling Mrs. Khan to testify might cause to her marital relationship.
  - Arguments by Party:
    - Prosecution: Argued that Mrs. Khan’s testimony was crucial to establishing the sequence of events leading to Abbas’s death, particularly to counter the defense’s claim of provocation. 
      - The Crown also contended that Mrs. Khan’s initial police statement could be treated as evidence under the new Evidence Act, even if she retracted it on the stand.
    - Defense: Argued that compelling Mrs. Khan to testify would cause significant harm to her marital relationship, which still endured despite the charges. 
      - The defense also suggested that her testimony would lack credibility and that its key points could be corroborated by other evidence, making it unnecessary to compel her testimony.
  - Judicial Opinions:
    - The court, presided over by Justice Abadee, weighed the arguments presented by both parties. 
    - Justice Abadee acknowledged the potential importance of Mrs. Khan’s testimony but ultimately decided that the harm to her relationship with her husband outweighed the benefits of compelling her testimony.
  - Legal Reasoning:
    - The court reasoned that although Mrs. Khan’s testimony could be relevant to the issue of provocation, the potential harm to the marital relationship was significant. 
    - The court also noted that much of the evidence Mrs. Khan could provide was available from other sources, including the defendant’s own statements to the police and other witnesses. 
    - Therefore, the court chose not to compel Mrs. Khan to testify, as the damage to the marriage outweighed the evidentiary value her testimony might provide.
  - Ratio Decidendi:
    - The court’s decision was based on the principle that the harm likely to be caused to Mrs. Khan’s marital relationship by compelling her to testify outweighed the desirability of having her evidence presented in court. 
    - The ruling emphasized the court's discretion under section 18 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), prioritizing the protection of personal relationships where the evidentiary value does not justify the potential harm.
  - Result:
    - The court ruled that Mrs. Khan would not be compelled to testify against her husband, and her prior statement to the police was not admitted as evidence.
  - Relevance to Modern Law:
    - This case remains relevant in discussions about the limits of compelling testimony from unwilling witnesses, especially within family contexts. 
    - It highlights the judiciary’s role in safeguarding personal relationships from undue harm during legal proceedings and serves as a precedent for similar cases involving the compellability of spousal testimony.
## Lecture 2A: Witness Competence and Compellability

  - Witness Competence & Compellability
    - Who can give evidence ?
    - Who must give evidence ?
    - Evidence – Sworn / Affirmed / Unsworn
    - Child Witness
  - Who can give evidence ?
    - The legal ability to give evidence is referred to as ‘Competence’.
    - Competence def = ability to give a rational reply to questions about facts.
    - Except as otherwise provided by the Evidence Act: 
      - every person is presumed to be ‘competent’ to give evidence unless some form of exception applies. (s 12(a) EA)
    - Exceptions to the presumption:
      - Those lacking capacity to give evidence about a fact owing to a mental, intellectual or physical disability. (s 13 EA)
      - The Accused is not competent to give evidence for Prosecution. (s 17(2) refers)
    - Section 13 Competence: lack of capacity
      - (1) A person is not competent to give evidence about a fact if, for any reason (including mental, intellectual or physical disability):
        - a. the person does not have the capacity to understand a question about the fact, or
        - b. the person does not have the capacity to give an answer that can be understood in relation to a question about the fact.
      - and that incapacity cannot be overcome (see ss 30 & 31)
  - Who must give evidence?
    - A person who is competent to give evidence about a fact is compellable to give that evidence. (s 12(b) EA)
    - If a person is a compellable Witness, they may be legally forced to give evidence despite being reluctant to do so.
    - Various exceptions to compellability may apply:
      - The Accused in his own Trial - s 17(1)
      - Co-Accused (if not given separate Trial) – s 17(3)
      - Sovereign / Governor-General / Governor – s 15(1)
      - Members of Parliament (if sitting) – s 15(2)
      - Close relatives of the Accused (eg. Spouse) – s 18 & s 19*
      - Judges / Jurors (in trial in which they were acting) – s 16
    - Compellability – Close Relatives
      - In criminal proceedings a close relative of A may object to being compelled to give evidence for P (s 18 EA).
        - See s 18(2) for classification of ‘close relative’
      - If there is an objection, the W must not give evidence if the Court finds that:
        - a) There is a likelihood of harm to either W or the relationship; and
        - b) The nature / extent of the harm outweighs the desirability of having the evidence (s 18(6) refers).
      - When undertaking this balancing exercise, the Court is to have regard to the matters set out in s 18(7).
      - *** s 18 does not apply in relation to certain offences in relation to children (see s 19 EA)
      - s 18(7) Without limiting the matters that may be taken into account by the court for the purposes of subsection (6), it must take into account the following:
        - (a) the nature and gravity of the offence for which the defendant is being prosecuted,
        - (b) the substance and importance of any evidence that the person might give and the weight that is likely to be attached to it,
        - (c) whether any other evidence concerning the matters to which the evidence of the person would relate is reasonably available to the prosecutor,
        - (d) the nature of the relationship between the defendant and the person, 
        - (e) whether, in giving the evidence, the person would have to disclose matter that was received by the person in confidence from the defendant.
  - Evidence – Sworn / Affirmed / Unsworn
    - Sworn Evidence
      - A Witness who is competent to give evidence is required to give ‘sworn’ evidence.
      - Before giving evidence, the Witness must take an ‘Oath’ or make an ‘Affirmation’ that they will tell the truth (s 21 EA).
        - I swear by Almighty God that the evidence I shall give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
        - I solemnly and sincerely declare and affirm that the evidence I shall give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
    - Section 21 - Sworn evidence to be on oath or affirmation
      - (1) A witness in a proceeding must either take an oath, or make an affirmation, before giving evidence.
      - (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to a person who gives unsworn evidence under section 13.
      - (3) A person who is called merely to produce a document or thing to the court need not take an oath or make an affirmation before doing so.
      - (4) The witness is to take the oath, or make the affirmation, in accordance with the appropriate form in Schedule 1 or in a similar form.
      - (5) Such an affirmation has the same effect for all purposes as an oath.
    - Evidence – Sworn / Unsworn
      - Unsworn Evidence
        - Despite the fact that W may be able give a coherent / comprehensible answer to a question, there may be an issue regarding W’s ability to understand their obligation to tell the truth.
          - In this situation W is unable to give sworn evidence under s 13(3). However, in certain circumstances W may still be able to give unsworn evidence.
        - Pursuant to s 13(4), a person who is otherwise incompetent to give ‘sworn’ evidence may give ‘unsworn’ evidence if the matters in s 13(5) have been conveyed to W.
    - Section 13 Competence: lack of capacity
      - (3) A person who is competent to give evidence about a fact is not competent to give sworn evidence about the fact if the person does not have the capacity to understand that, in giving evidence, he or she is under an obligation to give truthful evidence.
      - (4) A person who is not competent to give sworn evidence about a fact may, subject to subsection
      - (5), be competent to give unsworn evidence about the fact.
        - (5) A person who, because of subsection (3), is not competent to give sworn evidence is competent to give unsworn evidence if the court has told the person:
          - (a) That it is important to tell the truth, and
          - (b) That he or she may be asked question that he or she does not know, or cannot remember, the answer to, and that he or she should tell the court if this occurs, and
          - (c) That he or she may be asked questions that suggest certain statements are true or untrue and that he or she should agree with the statements that he or she believes are true and should feel no pressure to agree with statements that he or she believes are untrue. [...]
      - *** There is no longer a requirement for W to acknowledge that they understand the effect of s 13(5).
    - Evidence – Sworn / Unsworn
      - Unsworn Evidence
        - Procedurally, unsworn evidence given by W is treated in exactly the same way as sworn evidence.
        - Despite the use of ‘may’ in s 13(4), the Court has no discretion to prevent the Witness from giving his / her unsworn evidence. 
          - SH v The Queen [2012] NSWCCA 79
        - There remains some question as to whether unsworn evidence should be given less weight – purely on the basis that it is unsworn 
          - (R v GW [2016] HCA 6, [54-57] refers).
  - Child Witness
    - CL traditionally regarded children as an unreliable class of witness, requiring that trial judges warn juries that it is dangerous to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of a child - perception being that children are prone to fantasy, highly suggestible, and likely to give inaccurate accounts of events
    - This position is no longer the case - research conducted in recent years demonstrates that children’s cognitive and recall skills are not inherently less reliable than that of adults.
    - In EA, the guidance relating to judicial warnings with respect to the evidence given by a Child Witness reflects current research
    - The EA now contains the following provisions in relation to judicial warnings and child witnesses:
      - –s 165(6) provides that warnings in relation to the reliability of a child’s evidence can only be given in accordance withs 165A.
      - –s 165A prohibits trial judges from warning or suggesting to juries that children (as a class) are unreliable witnesses or that it is generally dangerous to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of any child witness.

    - Documents and Real Evidence are tendered and if they conform to the Rules governing relevance and authenticity they will be admitted into evidence.
    - Before evidence will be accepted, there must be a basis for finding that the evidence is what it purports to be.
      - Very important requirement for Documentary Evidence, Real Evidence and Expert Evidence.
    - Court must not use information that was not part of the formal process of receiving evidence (Bilal Skaf case – Jurors undertaking ‘unofficial’ view)
  - Questioning Witnesses
    - Control of Examination by the Court
      - s 26 Court’s control over questioning of witnesses
      - The court may make such orders as it considers just in relation to:
        - (a) the way in which witnesses are to be questioned, and 
        - (b) the production and use of documents and things in connection with the questioning of witnesses, and
        - (c) the order in which parties may question a witness, and
        - (d) the presence and behaviour of any person in connection with the questioning of witnesses.
      - s 29 Manner and form of questioning witnesses and their responses
        - (1) A party may question a witness in any way the party thinks fit, except as provided by this Chapter or as directed by the court.
        - (2) A court may, on its own motion or on the application of the party that called the witness, direct that the witness give evidence wholly or partly in narrative form.
        - (3) Such a direction may include directions about the way in which evidence is to be given in that form.
        - (4) Evidence may be given in the form of charts, summaries or other explanatory material if it appears to the court that the material would be likely to aid its comprehension of other evidence that has been given or is to be given.
    - Adducing & Testing Testimonial Evidence
      - Three stage process used by Counsel (Lawyer) to adduce and test evidence:
        - Examination-in-Chief
        - Cross-Examination
        - Re-Examination
      - The Party who calls the Witness will commence by taking the Witness through his / her Evidence-in-Chief. (Non-leading questions)
      - The Opposing Party will test the evidence of Witness hoping to undermine it or bolster his / her own case. (Leading questions)
      - If need be, the first Party may re-examine the Witness in order to explain any points of confusion or unfavourable evidence. (Non-leading questions)
    - s 39 Limits on re-examination
      - On re-examination:
        - (a) a witness may be questioned about matters arising out of evidence given by the witness in cross-examination, and
        - (a) other questions may not be put to the witness unless the court grants leave (permission) to do so (Leave – s 192 EA).
    - Leading Questions
      - A Leading Question is a question asked of a Witness that:
        - directly or indirectly suggests a particular answer to the question, or assumes the existence of a fact the existence of which is in dispute in the proceeding and as to the existence of which the witness has not given evidence before the question is asked.
        - (EA Dictionary: Part 1 – Definitions)
    - Questioning Examples
      - Non-leading
        - – When was the last time you saw the woman ?
        - – How tall was the man that you saw ?
        - – What happened when you entered the bank?
      - Leading
        - – The last time you saw the woman was about noon?
        - – The man was approx 180cm tall, wasn’t he ?
        - – Is it true that when you entered the bank, a shot was fired by the Accused ?
    - s 42 Leading Questions
      - A party may ask a leading question of a witness in cross-examination unless the court disallows the question or directs the witness not to answer it. (s 42(1) refers).
      - When deciding whether to disallow the question, or give such a direction not to answer in accordance with s 42, the court may take into account the extent to which:
        - (a) the evidence given by the witness in examination-in-chief is unfavourable to the party who called the witness, and
        - (b) the witness has an interest that is consistent with an interest of the cross-examiner, and
        - (c) the witness is sympathetic to the party conducting the cross-examination, either generally or about a particular matter, and
        - (d) the witness’s age, or any mental, intellectual or physical disability to which the witness is subject, may affect the witness’s answers.
      - The factors in s 42(2)(a)-(c) allow a judge to disallow a question where there are reasons to believe that the witness is favourably inclined to the cross-examining party.
      - Arguably, s 42(2)(c) suggests that a question should be disallowed where there is a danger that the witness is unusually susceptible to suggestive questioning making the evidence unreliable.
      - Pursuant to s 42(3), the court is to disallow the question, or direct the witness not to answer it, if it is satisfied that the facts concerned would be better ascertained if leading questions were not used.
      - Should be noted that s 42 does not limit the court’s power to control leading questions (s 42(4) refers).
    - The Rule in Browne v Dunn
      - An essential aspect of fairness in court process is ensuring that one party has the opportunity to answer the claims or allegations of another. 
        - The opposing party must be put on notice of the case that they must answer.
      - To address this, the Rule in Browne v Dunn was developed which requires a cross-examining party that intends to contradict a witness by adducing other evidence, to put as much of their own case that concerns that witness to them, and if it is intended to suggest that a witness is not speaking the truth on a particular matter, that their attention is drawn to what will be suggested about it so that they might have an opportunity to explain.
      - Browne and Dunn is not a rule of evidence - it is a rule of procedural fairness.
    - Rule in Browne v Dunn
      - When W is giving evidence and you intend to call evidence that contradicts them, you must put the substance of that contradictory evidence to the witness during cross-examination and give them the opportunity to comment on it.
      - Unfair to deny W the opportunity of explaining a point that will later be used to invite criticism or disbelief in their evidence
      - Duty for parties to ‘put’ to W any matter that may be used to suggest their evidence is untruthful, unreliable or which contradicts their testimony
      - Can be done in a formal manner ‘I put it to you that...’ or it may be done in a more natural, conversational style as part of the general cross examination, such as ‘Isn’t it true that...’
      - Failure to observe may result in adverse consequences eg recall W, exclude evidence, jury direction, dismiss jury
  - The Rule in Browne v Dunn
    - If the Rule in Browne v Dunn is not observed, there are several different ways that the Court can deal with the issue:
      - – Prevent non-compliant party from submitting that opponent’s evidence should not be believed.
      - – Exclude evidence given by a non-compliant party.
      - – Recall Witness: s 46
      - – Allow cross-examination of non-compliant party
      - – Comment on non-compliance; lesser weight given to their evidence.
    - Marelic v Comcare [1993] FCA 599 provides a good overview of how the Rule in Browne v Dunn should be applied.
  - Reviving Memory
    - A witness must not, in the course of giving evidence, use a document to try to revive his or her memory about a fact or opinion unless the court gives leave (s 42).
    - Despites 42, in any criminal proceeding, a police officer may give evidence-in-chief for the prosecution by reading or being led through a written statement previously made by the police officer (s 43).
    - If a witness attempts to revive his / her memory ‘out of court’, the court may, on the request of a party, give directions that the documents / things used by the witness to revive his or her memory are produced to the party (s 44).
  - s 48 Unfavourable Witnesses
    - (1) A party who called a witness may, with the leave of the court, question the witness as though the party were cross-examining the witness, about:
      - (a) evidence given by the witness that is unfavourable to the party, or
      - (b) a matter of which the witness may reasonably be supposed to have knowledge and about which it appears to the court the witness is not, in examination in chief, making a genuine attempt to give evidence, or
      - (c) whether the witness has, at any time, made a prior inconsistent statement. [...]
  - s 41 - Improper Questions
    - The court must disallow a question put to a witness in cross-examination, or inform the witness that it need not be answered, if the court is of the opinion that the question is:
      - – Misleading, confusing, unduly annoying, harassing intimidating, offensive, oppressive, humiliating, repetitive.
      - – In a tone that is belittling, insulting, otherwise inappropriate.
      - – Has no basis other than a stereotype (sex, race, culture, ethnicity, age, mental, intellectual or physical disability)
  - s 43 Prior Inconsistent Statements of Witnesses
    - (1) A witness may be cross-examined about a prior inconsistent statement alleged to have been made by the witness...
    - (2) If, in cross-examination, a witness does not admit that he or she has made a prior inconsistent statement, the cross-examiner is not to adduce evidence of the statement otherwise than from the witness unless, in the cross-examination, the cross-examiner:
      - (a) informed the witness of enough of the circumstances of the making of the statement to enable the witness to identify the statement, and
      - (b) drew the witness’s attention to so much of the statement as is inconsistent with the witness’s evidence
  - R v Glasby [2000] NSWCCA 83 (22 June 2000)
    - Procedural History:
      - Garry Zane Glasby was convicted of murder in the Supreme Court of New South Wales on 11 June 1998. 
      - He was sentenced to life imprisonment. 
      - Glasby appealed both his conviction and sentence to the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal (NSWCCA) on several grounds, including the admissibility of his wife’s testimony, errors in jury directions, and the severity of his sentence.
    - Original Dispute:
      - The dispute arose from the murder of John Albert Thiessl, allegedly carried out by Garry Zane Glasby on 6 November 1994 as part of a contract killing arranged by the victim’s wife, Carmela Thiessl.
    - Reason for Trial:
      - Glasby was tried for the murder of John Albert Thiessl. 
      - The Crown's case was that the murder was premeditated and carried out for financial gain. 
      - Glasby pleaded not guilty, claiming he had no involvement in the murder.
    - Material Facts:
      - The Crown alleged that Carmela Thiessl contracted Glasby to kill her husband in exchange for a substantial sum of money.
      - Mrs. Suzette Glasby, the appellant's wife, was involved in luring the victim to his death and driving Glasby from the scene of the crime.
      - Evidence against Glasby included testimony from Mrs. Glasby, recorded conversations implying Glasby’s involvement, and circumstantial evidence linking him to the crime.
    - Issue Raised:
      - Whether the trial judge erred in compelling Mrs. Glasby to testify and allowing her cross-examination under s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995.
      - Whether the trial judge adequately instructed the jury on the use of hearsay evidence provided by Mrs. Glasby.
      - Whether the trial judge should have discharged the jury due to prejudicial comments made by Mrs. Glasby.
      - Whether the life sentence imposed on Glasby was manifestly excessive compared to the sentence imposed on Mrs. Glasby.
    - Law(s)/Statute(s) in Contention:
      - Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) – particularly ss 18, 38, and 60 (relating to compellability of witnesses, cross-examination, and hearsay).
      - Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 6(1) – regarding the application of the proviso in appeals.
      - Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 19A – relating to the imposition of life imprisonment for murder.
    - Precedences:
      - Lee v The Queen (1998) 195 CLR 594: Clarified the application of s 60 of the Evidence Act 1995, specifically regarding hearsay evidence.
      - Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465: Set out principles for imposing the maximum penalty, even in cases where worse examples of the crime might be conceivable.
    - Tests:
      - Test for Compellability under s 18 of the Evidence Act 1995: Whether a witness is compellable depends on factors like the likelihood of harm to the relationship and the balance of fairness.
      - Application of the Proviso in Criminal Appeals (s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act): Whether the error denied the accused a fair chance of acquittal.
    - Words and Phrases Considered:
      - "Compellable witness" – the statutory ability to require a spouse to testify, subject to certain conditions.
      - "Hearsay" – the legal rule regarding the admissibility of out-of-court statements to prove the truth of the matters asserted.
    - Arguments by Party:
      - Appellant (Glasby): Argued that his wife should not have been compelled to testify against him, that the trial judge failed to direct the jury correctly regarding hearsay evidence, and that the jury should have been discharged after Mrs. Glasby's prejudicial outbursts. He also argued that his life sentence was excessive compared to the sentence imposed on his wife.
      - Respondent (Crown): Defended the compellability of Mrs. Glasby under the Evidence Act 1995, justified the cross-examination under s 38, and argued that any trial errors were not fundamental and did not deny Glasby a fair trial. The Crown also defended the life sentence as appropriate given the gravity of the offence.
    - Judicial Opinions:
      - The judges concurred that Mrs. Glasby was a compellable witness and that her cross-examination was properly allowed. They acknowledged an error in jury directions regarding hearsay but concluded that the error did not result in a miscarriage of justice. 
      - The life sentence was deemed appropriate, and the disparity with Mrs. Glasby’s sentence was justified based on their respective roles in the crime.
    - Legal Reasoning:
      - The Court determined that s 18 of the Evidence Act 1995 applied retrospectively and that the trial judge properly exercised discretion in requiring Mrs. Glasby to testify. 
      - Regarding the hearsay issue, the Court accepted that the trial judge had not provided adequate directions to the jury, but the weight of other evidence meant that this error did not deny Glasby a fair trial. 
      - The Court also found that the trial judge’s refusal to discharge the jury was appropriate, given the instructions to disregard the prejudicial comments. 
      - The life sentence was upheld as proportionate to Glasby’s culpability.
    - Ratio Decidendi:
      - Mrs. Glasby was a compellable witness under the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), and the trial judge’s errors in jury directions did not amount to a miscarriage of justice due to the strength of the evidence against Glasby. 
      - The life sentence was appropriate given the premeditated nature of the crime and Glasby’s dominant role.
    - Result:
      - The appeal against conviction and sentence was dismissed. 
      - Glasby’s conviction for murder and life sentence were upheld by the Court.
    - Relevance to Modern Law:
      - This case highlights the application of the Evidence Act 1995 in compelling spousal testimony and underscores the impact of Lee v The Queen on the treatment of hearsay evidence in criminal trials. It reinforces the principle that errors in jury directions may not warrant overturning a conviction if the evidence against the accused is overwhelming. 
      - It also illustrates the court’s discretion in balancing issues of parity in sentencing between co-offenders.
## Week 3A: Calling Witnesses

  - Witnesses
    - One of the main ways that we still adduce evidence in Court is through the calling and questioning of Witness.
    - Need to have an understanding of relevant provisions and case law relating to:
      - Calling Witnesses
      - Effect of not calling evidence
  - Failure to Give or Call Evidence
    - How does the law address the fact that a party fails to call evidence that the party would reasonably be expected to ?
    - How does the law address the situation where the Defendant elects to remain silent at trial ? (This question will be addressed in the next lecture – s 20 EA Silence at Trial)
  - Calling Witnesses
    - In a trial, who is responsible for deciding what witnesses will called and by whom ??
      - General principle is that given our adversarial system, it is the parties to the litigation who decide what witnesses are to be called and in what order.
        - This can have a major impact on how a witness may be questioned.
        - Can give a huge tactical advantage to one party over another due to limits placed on the manner in which questions can be posed. 
      - The question in criminal matters is who is responsible for deciding who is to be called as a Crown witness ??
        - Need to be aware of duties and role of Prosecutor. See Prosecutor’s Duties as set out in Rule 29 Legal Profession Uniform Law Australian Solicitors’ Conduct Rules 2015 [NSW] https://legislation.nsw.gov.au/view/html/inforce/current/sl-2015-0244#sec.29	
          - Must call evidence that may assist court, even if not helpful to case
          - Must be fair case/trial
          - Must assist court
          - Must not press the prosecution’s case for a conviction beyond a full and firm presentation of that case
    - R v Apostilides (1984) 154 CLR 563 
      - Apostilides was tried and convicted on four counts of rape. 
        - At trial P failed to call 2 witness – these witnesses were called by D and cross examined by P (NOT FAVORABLE AT ALL - CAN’T CROSS). 
        - Apostilides appealed on basis that the P should have called the witnesses so D could cross examine them (argued miscarriage of justice). 
        - Appeal upheld by VSC – retrial ordered (Crown then appealed the VSC decision in HCA)
      - As part Special Leave Application, HCA set out various propositions including:
        - The Prosecutor alone bears the responsibility of deciding whether a person will be called as a witness for the Crown. 
        - A decision of the Prosecutor not to call a particular person as a witness will only constitute a ground for setting aside a conviction if, when viewed against the conduct of the trial taken as a whole, it is seen to give rise to a miscarriage of justice.
    - R v Kneebone (1999) 47 NSWLR 450
      - Another case where the Crown failed to call a Witness is the case of Kneebone.
      - Kneebone is authority for the principle that the Crown must meet the obligations that were identified in Apostilides because the Prosecutor is obliged to present the case fairly. This is an important part of the Duties of the Prosecutor.
      - Case identifies that although we have an adversarial system of justice, the Prosecutor continues to have an obligation to ensure that a prosecution proceeds fairly. 
        - Question of fairness and balance on part of Prosecutor – See also Whitehorn v The Queen (1983) 152 CLR 657 (Deane, J. at 663-664)
      - Crown Prosecutor bears responsibility for deciding whether to call a witness for the Crown.
      - Judge may, but not obliged to question Crown regarding reasons not to call a witness. Not called to adjudicate sufficiency of those reasons.
      - At the close of the Crown case, Judge may ask Crown to reconsider the decision, but cannot compel the Crown to call a witness.
      - Judge may comment to jury about failure of Crown to call a witness and the effect on the trial (but also now see Dyers v The Queen).
      - Save for exceptional circumstances, judge should not call a witness.
      - Decision not to call a witness is only a ground to set aside a conviction if, when viewed against conduct of whole trial, it gives rise to a miscarriage of justice.
  - Can the Judge Call a Witness?
    - The issue of whether a Judge can a call a witness was examined in Apostilides where one of the propositions identified by the HCA was that only in extraordinary circumstances should the Judge call a witness on his / her own volition.
      - In an adversarial system of litigation, the dispute is supposed to be run by the disputing parties; the judge is not supposed to intervene in the conduct of their cases. However, if the Judge feels that there may be a miscarriage of justice, the Judge is permitted to call a witness (only in extraordinary circumstances). 
    - The authority for the kind of extraordinary circumstances contemplated by the HCA comes from the decision in R v Damic [1982] 2 NSWLR 750. 
    - R v Damic [1982] 2 NSWLR 750
      - Damic was a self-represented litigant who had been charged with many offences, including murder. 
      - Trial Judge thought Damic was fundamentally incapable of leading a proper defence (serious mental illness). Damic refused to raise mental illness as his defence – Judge considered that this did not accord to the principles of a fair trial. 
      - Trial Judge called a psychiatrist to assess the fitness of Damic to represent himself, and the psychiatrist was then called as a witness to testify about the Damic’s fitness. Had the judge not called that witness, and had Damic been convicted, the conviction would have been unfair and vulnerable to being overturned on appeal.
  - Failure to Call a Witness
    - How does the law address the fact that a party fails to call evidence (witness) that the party would reasonably be expected to ?
      - The rule in Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298 relates to civil cases where the Plaintiff does not call a witness that they would reasonably be expected to have called – as a result the Trial Judge may draw an adverse inference from that failure. (Note that s 20 EA only applies to criminal matters)
      - The principle in Jones v Dunkel was originally extended to apply in criminal cases – this position is no longer valid in criminal matters. 
      - The application of Jones v Dunkel in criminal matters has been repeatedly overruled, most conclusively in the HCA decision in Dyers.
    - Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298 (CIVIL)
      - Although Jones v Dunkel was a civil matter in relation to a fatal road accident where the driver of the defendant’s truck was not called to give evidence and does not directly deal with the issue of the accused’s right to silence at trial, per se, the HCA decision in this matter has been cited as an authority for the proposition that in certain circumstances an inference can be drawn from a party’s failure to give or call evidence.
      - The Jones v Dunkel principle says that if a party would normally be expected to call a witness, or adduce other evidence, and they choose not to call that witness / adduce that evidence, in the absence of an explanation for failure to call the witness, a court might be entitled to conclude / infer that the evidence of that witness would not have assisted the party.
      - In light of the wording of s 20 and a several HCA decisions such as Dyers v The Queen, Jones v Dunkel does not have any real application in criminal matters.
  - Failure to Call Evidence
    - How does the law address the fact that the Defence fails to call evidence (witness) that the Defence would reasonably be expected to have called ?
      - Following the HCA decision in Dyers v The Queen, no comment should be made about the failure of the Defence to call a witness who might have been able to assist the Defence case.
      - Only comment that can be made is that the jury should not speculate about what the witness might have said, if he / she had been called (Dyers v The Queen [15] refers)
    - A similar approach is taken with respect to the Accused making the election not to give evidence on his / her own behalf.
    - How does the law address the fact that the Crown fails to call evidence that the Crown would reasonably be expected to have called ?
      - Following decisions such as RPS v The Queen [2000] HCA 3, Dyers v The Queen [2002] HCA 45, Mahmood v WA (2008) 232 CLR 397 and R v Louizos [2009] NSWCCA 71 the position is that where the P has failed to call a witness (who might have been expected to be called by the P), the jury may properly reach conclusions that the failure may help support a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused.
      - As per Criminal Trial Courts Bench Book (NSW)
        - … a jury is entitled to take into account that there was no evidence from a particular person in deciding whether or not there is a reasonable doubt about the accused’s guilt.
    - How does the law address the fact that the Crown fails to call evidence that the Crown would reasonably be expected to have called ?
      - Mahmood v WA (2008) 232 CLR 397, is authority for the proposition that “… where a witness, who might have been expected to be called and to give evidence on a matter, is not called by the prosecution, the question is not whether the jury may properly reach conclusions about issues of fact but whether, in the circumstances, they should entertain a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused.”
      - In R v Louizos [2009] NSWCCA 71 it was held that “… it may have been appropriate for the Trial Judge to raise with the jury whether the failure of the Crown to call the witness gave rise to a reasonable doubt about the truthfulness and reliability of the evidence… but he was never asked to do so.” [57]
## Lecture 3B: Right to Silence

  - The Menu
    - The Right to Silence
    - Silence of the Accused Pre-Trial
    - Silence of the Accused at Trial
  - The Right to Silence
    - Right to Silence is a legal protection given to people undergoing police interrogation or at Trial.
    - Right is linked with principles that Prosecution bears Burden of Proof and that the Accused is not a compellable witness in his / her own Trial.
    - Right covers a number of issues centered around the right to refuse to answer questions – usually relates to avoidance of self-incrimination.
    - Right usually includes the provision that adverse comments or inferences cannot be made by the Judge or Jury about the refusal to answer questions before or during a Trial.
    - Right extends from the moment of arrest to the end of the Trial.
    - Different rules apply in relation to Pre-Trial Silence and Silence at Trial 
  - Pre-Trial Silence
    - Evidence of Silence (s 89 & s 89A)
      - In a Criminal proceeding, s 89 provides that subject to the special requirements set out in s 89A, an unfavourable inference must not be drawn from evidence that a person failed or refused:
        - to answer one or more questions, or
        - to respond to a representation,
      - put to that person by an investigating official, who at that time, was performing functions in connection with the investigation of the commission, or possible commission, of an offence (s 89(1) refers). 
      - For a serious indictable offence, s 89A provides unfavourable inferences may be drawn if A failed / refused to mention a fact that A could reasonably have been expected to mention in the circumstances existing at the time, and that is relied on in his / her defence in that proceeding (s 89A(1) refers).
        - AKA TELL THEM YOUR ALIBI
      - Certain requirements such as a ‘Special Caution’ apply in relation to s 89A. 
  - Silence at Trial
    - How does the law address the situation where the Accused elects to remain silent at trial ?
      - The Accused has the right to remain silent at trial and put the Prosecution to proof. Consequently he / she may elect not to give evidence or not call evidence on his / her behalf.
      - As set out in s 20 EA, the Prosecution is not permitted to make comment about the Accused’s election not to give evidence. (Raises questions about what ‘comment’ actually means ????)
      - Under s 20(2) the Judge, or other party (not Prosecution), may comment on the Accused’s election but must not make a comment that suggests / infers that the Defendant is guilty of the offence. cf Weissensteiner v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 217
      - This section only applies in criminal proceeding for an indictable offence. 
    - Evidence Act s 20 - Comment on failure to give evidence
      - (1) This section applies only in a criminal proceeding for an indictable offence. 
      - (2) The Judge or any party (other than the Prosecutor) may comment on a failure of the Defendant to give evidence. However, unless the comment is made by another Defendant in the proceeding, the comment must not suggest that the Defendant failed to give evidence because the defendant was, or believed that he or she was, guilty of the offence concerned. 
      - (3) ……..
    - Weissensteiner v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 217
      - Facts: W went on a boat trip with a young couple. Sometime during the trip, the couple dropped out of contact with everyone they knew and stopped drawing upon their bank account. W returned alone, with the boat, and with some of their possessions. When questioned about their whereabouts, he gave conflicting explanations. He was charged with their murder and tried. At his trial, he did not give evidence. The TJ told the jury that, since W was the only person in the world in a position to contradict or deny the Crown case (that he murdered them), and he elected not to do so, the jury could more safely draw an inference of guilt from his decision not to testify.
        - HCA: Held that this was a permissible comment to make.
      - The HCA decision in Weissensteiner is at odds with the basis for s 20 – the practical protection the Accused’s right to silence. 
      - *** Weissensteiner reflected a principle that originated in civil case of Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298.
    - The enactment of the EA has clarified the limitations on judicial comments about the Accused’s decision not to testify. 
      - When examining s 20, the superior courts have said that comments about adverse inferences should be seen as an interference with the right to silence, which is an entrenched and fundamental right.
      - In light of HCA decisions in RPS, Azzopardi and Dyers, it is clear that only in a rare and exceptional case, where the facts would be peculiarly within the knowledge of the Defendant, will the Judge be permitted to make an adverse comment about the Defendant’s failure to give evidence. This is how the HCA reconciled and rehabilitated its decision in Weissensteiner v R (1993) 178 CLR 217.
    - RPS v The Queen (2000) 199 CLR 620
      - Facts: RPS was on trial for sexual assaults against his daughter between the ages of 4 and 14. 
        - The evidence against him came from his daughter (complainant) and her mother, to whom RPS had apparently made certain admissions about the sexual assaults. 
        - RPS elected not to give evidence, which means in effect that he did not deny the evidence against him.
      - HCA: Held that Weissensteiner, and all the cases that relied on it, were no longer applicable. 
        - HCA said that, in a criminal trial, the entire onus is upon the Prosecution, and it will never – or rarely – be reasonable to expect the accused to testify. 
        - HCA also held that s 20 prohibits the TJ from commenting in any way that suggests the accused is guilty of the offence.
      - *** The following year, in Azzopardi v The Queen (2001) 205 CLR 50, the HCA affirmed this decision.
    - Dyers v The Queen (2002) 210 CLR 285
      - Facts: Dyers was the leader of what the HCA later described as a “cult” called Kenja. 
        - A 13-year-old girl was the daughter of a Kenja member, and the girl attended what was called a “processing session” with Dyers during which she alleges he sexually assaulted her. 
        - In his defence, Dyers said he had an alibi. At the time the girl alleges he sexually assaulted her, he said he had an appointment for an “energy conversion” session with a woman called Wendy. 
        - He tendered his appointment diary to show that he had an appointment with Wendy at the time. He did not call Wendy.
      - TJ said to the jury: “you are not entitled to speculate on what the witness might have said if the witness had been called”.
        - Also said that they were “entitled to draw the inference that the evidence of that witness would not have assisted the party who you have assessed should have called that witness”.
        - Went on to say, “you do not have to draw the inference that I have suggested”. 
        - TJ emphasised that “it is for the Crown to prove [the charge] and to do so beyond reasonable doubt. 
        - And that there is no onus on the accused to prove anything”.
      - The NSWCCA thought that there was nothing wrong with the TJ’s comments, and that it would have been “abundantly clear” to the jury that Dyers did not have to discharge any onus.
      - HCA: Majority held that the TJ’s directions contravened s 20 - quashing the conviction and ordering a re-trial. 
        - Majority stressed that nothing must interfere with the Accused person’s right to silence, nor with the presumption of innocence. 
        - Unanimously agreed that the accused does not need to give or call any evidence.
    - If the Accused does not give evidence at Trial, these directions should be given:
      - 1. The silence of the Accused is not evidence against the Accused (Azzopardi (2001) 205 CLR 50 [51]),
      - 2. The silence of the Accused cannot be treated as an admission of guilt (OGD (1997) 45 NSWLR 744, R v Baker [2001] NSWCCA 151, Azzopardi (2001) 205 CLR 50),
      - 3. The silence of the Accused cannot be used to fill gaps in the prosecution case (Azzopardi (2001) 205 CLR 50), and 
      - 4. The silence of the Accused cannot be used as a make-weight in assessing whether the Crown has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt (Azzopardi (2001) 205 CLR 50)
## Week 4: Relevance

- Relevance
  - Admissibility – A 3 Stage Process
    - In assessing the admissibility of evidence the Court undertakes a three stage process where each threshold must be met before moving to the next step:
      - 1. Relevant / Not Relevant ?
      - 2. If Relevant, are there any Exclusionary Rule that apply ?
      - 3. If no Exclusionary Rule applies, should the Trial Judge use Discretion to exclude the evidence ?
  - Common Terms
    - “Fact in issue def” the principle facts to be proven by the party bearing the burden of proof on a particular issue – facts that need to be proven to win your case
    - “Probative value def” means the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue – how important is that evidence when trying to prove that fact ?
- The Concept of Relevance
  - Relevance
    - Relevance is the cornerstone of the Rules of Evidence.
    - In terms of Evidence, the concept of Relevance is widely defined and can appear to be rather subjective. (R v Le)
    - The general rule is that the evidence must have some bearing on a fact in issue.
    - Relevance does not equate to reliability or credibility – plays no part in testing relevance – test assumes the evidence is reliable (Papakosmas v The Queen)
    - Main EA provisions that deal with Relevance are s 55 & s 56. See also s 57 (Provisional Relevance) & s 58 (Inference as to Relevance – relates to relevance of documents etc).
  - EVIDENCE ACT 1995 - SECT 55 
    - Relevant Evidence
      - (1) The evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is evidence that, if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding.
      - (2) In particular, evidence is not taken to be irrelevant only because it relates only to:
        - (a) the credibility of a witness, or
        - (b) the admissibility of other evidence, or
        - (c) a failure to adduce evidence.
    - Relevant evidence to be admissible
      - (1) Except as otherwise provided by this Act, evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is admissible in the proceeding.
      - (2) Evidence that is not relevant in the proceeding is not admissible.
  - Relevance
    - The key concept that underpins s.55 is that there needs to be a logical or rational connection between the evidence and the facts to be proven.
    - Definition requires the minimal logical connection between the evidence and the facts in issue.
    - Court looks at the affect that the evidence could have, if it were accepted.
    - Words like “rational” under the Act, do not necessarily mean what we presume them to mean. 
      - What is logical or rational to lawyers and judges may bear little relationship to what is logical or rational to lay people
    - Whether logical or rational connection exists is an objective test grounded in human experience. (per Lindgren J Harrington-Smith v WA [2003] FCA 893)
    - Indirect connection is sufficient (e.g. Defendant expressed intention to kill victim – sufficient to help the trier of fact better assess whether a fact in issue (intention) is present.
    - Does not need to make a fact ‘probable’, just needs to make it more or less probable than it would be without the evidence (probative value).
      - – If no impact on probability, material not relevant
      - – not a stringent or narrow test
      - – only need minimal probative value to satisfy the s 55 test.
  - Relevance & Use
    - In litigation, the ‘evidence’ may be relevant in several ways.
      - For example: D told W he robbed a bank.
        - – It may be important to your case to show that D was involved in a conversation with W – therefore the conversation will be relevant to show that a conversation took place.
        - – It may also be important to show what was said in the conversation was actually true – the conversation will be relevant to prove D robbed the bank.
    - Important to be able to identify whether the evidence is Relevant, and if so, for what use / uses. 
      - *** One piece of evidence may be used in a number of ways.
        - – Although there may be a rule of evidence that prohibits one of these uses, the evidence may still be permitted for the other use.
    - This becomes especially important when dealing with Hearsay evidence
      - – eg. the Hearsay rule may be used to exclude the evidence that proves the truth about what was said, but that same conversation may be admissible for the purpose of showing that something was said.
  - Papakosmas v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 297
    - Facts: A was convicted of sexually assaulting a colleague at an office Christmas party. 
      - The complainant alleged that A forced her to have sexual intercourse in a little room away from the party. The issue at trial was consent.
    - The complainant and three other witnesses gave evidence at trial of her immediate complaints.
    - According to that evidence, when the complainant returned to the party she saw a colleague. The complainant was crying. 
      - The colleague asked her what was wrong, and the complainant said that A had raped her.
    - The colleague took the complainant outside to a table where she repeated to complaint to another woman. 
      - She was crying and holding her head in her hands and appeared distressed. 
      - Shortly afterwards, the complainant repeated her complaint to a third woman. 
      - The third woman gave evidence that the complainant was crying uncontrollably and appeared extremely distressed.
    - Issue – Was the evidence given of the complaint relevant ? If so, for what purpose(s) ??
      - 1. It was relevant to proving the facts asserted by the complainant (that she had not consented).
      - 2. It was relevant to supporting the credibility of the complainant.
  - Smith v The Queen (2001) 2016 CLR 650
    - Facts: Smith was indicted in relation to the robbery of two banks.
      - Appeal against conviction to NSWCCA dismissed.
    - The fact that the robbery took place was not in issue. Bank security cameras had taken photographs showing what happened. 
      - The Prosecution's case that Smith was the person who was shown in the photographs, standing near the back of the automatic teller machine, apparently keeping lookout while the co-offenders took the money.
    - Issue: The only question for determination by the jury was ‘Is Smith the person represented in the photograph?” 
      - The police knew Smith and identified him as the person in the photographs
    - Police not eyewitnesses. They were just looking at the photographs. So what made their act of looking relevant? The jurors could also look at the photographs and decide, by comparing the man in the photo with Smith.
    - The Crown argued that because the police already knew Smith, they were better placed than a juror, and that is what makes the police evidence relevant.
    - Defence argued that the police were in no better position than the jury in making a comparison between the defendant and the photograph.
  - Smith v The Queen (2001)
    - [11] Because the witness's assertion of identity was founded on material no different from the material available to the jury from its own observation, the witness's assertion that he recognised the appellant is not evidence that could rationally affect the assessment by the jury of the question we have identified. 
    - The fact that someone else has reached a conclusion about the identity of the accused and the person in the picture does not provide any logical basis for affecting the jury's assessment of the probability of the existence of that fact when the conclusion is based only on material that is not different in any substantial way from what is available to the jury.
    - HCA majority held that there was nothing about the police evidence that would rationally help a juror in making his / her own assessment of whether the person in the photograph, was the accused or not. 
    - The evidence given by police regarding the identity did not satisfy s 55 – therefore not relevant (and therefore not admissible – s 56). 
    - Kirby J (in dissent) held that the evidence given by the police was indirectly relevant as police had seen A in various guises and from various angles and were in a better position to assess if A was the person in photographs.
      - [45] As a matter of legal policy it is undesirable, and unnecessary in terms of rules of admissibility "otherwise provided by [the] Act", to set the hurdle of relevance too high. (per Kirby J)
  - Evans v The Queen [2007] HCA 59
    - Facts: Evans was on trial for armed robbery at the Strathfield Council Chambers. 
      - The robber was filmed on security cameras, and was wearing a balaclava, sunglasses and overalls, and said certain words during the robbery. 
      - During his trial, under cross-examination, the Prosecutor made Evans put on a balaclava, sunglasses and overalls, walk around in front of the jury, and say the words that the robber had said during the robbery.
    - Appealed all the way to HCA on several grounds – one of which was relevance. Was it relevant for the jury to see the defendant dressed up like that, walking around like that, and saying those words?
    - Gummow and Hayne JJ – said not relevant because it only enabled a comparison between the clothing and the security photographs - revealed nothing about the actual wearer.
      - Kirby J – said that the relevance threshold is broad and should not be used to artificially exclude evidence that is, in fact, problematic (and perhaps inadmissible for other reasons).
    - Heydon J (Crennan J agreeing) – said evidence was relevant but did not prove the whole case against Evans. 
    - Showing a resemblance would assist the juror. 
      - Also said that, if the evidence showed that Evans didn’t resemble the offender, it would certainly have been relevant for excluding the Evans as the offender.
  - Relevance Summary
    - What is the material (evidence) relevant to prove?
    - Does it meet the threshold test in s 55 – could it rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue ? If no, material cannot be admissible (s 56)
    - Not a high threshold – only minimal probative value needed to satisfy s 55.
    - Relevance does not look at issues of reliability or credibility – these issues are dealt with by other provisions.
    - Material may be relevant for more than one purpose.
## Week 5: Hearsay Exclusionary Rule

- Hearsay Exclusionary Rule
  - An introductory thought !!
    - The rule against hearsay has been described by text writers as one of the oldest, most complex, most confusing, most intellectually challenging of the exclusionary rules of evidence, absurdly technical, a conglomeration of inconsistencies, with an unclear definition, an unclear ambit, of bewildering breadth and conceptual complexity, resembling an old-fashioned crazy-quilt made of patches cut from a group of paintings by cubists, futurists and surrealists.
  - Debunking the myths about Hearsay 
    - Many of the problems associated with the use of Hearsay evidence have been done away with since the introduction of Evidence Act.
      - For many years there had been calls to rationalise the use of Hearsay evidence throughout the Common Law world – numerous studies undertaking including one conducted by ALRC (which lead to development of EA)
    - Main thing to remember when mastering Hearsay is to understand what it really means and why the Courts treat it with trepidation – this will help shape your thinking and hopefully minimise the confusion.
    - In its most simple form, Hearsay relates to information that was not seen / heard by the Witness that is giving the evidence – they have been told about what happened by another person.
      - eg .   Adam tells Belinda that he had bought a new laptop for his girlfriend, Clare, as a surprise for her birthday.
    - In this case the only person who really knows the truth of the statement is Adam (the maker of the representation).  Evidence from both Belinda and Claire would be considered Hearsay because they did not see Adam buy the laptop.
    - The reason why this presents a problem for the Court is that Hearsay evidence cannot be tested properly – the Court wants to deal with the best evidence available.
    - The Court does not want to deal with evidence that may have been corrupted or influenced as part of the story telling process – it is unfair !!
    - A good example of how the evidence can be corrupted / influenced as part of the story telling process is Chinese Whispers.
    - We need of way of dealing with this type of material to make sure that we do not encounter these types of issues.
    - Under EA, this is the Hearsay Rule and it forms part of the suite of Exclusionary Rules found in Chapter 3 of the Act.
  - The Hearsay Rule 
    - The Hearsay Rule is a rule that prevents the use of a previous representation to prove that was intentionally asserted in that representation is actually true.
    - It is important to understand that Hearsay is not a type of evidence.  It is a use of evidence.  Whether evidence of a previous representation is Hearsay depends on the purpose for which the evidence is being used.
      - eg.  A Hearsay purpose arises when someone relates what someone else said, not merely to show that it was said, but to prove a fact they asserted in that representation. See Subramaniam v Public Prosecutor [1956] 1 WLR 965
    - Subramaniam v Public Prosecutor [1956] 1 WLR 965
      - Subramaniam taken hostage by Chinese Communists during Malaya crisis.  Told by captors that if he talked he would be killed.  Tried to use this as defence of duress.  
        - Trial Judge held that the comments were hearsay and inadmissible.  
        - On appeal, Privy Council held that statement was admissible, but only to show that the statement was made – thereby being enough to scare Subramaniam into doing what he was told.
      - Evidence of a statement made to a witness . . . may or may not be hearsay. 
        - It is hearsay and inadmissible when the object [purpose] of the evidence is to establish the truth of what is contained in the statement.
        - It is not hearsay and is admissible when it is proposed to establish by the evidence, not the truth of the statement, but the fact that it was made. 
        - The fact that the statement was made, quite apart from its truth, is frequently relevant ...
    - The Hearsay Rule is set out in s59 EA and similar to the other Exclusionary rules in the Act, it provides a prohibition on the use of the material.
      - Several exceptions to the Hearsay Rule are provided for in Part 3.2 of the Act which details the various circumstances where the Court considers it ‘safe’ to use Hearsay evidence to prove the fact asserted.
      - To be able to properly utilise the Hearsay Rule and the Exceptions need to understand various terms such as: 
        - Representation
        - Previous Representation
        - Maker of Representation
        - Fact intended to be asserted
    - Representation
      - The EA does not define representation, but in the Dictionary of the Act states that representations include:
        - (a) an express or implied representation (whether oral or in writing – may also include silence or an action), or 
        - (b) a representation to be inferred from conduct, or 
        - (c) a representation not intended by its maker to be communicated to or seen by another person, or 
        - (d) a representation that for any reason is not communicated.
      - A representation is not confined to a matter which is relevant to the immediate facts in issue; it may include a matter which is relevant to understanding the facts in issue (R v Ambrosoli (2002) 55 NSWLR 603).  eg. motive rather than mens rea 
    - Previous Representation
      - Means a representation made otherwise than in the course of giving evidence in the proceeding in which evidence of the representation is sought to be adduced.
      - AKA Representation made out of court
    - Maker of Representation
      - The person who made previous representation.
      - AKA the person who claimed something - Adam from laptop
    - Fact Intended to be Asserted
      - What did the Maker of the Representation mean by his / her representation ?
      - Not concerned with the actual representation itself – concerned with the fact that the Maker of the Representation intended to assert.  eg.  Bob said the band he saw was ‘cool’ 
    - s59 The Hearsay Rule-Exclusion of Hearsay Evidence 
      - Evidence of a previous representation made by a person is not admissible to prove the existence of a fact that it can reasonably be supposed that the person intended to assert by the representation.
      - (2) Such a fact is in this Part referred to as an asserted fact.
      - (2A) For the purposes of determining under subsection (1) whether it can reasonably be supposed that the person intended to assert a particular fact by the representation, the Court may have regard to the circumstances in which the representation was made. 
      - (3) [.....]
      - Note : Subsection (2A) was inserted as a response to the decision of the Supreme Court of NSW in R v Hannes(2000) 158 FLR 359 .
    - Implied Assertions & Intention
      - Prior to the amendments to this provision, the Act made no strict reference to implied assertions so following comments by Spigelman CJ in R v Hannes, it was decided to give clearer definition to the term ‘intention’ hence the insertion of ‘reasonably be supposed that the person intended to assert ’ and ss2A.
      - This reinforces the position that under the EA only intended assertions (express or implied) will be subject to the Hearsay Rule (Common Law captured both intended and unintended representations)
        - See Walton v The Queen (1989) 166 CLR 283:  where child answered phone and said ‘Hello Daddy’.  Under Common Law this comment was captured by Hearsay Rule – under EA this comment would be considered to be unintentional and would not be subject to s59. 
      - So if the express or implied assertion is unintended then it is not caught by the Hearsay Rule.
    - Process so far 
      - Step 1 is to identify the ‘previous representation’ 
      - Step 2 is to work out who made the representation. (this becomes important when working out what exceptions to the Hearsay Rule may / may not apply).
      - Step 3 is to derive the intention of the Maker in making the representation.  If made unintentionally, it will not be captured by s59.
      - Step 4 is to identify the purpose of the evidence.  Is it being adduced to prove the existence of an asserted fact? (Yes = hearsay - s59 applies; No = not hearsay - s59 does not apply).
  - First-Hand and More Remote Hearsay
    - Overarching aim of EA is to let in as much relevant evidence as possible whilst still ensuring that the evidence is reliable and fair.
    - Over the years, some types of ‘problematic’ evidence have been assessed as being potentially reliable if certain criteria are met, or the evidence is handled in a particular manner.
    - This point is true in relation to some forms of Hearsay evidence.  In certain circumstances it may be possible to apply one of the various exceptions to the Hearsay Rule – because they are potentially reliable. 
    - Main exceptions to the Hearsay rule fall into two categories - ‘First-Hand Hearsay Exceptions’ or ‘More Remote Hearsay Exceptions’.
    - Essentially, First-Hand Hearsay is where the previous representation (containing an asserted fact) was made by the Maker in the presence of the person who gives evidence about it (Witness).  See s62
      - There is only one degree of separation between the Maker of the Previous Representation and the Witness relating that asserted fact.
    - If there is a greater degree of separation between the Maker of the Previous Representation and the person giving the evidence (Witness), that is referred to as ‘More Remote Hearsay’.
    - The degree of remoteness becomes important when applying the exceptions under Part 3.2
    - Under s62, there is a requirement that it must be reasonably supposed that the Maker of the Previous Representation has personal knowledge of the asserted fact because of what he / she has seen, heard or otherwise perceived and makes a representation about that fact to the Witness.
  - Examples
    - Molly says to Wendy that she saw the man with the gun.
      - Wendy’s evidence would be considered First-Hand Hearsay about Molly having seen the man with the gun because it has come directly from the Maker of the previous representation (Molly) who has personal knowledge of the asserted fact.
    - Molly says to Wendy that she saw the man with gun.  Wendy then tells Richard about what Molly told her.
      - The giving of this evidence by Richard would be considered More Remote Hearsay because the asserted fact has not come directly from the Maker (Molly) who has personal knowledge of what happened.
## Week 6: Hearsay Evidence

- Hearsay Evidence
  - Hearsay Revision
    - The Hearsay Rule is set out in s59 EA and similar to the other Exclusionary rules in the Act, it provides a prohibition on the use of the material.
    - Several exceptions to the Hearsay Rule are provided for in Part 3.2 of the Act which details the various circumstances where the Court considers it ‘safe’ to use Hearsay evidence to prove the fact asserted.
    - To be able to properly utilise the Hearsay Rule and the Exceptions need to understand various terms such as: 
      - Previous Representation
      - Maker of Representation
      - Fact intended to be asserted
      - First-hand Hearsay v More Remote Hearsay
  - First Hand and More Remote Hearsay
    - Essentially, First Hand Hearsay is where the previous representation (containing an asserted fact) was made by the Maker in the presence of the person who gives evidence about it (Witness).  See s62
      - There is only one degree of separation between the Maker of the representation and the Witness relating that asserted fact.
    - If there is a greater degree of separation between the Maker of the previous representation and the person giving the evidence (Witness), that is referred to as ‘More Remote Hearsay’.
    - The degree of remoteness becomes important when applying the exceptions under Part 3.2
    - Under s62, there is a requirement that it must be reasonably supposed that the Maker of the previous representation has personal knowledge of the asserted fact because of what he / she has seen, heard or otherwise perceived and makes a representation about that fact to the Witness.
- Exceptions to Hearsay Rule 
  - Exceptions to Hearsay Rule
    - Specific exceptions to the Hearsay Rule include: 
      - First-hand hearsay:

        - Civil proceedings, if maker of representation is available (s64) 
        - Criminal proceedings, if maker of representation is not available (s65) 
        - Criminal proceedings, if maker of representation is available (s66)
    - Contemporaneous statements about a person’s health etc (s66A)
    - Business records (s69)
    - ATSI  traditional laws and customs (s72)
    - Use of evidence in Interlocutory proceedings (s75) 
*** Evidence relevant for a non-hearsay purpose (s60)
*** Admissions (s81)
*** Character Evidence (s110)
  - Overview of First Hand Hearsay Exceptions
    - 
  - Maker Availability
    - Dictionary, cl.4 Unavailability of persons 
      - (1) For the purposes of this Act, a person is taken not to be available to give evidence about a fact if: 
        - (a) the person is dead, or 
        - (b) the person is, for any reason other than the application of section 16 (Competence and compellability: judges and jurors), not competent to give the evidence about the fact, or 
        - (c) it would be unlawful for the person to give evidence about the fact, or 
        - (d) a provision of this Act prohibits the evidence being given, or 
        - (e) all reasonable steps have been taken, by the party seeking to prove the person is not available, to find the person or to secure his or her attendance, but without success, or 
        - (f) all reasonable steps have been taken, by the party seeking to prove the person is not available, to compel the person to give the evidence, but without success. 
      - (2) In all other cases the person is taken to be available to give evidence about the fact. 
  - s63 Exception to Hearsay Rule
    - s63 Civil proceedings, if maker of representation is not available
      - (1) This section applies in a civil proceeding if a person who made a previous representation is not available to give evidence about an asserted fact.
    - (2) The hearsay rule does not apply to:
      - (a) evidence of the representation that is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, or
      - (b) a document so far as it contains the representation, or another representation to which it is reasonably necessary to refer in order to understand the representation.
    - Note:  Section 67 imposes notice requirements relating to this subsection. 
    - s63 provides the lowest threshold for the admissibility of Hearsay Evidence.
    - Merely requires that the Witness saw, heard or perceived the representation being made by the Maker.
    - If a party intends to call such evidence to be used for its Hearsay purpose (ie. to prove the asserted fact in the previous representation), that party must conform and provide a Notice to the other party pursuant to s67 EA.
    - 
  - s 64 Exception to Hearsay Rule
    - s64 Civil proceedings, if maker of representation is available
      - (2) The hearsay rule does not apply to:
        - (a) evidence of the representation that is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, or
        - (b) a document so far as it contains the representation, or another representation to which it is reasonably necessary to refer in order to understand the representation, 
        - if it would cause undue expense or undue delay, or would not be reasonably practicable, to call the person who made the representation to give evidence.
      - Note. Section 67 imposes notice requirements relating to this subsection. Section 68 is about objections to notices that relate to this subsection.
      - (3) If the person who made the representation has been or is to be called to give evidence, the hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of the representation that is given by:
        - (a) that person, or
        - (b) a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made.
      - [section continues…]
    - The effect of s64 is that it provides the party calling the Hearsay evidence a wide degree of flexibility.
    - s64(2) enables a party to adduce the Hearsay evidence through a Witness if it would cause undue delay or expense, or would be not be reasonably practicable to call the Maker of the previous representation.
      - This is very broadly defined and applied and takes into account cost of securing Maker, length of trial, health and location of maker.
      - *Requires reasonable written notice of intention to call such evidence (s67).
    - s64(3) provides that if the Maker is called to give evidence, either:
      - The Maker of the previous representation; or
      - A person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the previous representation 
    - can give evidence of the asserted fact.
  - s65 Exception to Hearsay Rule
    - s65 Criminal proceedings, if maker of representation is not available
      - (2) The Hearsay Rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, if the representation:
        - (a) was made under a duty to make that representation or to make representations of that kind, or
        - (b) was made when or shortly after the asserted fact occurred and in circumstances that make it unlikely that the representation is a fabrication, or
        - (c) was made in circumstances that make it highly probable that the representation is reliable, or
        - (d) was:
          - (i) against the interests of the person who made it at the time it was made; and
          - (ii) made in circumstances that make it likely that the representation is reliable.
        - Note. s67 imposes notice requirements relating to this subsection.
    - s65(2) imposes more demanding requirements on the Prosecution.
      - This is because the evidence will be used against a Defendant who is presumed to be innocent, so there should be greater safeguards in relation to potentially unreliable evidence (not just warning or a discretionary exclusion).  
    - For the Prosecution, it is not enough that the unavailable maker of the representation had personal knowledge of the asserted fact, and that evidence of the representation will be given by a person who saw, heard or perceived the representation being made – the representation must have been made either:
      - A. Under a duty
      - B. Shortly after asserted fact occurred (reduces chance of fabrication)
      - C. In circumstances highly probable to be reliable (Conway v The Queen)
      - D. Against the interests of the maker.
    - (3) The Hearsay Rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation made in the course of giving evidence in an Australian or overseas proceeding if, in that proceeding, the Defendant in the proceeding to which this section is being applied:
      - A. cross-examined the person who made the representation about it, or
      - B. had a reasonable opportunity to cross-examine the person who made the representation about it.
    - (4) [.... Relates to Co-Accused]
    - (5) For the purposes of ss(3) and (4), a Defendant is taken to have had a reasonable opportunity to cross-examine a person if the Defendant was not present at a time when the cross-examination of a person might have been conducted but:	(a) could reasonably have been present at that time, and (b) if present could have cross-examined the person.
    - (6) Evidence of the making of a representation to which ss(3) applies may be adduced by producing a transcript, or a recording, of the representation that is authenticated by: (a) the person to whom, or the court or other body to which, the representation was made, or (b) if applicable, the registrar or other proper officer of the court or other body to which the representation was made, or (c) the person or body responsible for producing the transcript or recording. 
    - Under ss65(3) – 65(6)  Statements made in previous court proceedings may be adduced for their Hearsay purpose as long as the Defendant had opportunity to cross-examine in those earlier proceedings.  eg. evidence in committal proceedings being used again at trial. 
    - Puchalski v R held that what is required is that Defendant cross-examined the person in the earlier proceeding or had a reasonable opportunity to do so – the exception does not rely on nature and extent of cross-examination.
    - (8) The Hearsay Rule does not apply to:
      - (a) evidence of a previous representation adduced by a Defendant if the evidence is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, or
      - (b) a document tendered as evidence by a Defendant so far as it contains a previous representation, or another representation to which it is reasonably necessary to refer in order to understand the representation.
    - Note. s67 imposes notice requirements relating to this subsection.
    - (9) If evidence of a previous representation about a matter has been adduced by a Defendant and has been admitted, the hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of another representation about the matter that:
      - (a) is adduced by another party, and 
      - (b) is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the other representation being made. 
    - s65(8) imposes are far less demanding threshold for the admission of the asserted fact for its Hearsay purpose, if adduced by the Defendant.  
      - Essentially, this is the same level required under s63 (Civil – Maker not available:  person who heard / saw/ perceived previous representation can give evidence of the asserted fact.)
      - This is because of the notions of fairness to the Defendant. 
    - s65(8) is designed to promote the admission of exonerating statements of the alleged victim, confessions of 3rd parties and statements of deceased persons.
    - s65(9) provides the Prosecution the ability to ‘reply’ to any material adduced by the Defendant under s65(8), by adducing its own Hearsay evidence that qualifies or explains the Defendant’s s65(8) evidence.
  - s 66 Exception to Hearsay Rule
    - s66 Criminal proceedings, if maker of representation is available
      - (2) If that person (Maker) has been or is to be called to give evidence, the Hearsay Rule does not apply to evidence of the representation that is given by:
        - (a) that person, or
        - (b) a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made,
      - if, when the representation was made, the occurrence of the asserted fact was fresh in the memory of the person who made the representation.
      - (2A) In determining whether the occurrence of the asserted fact was fresh in the memory of a person, the Court may take into account all matters that it considers are relevant to the question, including:
        - (a) the nature of the event concerned, and
        - (b) the age and health of the person, and
        - (c) the period of time between the occurrence of the asserted fact and the making of the representation.
      - Note. Subsection (2A) was inserted as a response to the decision of the High Court of Australia in Graham v The Queen (1998) 195 CLR 606.
      - [section continues…]
    - s66 provides that in criminal proceedings where the Maker of the previous representation is available and the previous representation is to be used to prove the asserted fact (ie. for its Hearsay purpose) the Maker of the representation must be called to give evidence.  
    - As well as limiting the ambit of the exception , s66 imposes an additional limitation:
      - the requirement that the occurrence of the asserted fact be “fresh in the memory” of the Maker of the previous representation - “freshness” is only required in criminal matters.
    - The “fresh in the memory” requirement in s66(2) has long been the subject of judicial consideration.
    - In the HCA judgment in Graham v The Queen (1998) 195 CLR 606, the majority held that the term “fresh” meant “recent” or “immediate”  - thereby requiring the statement to be made very soon after the event in question.
      - “the temporal relationship” required will very likely be measured in hours or days, not, as was the case here (Graham’s case), in years.
    - This strict temporal requirement held in Graham’s case was considered too limiting and was amended by the insertion of s66(2A).
    - s66(2A) provides guidance to the Court when determining whether something is  “fresh in the memory”.  Court may now take into account such things as 
      - The nature of the event concerned; and 
      - The age and health of the person; and
      - The period of time between the occurrence of the asserted fact and the representation.
    - As held in Regina v XY [2010] NSWCCA 181 the temporal relationship between the asserted fact and the making of the representation remains relevant but is in no way determinative of the question. Importantly the court must now take into account the nature of the event concerned.
    - s66(3) provides that the s66(2) Hearsay exception does not apply to evidence of the previous representation that is adduced by the Prosecution, which:
      - a.   was made for the purpose of indicating what evidence 	that person would be able to give (called a proof of 	evidence); and 
      - b.  deals with matters other than the identity of a person, 	place or thing.
  - Graham v The Queen (1998) 195 CLR 606
    - Graham was a case where the complainant was raped by her father. 
      - It was 6 years before she told somebody about it, and it was this 6 year delay which the HCA said made her complaint lose its “freshness”. 
    - You might think that being raped by your father would be very memorable, and would remain memorable for more than a few hours or days, and that 6 years later you could probably still have a clear memory of it. 
    - Nevertheless, the HCA did not think so, and this is why there has been an amendment to s66, directly as a result of the decision in Graham.
  - 66A Exception: contemporaneous statements about a person’s health etc
    - s66A provides that the Hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation made by a person if the representation was a contemporaneous representation about the person’s health, feelings, sensations, intention, knowledge or state of mind.
    - This means that a person’s physical, mental state or intentions, etc can be inferred by what they say.
      - eg.  The fact that the Sue says to William “I have really bad a headache at the moment” can be adduced by William to prove that fact that Sue did have a headache at that time.
  - Some Other Hearsay Exceptions
    - Essentially, under s69 the Hearsay Rule does not apply to business documents, so that the documents can be used to prove the facts about the business and what is contained in the business document. 
      - s69 operates together with the rules about proving the contents of documents from ss48-50. 
    - Both ‘business’ and ‘document’ are very broadly defined, and the rationale here is to save time. It is presumed that business records accurately record the business. If they do not, a party would need to call evidence to prove that.
    - s70 is a similar exception to s69, and it applies to tags and labels. eg.  it can be presumed that a letter was in fact posted in Wagga on the 8th of June if that is what the postmark says.
    - s71 says that with electronic communications, information about who it came from, who it was sent to, the time and date, will not be caught by the hearsay rule.
    - s72 provides that the hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a representation about the existence or non-existence, or the content, of the traditional laws and customs of an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander group.
    - s75 says that the hearsay rule does not apply in Interlocutory Proceedings if the source of the evidence is adduced.
