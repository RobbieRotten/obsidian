      - members of the deceased’s family submit VIS providing details of impact loss or damage caused
        - Used to assist the court in determining sentence.
  - Three issues for Public in trial
    - the  contentious nature of the VISs
    - lack of notice and preparation for the objections 
    -  treatment of the family victims in the process.
  - Dawlan 
    - Making rulings with respect to each part of the statements subject to objection not necessary
  - Weird trial practices
    - Typically ask judges to disregard instead of object, but not the case here
      - Also warn barrister beforehand so they know (very casual)
        - Didn’t happen
      - Actually live edited the VIS without family input,
        - Took so long court adjourned
        - No justification to what was cut out
      - Separated defendant and victim families
    - Courts fixed these issues in May 2011 in ‘practice direction’

        - Request a preliminary hearing

      - Stuck men did eat whetmore (asking questions)
      - He proposed eating someone and dice

    - Society has law that take life willingly is hanged, but sympathy is allowed

    - Should the men who killed Roger Whetmore hang as law dictates even through a survival situation
    - N. C.  S. A. ( N. S. ) § 12-A, willfully take the life of Roger Whetmore.
      - "Whoever  shall  willfully  take  the  life  of  another  shall  be punished by death."

    - Truepenny C.J
      - Withheld 
    - Foster J
      - The  proposition  that  all  positive  law  is  based  on  the possibility of men's  coexistence
      - When the assumption that men may live together loses its  truth,  as  it  obviously  did  in  this  extraordinary situation where life only  became  possible  by  the  taking  of  life,  then  the basic premises underlying our whole legal order have lost their meaning and force.

      - Murder is done willfully, while self-defense is instinctual
      - Court has held that stealing bread due to hunger is not a valid defense

      - Did he revoke his offer prior to action taken
      - 90% of public and 90% of judges want to pardon or token punish, so that’s what it should be
        - With reason as public is crazy
