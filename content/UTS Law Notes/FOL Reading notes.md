  - Note the name of the case and its citation (Jurisdiction - is it binding or persuasive?)
  - Clarify the procedural history of the case. 
  - What the original dispute was
  - Current reason for trial
  - Ascertain the material facts
  - State the issue raised by the material facts 
    - Law(s)/Statue(s) in contention
    - Precedences
    - Tests
    - Words and Phrases Considered
    - Arguments made by each side
      - Plaintiff/Prosecution
      - Defense 
  - What each judge thought
  - Obiter 
  - Identify the legal reasoning and the ratio of the case.
  - Result

- Example
  - Note the name of the case and its citation
    - Clark v Malpas (1862) 31 Beav 80; 54 ER 1067
  - Clarify the procedural history of the case. 
    - No procedural history
  - Ascertain the material facts
    - In Clark v Malpas,the material facts relate to
      - the vendor's personal circumstances (old,seriously ill, illiterate),
      - the value of the property(aboutÂ£380), the price actually paid
      - 100 to heir plus 12s (shillings) per week and free rent for life)
      - and the circumstances in which the transaction occurred 
        - (the purchaser knew that the vendor was ill, the vendor had no independent advice, the transaction was completed very quickly and the vendor died soon afterward
  - State the issue raised by the material facts and how the court answered it (the result of the case)
    - In Clark v Malpas, the facts raised this issue: 
      - is it fair for a party to retain the benefit of a bargain where the contract is hastily executed and the other party is a sick old man who received no independent advice and inadequate consideration? 
        - And the court's answer? No
  - Identify the reasoning which supported the decision and the ratio of the case.
    - In this case it’s facts, so not much ratio (mostly appellate has ratio)
    - Defendant used precedent that was distinguished by judge due to material difference
      - Previous case gave seller time to move deliberately into transaction
    - Example ratio: where the sale of property is for a very inadequate consideration and the circumstances establish that the vendor requires the protection of the law, 
      - the burden is on the purchaser to prove that the transaction was entered into carefully, deliberately and with full knowledge

- autochthonous expedient’
  - state courts could be invested with federal jurisdiction.
  - Federal civil court hierarchy 
  - Federal criminal court hierarchy 
  - 
- The major characteristic that distinguishes federal jurisdiction from state jurisdiction is that federal jurisdiction must always be specifically given.

    - An application for special leave is a hearing by the Court.
    - may lie from
      - a single Supreme Court judge

  - Section 32 of the Federal Court Act (Cth)
    - ‘Associated jurisdiction’—matters
  - the matters arise out of the same facts, or are ‘within the scope of one controversy’ and therefore ‘within the ambit of a matter’, and must be genuine—that is, fairly raised on the facts.
- Federal Circuit Court of Australia
  - Commonwealth Parliament at the end of 1999,
  - entirely civil.
    - family law and child support, property disputes where the value is less than $300 000 unless the parties consent, parenting orders, and determination of parentage—but it is not permitted to hear matters of adoption or the nullity or validity of marriage.
  - shared jurisdiction with the Federal Court in administrative law, bankruptcy, human rights, privacy, and trade practices/consumer law

  - associated jurisdiction
    - a court's ability to hear related matters that fall outside its primary jurisdiction
- Federal tribunals
  - administrative, not judicial, power.
  - not appeals.
- The striking down of the part of the cross-vesting legislation which vested state jurisdiction in federal courts can create problems for litigants who may be forced to commence proceedings in multiple courts to resolve a dispute.
  - It can also create issues of consistency and coordination between the state and federal court systems.
- Federal–state court interaction
  - federal jurisdiction is that exercised by a Chapter III court.
  - state courts to exercise federal judicial power (s 77) (the ‘autochthonous expedient’) as well as state judicial power.
  - Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-Vesting) Act 1987
    - vested the non-federal jurisdiction of the state courts in the Federal Court and the Family Court, and in turn it vested most of the federal jurisdiction in the state Supreme Courts.
  - Re Wakim; ex parte McNally (1999)
    - Held that the 1987 legislation and the corporations law cross-vesting scheme were invalid to the extent that they purported to confer state jurisdiction on federal courts.
    - state could not refer power to a federal court, and it established that the Federal Court(s) cannot hear matters whose only jurisdiction is cross-vested state jurisdiction.
    - there should be a single ‘justiciable controversy’, identifiable separately from the proceedings, with a ‘common substratum of facts’.
- Traveling through the court hierarchy
  - No absolute right of appeal,
- mens rea
  - intent/mental status
- Onus
  - Burden of proof
The judges in the earlier court cases, R v Murrell and R v Bonjon, assume that colonial legal rule is superior and intended for the benefit of white settlers, with little consideration for the rights and interests of First Nations Australians. In contrast, the judgments in Mabo v Queensland (No 2), Love v Commonwealth of Australia; Thoms v Commonwealth of Australia, Walker v New South Wales, and Wik Peoples v Queensland recognize the significance of Indigenous land rights and reject the idea of terra nullius, acknowledging that colonial legal rule has historically marginalized and disadvantaged First Nations Australians. These later judgments suggest a shift towards a more equitable and inclusive legal system.
	
- Privy Council = an advisory body to the British monarch and the court of final appeal in the United Kingdom.
- Reception = the implementation of the colonial nation’s laws after occupation.
- Terra nullius = Latin for land belonging to no one.
- Westminster system = the British system of representative government, consisting of three arms of government: the courts (judicature), parliament (legislature) and executive.
- Customary laws system =  law passed down through the generations by oral tradition (storytelling).
  - Heterogeneous
  - R v Murrell.
    - Murrell argued that the judgment of the Supreme Court on the alleged murder could not be handed down, as judgment could only be handed down by Jabbingee’s family.
    -  New South Wales was neither conquered, ceded, nor a British settlement by occupation. Thus, the Aboriginal people were not bound by English criminal laws in New South Wales. Only the Britons were bound by these laws. The sole exception was where laws ‘protected’ Aboriginal people--this was premised on a contract theory of government: that the right to govern and impose laws on the people was granted in return for their protection.
    - •Aboriginal people had no recognisable laws, but only ‘practices’ that ‘are consistent with a state of the grossest darkness and irrational superstition’. These ‘are founded entirely upon principles … of vindication for personal wrongs’ and ‘the wildest most indiscriminatory notions of revenge’. Thus, Aboriginal people are not ‘entitled to be recognised as … sovereign states governed by laws of their own’.
    - Every First Nations person born in Australia after 1829 became a British subject--although not by their own choosing, or necessarily to their benefit (R v Murrell
- Native title
  - Law Reform Commission of Western Australia identified among Western Australian First Nations societies ‘a defined system of rules for the regulation of human behaviour which has developed over many years from a foundation of moral norms and which attracts specific sanctions for noncompliance’.
- Occupation
  -  it allowed for the automatic reception of English laws, without the need to negotiate a treaty and concede limitations on colonial jurisdiction. The logic behind occupation is that the colonised territory does not have a pre-existing legal system that the colonising nation has to adopt or negotiate with.
  - Too primitive to own land, so they were the only land owners in the area
    - Needed to show land development and cultivation
- The international law doctrine of terra nullius--a colony ‘without settled inhabitants or settled law’--was confirmed in New South Wales in Cooper v Stuart (1889)
  - Mabo v Queensland [No 2] (1992) 175 CLR 126
    - Dispels terra nullius
    - High Court in Mabo (1992) held that, while in 1788 the Crown acquired radical (absolute) title, it did not become the owner of all land.
- R v Bonjon (1841) recognised the possibility of the coexisting application of First Nations laws with Anglo-Australian laws
- Walker v New South Wales in 1994
  -  High Court held that the jurisdiction of the Anglo-Australian criminal law could not be challenged by First Nations laws 
  - The judgment in R v Bonjon (see above) is an example of New South Wales Supreme Court Judge Willis’ refusal to accept the universality of English laws.
- Governor Bourke issued a proclamation that the British Crown was the owner of all Australian territory and solely capable of distributing the land, which the British Colonial Office affirmed on 10 October 1835.
- The Australian Courts Act 1828 (UK) was the statutory instrument for the formal reception of English law.
  - Pursuant to the Imperial Acts Application Act 1969 (NSW), English laws received in 1828 were deemed to be specifically applicable to the colony of New South Wales upon settlement
- Criminal and civil courts were established in 1788 pursuant to the New South Wales Courts Act 1787 (UK) and letters patent from the King dated 2 April 1787
  - It was not until 1810 that the first civilian judge, Ellis Bent, assumed judicial duties in the New South Wales colony
- Magna Carta
  - 1215
  - Great charter
  - Charter of liberties
  - Baron and king John compromise
    - King subject to law, aka rule of law
  - Charter of Liberties was confirmed in 1217, the clauses dealing with the law of the royal forest were taken out and put into a separate document known as ‘the Charter of the Forest’. 
    - Demanding payments to fight a losing war with french "despotic"
    - Articles of the Barons, which sought to reinstate feudal customs and defend the barons against the despotism of the King.
      - Aka charter of liberties
  - Three main clauses today foundation of law
    - The first of these clauses defends the freedom of the English Church (which King John sought to encroach upon). 
      - Church can elect own officials 
      - No royal interference
    - The second enduring clause confirms the liberties and customs of London and other towns. 
    - The main clauses for us
      - No free man shall be seized or imprisoned, or stripped of his rights or possessions, or outlawed or exiled, or deprived of his standing in any other way, nor will we proceed with force against him, or send others to do so, except by the lawful judgment of his equals or by the law of the land.
      - To no one will we sell, to no one deny or delay right or justice.
        - in the fourteenth century, the English Parliament saw it as guaranteeing trial by jury.
        - Foundation of modern bills of rights
- The principles that the Anglo-Australian legal system adopted from England can be summarised in 20 key concepts:
  - Feudalism-
    - The legal obligations to the ruler were formalized with the Norman Conquest in 1066, when William, Duke of Normandy, was crowned King William I and assumed ultimate title to all land in England. 
      - This system developed in England and formed the basis of its land law, criminal legal system and taxation system. 
      - It also forms the basis of Australian law in these areas--the Crown ultimately owns all the land, our criminal system is based on an action by the state against the wrongdoer, and there is an entrenched power for the government to impose taxes.
  - Law as an autonomous discipline
  - Common law legal system
  - Precedent
    - doctrine of precedent requires that the decisions of a court on a matter of law are binding on all courts that are lower in the judicial hierarchy.
  - Equity
    - Checks and balances on courts
    - The Judicature Acts
      - Acts consolidated the various common law courts (which required the filing of writs based on standard forms that were rigid and would give rise to injustice when parties could not comply) and equity courts (which had more flexibility and usually fairness in their procedure).
      - The equity and common law courts came together to form one general court, known as the Supreme Court of Judicature (with different divisions),36 to create uniformity in pleading and procedure.
        - Supreme Court Act 1970
  - Due process
  - Juries
    - Today, a jury usually consists of 12 people in a criminal trial and between four and twelve people in a civil trial,
    - In civil cases, the jury must make a decision as to liability and may also determine the amount of damages awarded
  - Rule of law
    - government should rule through law, and not through the exercise of arbitrary power by individuals.

      - Law applies across the board
      - Upholds legal rights of citizens
      - No punishment without illegal conduct
  - Importance of procedural law
  - Parliament
    - shares power with the monarch, comprising elected representatives.

  - Separation of powers
    - 3 Arms of government:
      - Legislature (pariliament)
      - Executive
      - Judicature
  - Parliamentary sovereignty
    - the parliament is supreme over the executive and the judicature except where it provides otherwise.
  - Independent judiciary 
    - judges should be independent of the other arms of government so that their decisions are made freely, according to law.
      - Security of tenure
        - cannot be removed from their position if their decisions are unpopular to the government of the day,
        - they receive fixed salaries
  - Process of legislation making 
    - draft laws are introduced into parliament and debated, passed and then assented to by the monarch or their representative.

        - Feudal tenure
          - All land was Crown grant
          - Because the land in australia was now Australian (british owned) owned, and because Australian settlers were part of the crown, Australian land became crown land, and crown land can’t be given out without crown permission 
            - The Australian colony is the Crown's property. 
            - No one could claim any right or interest in the land unless the Crown granted them permission.
          - Crown sovereignty gave New South Wales Governor Arthur Phillip right to dispose of lands
          - Common law precedent affirmed feudal tenure in Attorney-General v Brown (1847) 1 Legge 312

          - Sovereign is legal ‘universal occupant’
          - In 1913, Justice Isaacs held in the High Court of Australia case of Williams v Attorney-General (New South Wales) (1913) 16 CLR 404 (at 439)

    - Wanted equal access to education and opportunity 
      - Citizenship rights
  - The Constitution can only be amended by a referendum and requires a Bill to be first passed by the Commonwealth parliament
    - referendum is then put to the Australian people and to pass, it must attract an overall national majority and by a majority in a majority of states.

        - When the federal government passed legislation that stopped heritage protection legislation from applying to the contested area
      - Argument was that 1967 referendum was passed with clear intention that the federal government should only use the power to protect Aboriginal people
      - High court sided with Cth (comonwealth)
        - court told her that, if the federal parliament can grant heritage protection, it is free to take it away if and when it so chooses

- Problem-solving using precedent
  - Not all precedents are created equally
    - High courts and unanimous decision = better
- Introduction to precedent

    - Abide by or adhere
  - ratio decidendi - ratio
    - ground or reason for the decision

  - Kakavas v Crown Melbourne Limited
    - Harry Kakavas, sued Crown Melbourne Limited, the operator of the Crown Casino in Melbourne, for allegedly exploiting his gambling addiction.
      -  allowing him to gamble large sums of money at their casino, despite knowing that he had a gambling addiction.
      - problem gambling and the responsibility of casinos to protect vulnerable customers.
    - The leading case on unconscionability is Commercial Bank of Australia v Amadio (1983) 151 CLR 447
      - parents of a builder had guaranteed their son’s business loans with the bank, 
        - little understanding of English and little education, they didn’t understand that the business was not going well,
        - the guarantee was unlimited
        - and they could lose their home. 
      - Court in common found no issue, but equity said that the parents were at ‘special disadvantage’ and told the bank to go away
    - Ratio is the tipping point to the argument
      - In this case, how the precedent would be applied, was he at special disadvantage
    -  Louth v Diprose [1992] HCA 61
      - extent of knowledge the defendant must have of the plaintiff’s disability
        - unconscionable for the defendant to take advantage of the plaintiff
    - Indifference to his gambling addiction was not enough, they needed to take advantage of the state to be at ‘special disadvantage’
- Case law and precedent
  - Case law = common law

  - Donoghue v Stevenson
    - found the decomposed remains of a snail in a bottle of gingerbeer she was drinking

  - Summarizing a case
    - For classpreparation, it is often sufficient to note onlythe followinginformation:
      - citation;
      - brief statement of material facts;
      - ground(s) of appeal and/or issue(s) to be decided;
      - reason(s) for decision; and
      - Decision.
  - Detailed analysis of case
    - citation;
    - court, including single judge, Full Court or Court of Appeal;
    - brief statement of material facts;
    - Procedural history
    - Grounds for appeal and/or issued to be decided
    - Summary of court’s analysis of law
    - Principle of law to be applied;
    - Description of how law was applied to the facts;
    - decision;
    - orders made by the court; and
    - any features of the case suggesting that it should be viewed in its social or cultural context.
  - Italicized need to be repeated for each issue that the court discusses
- The hierarchy of authority
  -  each state has its own court hierarchy, with the High Court at the top
  - Farah v Say-Dee [2007] HCA 22; (2007) 230 CLR 89
    - intermediate appellate courts have to follow other intermediate courts unless they are plainly wrong.
    - lower appellate courts should be bound by seriously considered dicta of the majority of the High Court.
















- Rules of law derived from cases are not in fixed verbal form
  - Wording on common law might be similar, but different judges apply it slightly differently
  - Doctrine of precedent rules
    -  each court is bound by decisions of courts higher in its hierarchy;
    - a decision of a court in a different hierarchy or lower in the same hierarchy may be persuasive but not binding;
    - a court is not bound by its own pastd ecisions but will depart from them with reluctance;
    - Only the ratio decidendi (the reason for the decision) of a case is binding
    - obiter dicta (remarks in passing)are not considered binding but may be persuasive;
    - precedents do not lose their force by lapse of time; and
    - previous court decisions only apply to the legal principles used to make the decision (ratio decidendi), not to the factual findings made by the court. 
      - Additionally, a lower court is not bound by the factual findings of a higher court, especially in a different case.
    -  Kinsella v Solicitorforthe Northern Territ
      - often creates conflicts between two important goals. 
        - On the one hand, people want a final and clear outcome to their legal disputes, so they know where they stand. 
        - On the other hand, people want to make sure that justice is served in each individual case
          - which may not always be the same as past decisions.
    - occupier’s liability
      - the liability, generally upon the occupier rather than the owner, to compensate persons injured on premises, owing to their dangerous state
  - Ratio decidendi 
    - This can be expressed by saying that the doctrine of precedent will view as a ratio only a ruling on a point of law rather than a statement of a rule of law•. 
  - LEVEL OF GENERALITY
    - Cases that are worded to apply only to the specific facts of that case are of limited precedential value 
      - while restating a rule at a higher level of generality allows it to encompass a wider range of factual circumstances and increases its value as a precedent.
- Precedent and Change
  -  Dorset Yacht Co Ltd v Home Office
    - previous cases had not usually allowed a duty of care in negligence to arise in such circumstances—where the defendant was a public authority, 
      - where the damage was caused not directly by the defendant but by a third party’s voluntary action. 
    - Natural law is broadly a belief in a system of law common to all people
      - derived from the supreme force in the universe, or God. 
    - positivism in law, 
    - broadly, is a belief in a system of law created by men.
      - Such law is recognisable by its pedigree or how it was created
      - rather than whether it is right or wrong. 
- Bugmy v R (2013)
  - Cause of Appeal	
    - Director of Public Prosecutions appealed the case on the grounds that the sentence was inadequate
    - Two key legal issues - Ratio
      - An appellate court cannot adjust a sentence unless it first makes an explicit finding that the original sentence was manifestly inadequate.
      - Sentencing factors should relate to the individual offender, be it Aboriginal or non-Aboriginal — 
        - generic and systemic factors such as incarceration statistics are not relied upon.
        - In sentencing, full weight should be given to an offender’s deprived background, regardless of the intervening years and offences.
  - Laws violated 
    - Section 60A(1) makes it an offence to assault a correctional officer while the officer is acting in the execution of his or her duty.
    - Section 33(1)(b) makes it an offence to cause grievous bodily harm to a person with intent to cause harm of that kind.
  - Facts
    - Criminal background - in and out of prison since 13 to 29
    - Mental impairment
      - Caused court to reconsider his sentence due to personal circumstances
    - Took Fernando considerations into account
      - raised in an Aboriginal community with alcohol abuse and violence
      - Fernando was intoxicated at the time
      - If raised in a community like this, the offender’s moral culpability is likely less than those whose formative years were better
    - Courts are waiting for legislative to fix natives incarcerated
    - Wood J proposed that being unfamilkiar with European ways would make a lengthy term particularly burdensome
    - the appellant’s submission that courts should take judicial notice of the systemic background of deprivation of Aboriginal offenders cannot be accepted
  - Director’s issues
    - ‘Ground 1: failed to determine the degree of the offence.
    - Ground 2: failed to acknowledge the victim as a serving prison officer performing his duties.
    - Ground 3: Judge weighed the facts of the case too leniently.’
      - The appellant argued that the three additional grounds were just details of the main issue of manifest inadequacy. 
      - The Director didn't argue otherwise but said that the errors found were like manifest inadequacy. 
      - The problem is that the Court of Criminal Appeal either found manifest inadequacy or not. 
        - The Court's holding said that they didn't need to address the issue of manifest inadequacy because the errors identified required a resentencing. 
        - This contradicts the argument that there was an implicit finding of manifest inadequacy.
  - Results
    - Court of Criminal Appeal disagreed with the sentence imposed by Judge Lerve and favoured a more severe sentence.
    - Appeals said that Judge Lerve gave too much weight to fernando in this case
    - Must not treat aboriginal offenders different, if so, individual justice is meaningless
    - Brennan J in Neal v The Queen [(1982) 149 CLR 305], 
      - the weight to be afforded to the effects of social deprivation in an offender’s youth and background is in each case for individual assessment.
- Government initiatives in customary sentencing
  - Circle sentencing (NSW)
    - community elders, the victim (if they choose), the offender and their lawyer, family members of the offender and victim, the prosecutor and the magistrate sit  together in a circle to discuss and decide upon a sentence by consensus
  - Koori court (VIC)
    -  Magistrates’ Court (Koori Court) Act 2002  (Vic)
    - Magistrate has ultimate authority, with input from community, victims, etc
  - Murri court (QLD)

    - take into account the views of Indigenous community representatives when sentencing Indigenous offenders
-  FILLING THE LEGAL GAP—TREATY AND SOVEREIGNTY RIGHTS
  - Treaty of Waitangi - 1840 (NZ)
  - 1990 Aboriginal Provisional Government (APG)
    - Wanted Aboriginal state
      - All control vesting in indigenous communities
        - Want crown land and additional land
          - Half of Australia 
        - Compensation for the transfer of the remaining land to Oz (pay for the land that the Oz government gets from the natives)
        - Natives not subject to Australian law unless consented
        - Natives would be self-governing, but could choose to live in white Australia
        - Law boundaries (White law vs traditional law)
        - International law when differences between white Oz and native Oz
        - Operate as a state internationally 
- Applying precedent
  - Precedent is mainly used in courts
  - Tribunals are also bound by court precedent
    - do not use decisions of previous tribunals as a precedent. 
  - Most cases turn on their facts
    - Mainly appellate courts that grapple with interesting legal questions
  - Precedent argument
    - If in favor
      - and try to convince the judge to follow the reasoning in those past decisions that are in their favour.
    - If not 	
      - Decision is somehow  materially different from the present case, and that it therefore does not apply.
  - Material facts
    - Which facts are important 
  - If overruled in a higher court due to reasoning, it is no longer valid precedent
      - Does not reopen the original case, res judicata 
    - If considered
      - Thought about but not followed nor distinguished from present case
    - If cited
      - Referred to without being considered
    - The original decision, on appeal, may be:
      - Upheld
        - Court agrees withy original decision
      - Reversed
        - Court agrees with arguments raised on appeal 
  - Cases cited in Namoa v R
    - Woman argued that planning terrorism with husband was not conspiracy, as spouses are one person
    - High Court cited 23 cases
      - 2 from previous court, 12 previous High Court decisions, and 8 from overseas courts
    - High court ruled that spousal rule is not part of conspiracy. 
      - Dismissed her case upheld previous court decision. 
  - Find out if case has been overruled or used for further rulings
    - Gerlach v Clifton Bricks Pty Ltd (2002) 209 CLR 478
      - Has been used in over 200 cases
        - Applied is best
        - Then considered
        - Then cited
- When are precedents binding?
  - Only the ratio is used as precedent in a past case
  - Decisions can be 
    - Binding
      - court is bound to follow the previous decision
        - If not, likely that the decision will be appealed to a higher court.
      - Each state has its own hierarchy, and federal is different than state courts not above
      - Same court decisions
        - A full court decision will bind a single judge, and a single judge may depart from a single judge.  
        - A current full court can depart from single judge or previous full court
    - Persuasive
      - Likely to follow any precedent that falls within similar rank or higher
        - A different state supreme court
        - English House of Lords
    - Largely irrelevant
      - Often for international cases, and for smaller courts, i.e., india and district court
  - Precedents from appeal courts in order of persuasiveness. 
    - Unanimous
      - Full bench arrived at the same outcome, best case to find ratio
      - Single, unanimous judgement
    - Majority
      - Odd judges in a full court, whichever position has the most judges is majority
    - Minority/dissenting
      - Converse to majority. 
      - Minority or dissenting judgements
    - Joint
      - Two+ judges write one judgement between them.
      - May be unanimous, majority, or minority
    - Individual
  - Wik Peoples v Queensland
    - 4 judges majority vs 3 judges
      - Each of the four justices in the majority reached the same outcome using different reasoning, 
        - this makes finding a ratio, to be used as a precedent, difficult if not impossible. 
  - Justices Gummow and Hayne in Re Wakim; Ex parte McNally (1999) 198 CLR 511, 570
    - considered that the decision of an equally divided High Court ‘established no principle or precedent having authority in this court’.
- How are precedents avoided or distinguished?
  - most common method of avoiding a precedent
    - distinguishing a case on fact.
  - Lawyers ethically must bring up all cases involved, even if they do not completely support your position
    - Full disclosure
- Judicial approaches to precedent
  - Judges shouldn’t but do make law
  - Do you follow law as written or make reasonable adjustments
  - Declaratory theory
    - Judges declare how law is, not how it should be
    - “Applying the law” when actually making law
  - Legal correctness
    - Law can be explained in a series of rules. 
    - Always one correct answer
    - black-letter law

    - Through want of care
  - 4 kirby guideposts as boundaries of judicial activism
    - Opportunity
      - Need a case that addresses the issue
    - Need

- The importance of legal research	
  - Primary data 
    - is collected by the researchers themselves, such as through conducting surveys or interviews.
  - Secondary data 
    - census information and statistics, and past reported survey results.
  - Doctrinal research 
    - involves locating particular law and analysing the issues that arise
  - Methodology or Strategy for legal research
    - Step 1: What are you trying to find?
    - Step 2: Decide on your research strategy
    - Step 3: Locate the rules that govern the legal issues
    - Step 4: Interpret and analyse results of your research Step 5: Apply research results to the facts in support of particular argument
- Case Law
  - Authorised reports

      - Only  equitable  remedies  can be awarded   in  the  exclusive  jurisdiction; 
      - common   law  damages  are   never   available.  In  the  auxiliary  jurisdiction,  however,  a  court considers whether damages  will  adequately  compensate  for  the  plaintiffs  loss, and only  if  that remedy is not   adequate   will  the   award of an   equitable  remedy be considered.  
      - Damages   are inadequate  if  a   money   award   will   not   enable  the  plaintiff  to  purchase  a   market   substitute  for the  defendant's  performance.

  - Clark v Malpas
    - STEPS TO ANAYLSE CASE 
    - Note the name of the case and its citation
      - Clark v Malpas (1862) 31 Beav 80; 54 ER 1067
    - Clarify the procedural history of the case. 
      - No procedural history
    - Ascertain the material facts
      - In Clark v Malpas,the material facts relate to
        - the vendor's personal circumstances (old,seriously ill, illiterate),
        - the value ofthe property(aboutÂ£380), the price actually paid
        - 100 to heir plus 12s (shillings) per week and free rent for life)
        - and the circumstances in which the transaction occurred 
          - (the purchaser knew that the vendor was ill, the vendor had no independent advice, the transaction was completed very quickly and the vendor died soon afterward
    - State the issue raised bythe material facts and how the court answered it (theresult of the case
      - In Clark v Malpas, the facts raised this issue: 
        - is it fair for a party to retain the benefit of a bargain where the contract is hastily executed and the other party is a sick old man who received no independent advice and inadequate consideration? 
          - And the court's answer? No
    - Identify the reasoning which supported the decision and the ratio of the case.
      - In this case it’s facts, so not much ratio (mostly appellate has ratio)
      - Defendant used precedent that was distinguished by judge due to material difference
        - Previous case gave seller time to move deliberately into transaction
      - Example ratio: where the sale of property is for a very inadequate consideration and the circumstances establish that the vendor requires the protection of the law, 
        - the burden is on the purchaser to prove that the transaction was entered into carefully, deliberately and with full knowledge

    - Took it to High Court of Australia
  - Ascertain the material facts
    - The amadios were under the impression that when they executed and guaranteed the mortgage that their maximum potential liability was $50,000, which was in fact unlimited. 
    - The bank maliciously withheld information from the couple and misrepresented the actual agreement 
    - Did not provide adequate information and confirm understanding in a situation where clearly necessary 
  - State the issue raised by the material facts and how the court answered it (the result of the case)
    - Amadio builders were going through a severe liquidity crisis. Bank tricked parents to use entire property to cover any future debt rather than 50,000 as told.
    - Bank and builder were actually partners, and builders were by father most important customer
    - National bank that Vinchenzo went to get loan actually suggested that they secure Amadio builders indebtedness (never could repay) and was aware of deception with parents
      - No independent advice, and only learned a few hours ago, no explanation made
    - Bank argued that Mr Virgo assumed Vincenzo explained everything (not legit)
      - Vincenzo never read the document
  - Identify the reasoning which supported the decision and the ratio of the case.
    - The whole transaction should properly be seen as flowing from the special disability which was evident to the bank and as being unfair, unjust and unreasonable. 
    - They did not fully understand the terms which they were entering the agreement, and the bank made little effort to purposely victimize the couple
  - Obiter
    - If Mr. and Mrs. Amadio's potential liability had been limited to a maximum of $50,000, and if they had been informed as to the true financial position of Amadio Builders, it would be strongly arguable that the guarantee/mortgage could not properly be said either to have resulted from their special disability or to be other than fair, just and reasonable
  - STEPS TO ANAYLSE CASE 
  - Note the name of the case and its citation
    -  Louth v Diprose (1992) 175 CLR 621
  - Clarify the procedural history of the case. 
    -  On her refusal he commenced proceedings in the Supreme Court of South Australia for a declaration that he was beneficially entitled to the land.
    - An appeal by Louth to the Full Court (Jacobs A.C.J. and Legoe J., Matheson J. dissenting) was dismissed. 
    - She appealed from that Court to the High Court pursuant to special leave. 
  - Ascertain the material facts
    - Man (Diprose) gave $58,000 to a woman (Louth) he was infatuated with
      - Woman was largely indifferent to the man
    - Money used to purchase a house for the woman and her children from a previous marriage
      - Woman registered as the proprietor of the house
    - Relationship between parties deteriorated
    - Man filed a lawsuit to recover the land
    - Judge found:
      - Woman created a crisis atmosphere to influence man to provide money for the house
      - Woman used man's love and suicide threats to manipulate him
        - Woman was aware of man's infatuation and inability to judge his best interests
    - 
  - State the issue raised by the material facts and how the court answered it (the result of the case)
    - Courts of equity can provide relief in cases of unconscionable dealing. 
    - Relief can be granted if:
      - One party in the transaction had a special disability that created an imbalance between the two parties, making it difficult for them to deal with each other fairly.
      - The other party was aware of this special disability, and it would be considered unfair or unconscionable for them to take advantage of the disadvantaged party's agreement to the transaction.
    - whether a gift by the respondent to the appellant was open to challenge on the ground of either unconscionable conduct or undue influence.
  - Identify the reasoning which supported the decision and the ratio of the case.
    - Court ordered the woman to transfer the house to the man
    - Full Court of the Supreme Court upheld the findings and dismissed the woman's appeal

Introduction
- Briefly identify the case by party name and citation, the nature of
the legal issue or issues and perhaps suggest why this case may be
of interest
Procedural History
- Is it an appeal from a first instance decision or has there been a
series of appeals? 
- If the latter it might be useful to discuss the reasoning in previous decisions
Facts
- What are the circumstances in which the dispute arose?
- Think about what is relevant to the law. 
  - You only need to provide enough factual information to explain how the legal issues arose.
- Identify the parties clearly and be consistent; 
  - for example avoid referring to the applicant, plaintiff, aggrieved party or party by name interchangeably.
Legal Issues
- What is the applicable law, or what has been argued to be the applicable law?
- Is the dispute about defining specific circumstances when a particular legal principle may be relevant? 
  - For example, whether in the circumstances has a duty of care arisen and if there has been a breach of the duty of care; 
  - or whether a particular term in a contract be interpreted in a specific way and if that term has been breached based on that interpretation.
Decision
- What is the outcome of the case?
- What was the law the judge or judges applied?
- What is the reasoning of the judge or judges that has led to that
outcome?
Analysis
- Does the reasoning support the decision?
- If it is a split decision (there is a dissenting judgment) is the majority's approach convincing?
- If the case is the outcome of a series of appeals how does the decision reconcile or justify earlier decisions?
- How has the case been treated subsequently?
- Are there any social implications? Will this affect business practice

  - Note the name of the case and its citation
    - Barret v MoD (1995) 1 WLR 1217. 
  - Clarify the procedural history of the case.
    - Court of Appeal
  - Ascertain the material facts
    - Off-duty  sailor dying following drinking bout  at  naval  base
    - Placed in bunk in recovery position
  - State the issue raised by the material facts
    -  Law(s) broken
      - Article 1810 Queen’s Rgulations for the Royal Navy 1967 
      - Fatal Accidents Act 1967
      - Law Reform Act 1934
    - Officer in  command   at  base guilty  of  breach  of  regulations relating to  discouragement  of drunkenness Whether  Ministry  of  Defence  under  duty  to  prevent 
    - deceased from   excessive indulgence in  alcoho
    - Whether  ministry  taking   adequate   measures   after  deceased   collapsed
    - Whether deceased  guilty of  contributory negligence
  - Identify the reasoning which supported the decision and the ratio of the case.
    - when the  defendant  assumed   responsibility for  him,  the  measures  taken fell short  of  the  standard  reasonably  to  be  expected;  and   that, accordingly, since it was  the  deceased's lack  of  self-control in  his own  interest   that   caused  the   defendant  to   have  to   assume responsibility for  him,  the  damages   recoverable  by  the  plaintiff would   be  reduced  by  two-thirds  
    - Appeal
      - (l)  the  judge  erred  in  law  in  holding  that 
      - the  defendant  owed   the  deceased  a  duty  of  care;  
      - (2)  in  concluding  that such  a  duty  of  care  existed,the  judge  erroneously had   regard  to  the 
Queen's   Regulations  and   various  standing  orders  as  determining  the existence, as  opposed  to  the  extent, of  the  postulated duty;  
(3)  the  judge erroneously  relied  upon   Barnett  v.  Chelsea  and   Kensington  Hospital Management   Committee  [1969] I  Q.B.  428  as  authority for  the  proposition that  it  was   "just  and   reasonable"  to  impose   a  duty   of  care  upon   the 
Defendant;5+6+4
(4)  if the  judge  was  correct in  imposing  a  duty  of  care  in that  regard,  then  he  erred  in  law  in  rejecting the defendant's contention that  the  maxim   volenti non  fit injuria applied to  negative any  breach  of such  duty.
    - Judge phelan awarded 162k, 25% decrease due to burden on dead soldier (his responsibility)
    - Bedlam LJ
      - Lt cmd Lomax was unusually lax with alcohol
      - Pleaded guilty
      - Was required to take appropriate action to prevent death
        - Notes in guidance of followed would have prevented his death
        - Tossing and turning, and was checked on 3 times
      - The  defendant's principal ground  of  appeal  is that the  judge  was  wrong   to  hold  that  it was  under  any  duty  to  take  care  to see  that  the  deceased, a  mature  man   30  years  of  age,  did  not  consume   so much   alcohol  that  he   became   unconscious to  exercise control  in  his  own   interest as  well  as  in  the interest of  others.
      - To  dilute self-responsibility and  to  blame  one  adult  for another's lack  of  self-control is  neither just  nor  reasonable and  in  the development  of  the  law  of  negligence an  increment  too  far
    - In  the  present  case  I  would   reverse  the  judge's  finding  that  the defendant  was   under  a  duty  to  take  reasonable care  to  prevent  the deceased from  abusing  alcohol to  the  extent he  did.  Until  he  collapsed, I  would   hold  that  the  deceased  was   in  law   alone  responsible  for  his condition.
    - Thereafter, when  the  defendant assumed  responsibility for  him, it accepts that  the  measures  taken  fell short  of  the  standard  reasonably to be  expected. It  did  not  summon   medical  assistance and  its supervision of him  was  inadequate. 
    - Other justices agreed
  - Obiter 
  - Result
    - Too much responsibility on the defendant for a grown man's decision, ⅔ reduction down to $71,500 with interest
    - Further appeal by prosecution dismissed
- STEPS TO ANAYLSE CASE 
  - Note the name of the case and its citation
    - Hackett (a pseudonym) v Secretary, Department of Communities and Justice (2020) 379 ALR 248
  - Clarify the procedural history of the case. 
  - Ascertain the material facts
    - She was in adoption system and was to be officially adopted by adoptive mother
    - 12 years or less cannot be adopted without bio father consent
      - Not necessary for 12+ and mature enough to understand
  - State the issue raised by the material facts

    - (ii) Whether the applicant had been denied procedural fairness. 
    - Primary Judge results - Father appeals this
      - (a)  adopting  Belinda  as the  daughter  of  the  woman  in  whose  household  she has lived  for  almost  all  of  her  life,  
      - (b) giving  Belinda  that  woman’s  surname,    
      - (c)  two  orders  giving  effect  to  two  adoption plans  concerning  what would  happen  in  the  future  until  Belinda turns  18. 
  - Identify the reasoning which supported the decision and the ratio of the case.
    - Leeming JA
      - Belina pseudonym 
      - Aboriginal child
        -  either  a child  is,  or  is  not,  an  “Aboriginal child” or  a “Torres  Strait  Islander  child”. 
        - Same for young person
        - Must apply “Aboriginal” or “Torres Straight Islander” Child Placement Principles
          -  first preference to be given to same culture parents
          - Must be put with aboriginal parent unless court is satisfied
      - Supreme  Court is  required  to consider  the  cultural heritage  of  the  prospective adoptive  parent  and  whether  he or  she will assist in the preservation of the cultural heritage of the child.
      - Three important points
        - Belinda’s adoptive mother is not Aboriginal. 
        - Belinda’s father is not aboriginal (therefore mother is Aboriginal)
        - Belinda will not be adopted by Aboriginal members due to Aboriginal child placement principles
      - The tests for determining who is an Aboriginal child 
        - in  order  for  a  child  to  be  an “Aboriginal child”,  it was  necessary to  identify  an  ancestor  of  the  child  who  was  “a member of the Aboriginal  race  of  Australia, and  identified  as  an  Aboriginal  person,  and  was  accepted  by the  Aboriginal  community  as an  Aboriginal  person.”  
        - Primary judge was not convinced based on the presented evidence that she was aboriginal
      - Primary Judge results - Father appeals this
        - (a)  adopting  Belinda  as the  daughter  of  the  woman  in  whose  household  she has lived  for  almost  all  of  her  life,  
        - (b) giving  Belinda  that  woman’s  surname,    
        - (c)  two  orders  giving  effect  to  two  adoption plans  concerning  what would  happen  in  the  future  until  Belinda turns  18. 
      - Appeal 
        -  Too narrow test of aboriginal child
          - She now would be aboriginal for adoption purposes
        - The  respondent made  no  submission  to  the  contrary, consistent  with  his  not  taking  a  position  on  the  correct  construction of s  4(2)  in   Fischer  v Thompson.
        - 
  - Obiter 
  - Result
    - Held, granting leave to appeal
    -  definition  of  “Aboriginal child” in   Fischer  v Thompson  is  too  narrow,  and  that there  should  be a  grant of  leave  to appeal
    -   S 4(2)  was  to  permit  a  Court  to  determine  that  a  child  who would  qualify  under  the descent  definition was  an  Aboriginal child,  even  if  no  ancestor satisfied the three-limb definition in the Aboriginal Land Rights Act.
    - I  am  satisfied  that Belinda  is  of Aboriginal  descent,  meaning  that  she  is  descended  from  the  people  who  lived  in  this country before British colonisation.

- Problem question methods

    - State the relevant law and cite authority for it.
    - Apply the law to the facts.
    - Reach a conclusion.

  - Note the name of the case and its citation

      - not to be a prearranged “defilement” or “abuse” or misuse of the statue
      - Victorian Act
        - preservation of order and decorum in streets and other public places
      -  “improper” has a much wider meaning than “offensive”.
        - offensive behavior if it can be said that conduct is hurtful, blameworthy or improper, and thus may offend.
      - persistence is not separately relied upon; it is the original conduct which is said to have been offensive, and for that reason its continuance is also alleged to have been offensive.
      - What the police thought doesn’t matter, it’s the reasonable person


  - Ascertain the material facts
    - It was proved that on 16th March, 1966, the defendant climbed on to a pedestal on which a statue of King George V stood and hung a placard, on which was printed in large letters the words “I will not fight in Vietnam”, from a part of the statue.
    - squatted down at the foot of the statue and on top of the pedestal for about twenty minutes, refusing to come down when requested to do so by the police.
    - If the statue were in fact defiled or abused, then strong feelings of resentment might well have been calculated to arise
    - There is no criticism by the Crown of that political protest or demonstration as such. I have found as facts that: (a) the climbing on the pedestal of the statue and the hanging of the placard from part of the statue were an unpremeditated part of the political protest; (b) the conduct was not a student's prank or joke or stunt, but was originally undertaken in an incidental fashion as a means—even if a peculiar means—of drawing wider public attention to the protest. 
    - Sergeant resentment was of silly conduct, a normal reaction
  - State the issue raised by the material facts 
    - Law(s)/Statue(s) in contention
      - Police Offences Ordinance 1930 (ACT), s 17(d), with behaving in an offensive manner in a public place and convicted.
        - Section 17 (d) of the Police Offences Ordinance says: “Any person who, in or near any public place, or within the view or hearing of any person therein behaves in a threatening, abusive, offensive or insulting manner, shall be guilty of an offense”
    - Precedences
      -  Anderson v. Kynaston
        -  “offensive” has  to be considered in connexion with the associated words “behavior”, “manner”, “view or hearing” and “public place
      - Worcester v. Smith
        -  In that case the defendant was one of a party of persons carrying banners outside the United States Consulate in Melbourne.

          - Did not care about the politics
      - Defense 
  - Obiter 
    - Conduct which offends against the standards of good taste or good manners, which is a breach of the rules of courtesy or runs contrary to commonly accepted social rules, may well be ill-advised, hurtful, not proper conduct.
  - Identify the legal reasoning and the ratio of the case.
    - A reasonable man may have been offended by lack of good taste, but not wounded, or disgusted, or outraged. 
  - Result
    - On appeal
    - The behavior complained of considered in its full setting was not a prearranged defilement, abuse or misuse of the statue but an incidental resort to it during the political protest or demonstration with the emphasis on the protest and not on some mistreatment of the statue and, as such, was not “offensive” behavior within the meaning of s 17(d).
-  Summary Offenses Act 1988 (NSW) s 4

  - Reasonable excuse
    - Justice Mclnemy found that the test to be applied was: 
      - what would the attitude of a reasonably tolerant bystander be in the circumstances ... in my view there is no answer other than such an objective observer would conclude the language was offensive
      - No provocation in public by that person, personal provocation in home
      - The language was offensive
