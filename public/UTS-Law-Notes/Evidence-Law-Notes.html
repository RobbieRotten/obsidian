</li>
<li>Evidence
<ul>
<li>What is evidence?
<ul>
<li>Evidence is the information (facts) received by the Court in its efforts to determine the existence of some other matter of fact. Sometimes referred to as a proof model.</li>
<li>‚Äúit encompasses, in my view, at least all of those matters which one party must prove in order to succeed in the proceeding and that the other must prove to establish its defence‚Äù per Branson J</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why do we need rules / laws that govern the use of evidence?</li>
<li>Three main reasons:
<ul>
<li>Fairness ‚Äì a way of ensuring that the parties are treated fairly.</li>
<li>Efficiency ‚Äì a way of limiting extraneous material to ensure the effective and efficient conduct of Court matters.</li>
<li>Standardisation ‚Äì allows for a degree of standardisation across all Court matters (consistency and certainty).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Uniform Evidence Legislation
<ul>
<li>Originally we had the Common Law Rules of Evidence ‚Äì very complicated, convoluted and difficult to apply.</li>
<li>In the 1980‚Äôs ALRC conducted inquiry into problems associated with evidence.
<ul>
<li>Resulted in Uniform Evidence Acts (1995) in NSW and Cth jurisdictions</li>
<li>Since that time other States and Territories have adopted the approach.</li>
<li>Although the various Acts are described as ‚ÄòUniform‚Äô, there are some differences between them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Evidence Act Structure
<ul>
<li>In NSW, the use of evidence in both Criminal and Civil matters is governed by the Uniform Evidence Act 1995 (EA)</li>
<li>Structure of EA is designed to allow for a more systematic approach to the assessment of admissibility.</li>
<li>Under the EA, every piece of evidence needs to be rigorously assessed to assess whether, or not, it is admissible.</li>
<li>Broken into major Chapters including:
<ul>
<li>Chapter 1 - Preliminary matters (application of the Act)</li>
<li>Chapter 2 - Adducing evidence</li>
<li>Chapter 3 - Admissibility</li>
<li>Chapter 4 - Proof</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Under the EA, evidence may be classified as either:
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Testimonial (oral / written evidence given by a Witness) (oath by one‚Äôs testicles)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Documents (papers, electronic recording etc)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Other evidence (views, re-enactments, real evidence - eg the weapon)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>EA allows the Court to ensure that facts are proven in a methodical and consistent manner.</li>
<li>Under the Uniform Evidence Act 1995 (EA) evidence is based on admissibility through:
<ul>
<li>The concept of Relevance.</li>
<li>The use of Exclusionary Rules.</li>
<li>The Use of Discretionary Rules.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Aim is to be more ‚ÄòInclusionary‚Äô than ‚ÄòExclusionary‚Äô.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Admissibility ‚Äì A 3-Stage Process
<ul>
<li>In assessing the admissibility of evidence, the Court undertakes a three-stage process where each threshold must be met before moving to the next step:
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Relevant / Not Relevant?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>If Relevant, are there any Exclusionary Rules that apply?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="3">
<li>If no Exclusionary Rule applies, should the Trial Judge use Discretion to exclude the evidence?</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>

<li>Documentary Evidence Real Evidence
<ul>
<li>Documents Generally
<ul>
<li>Understanding how documents can be used in Court / Litigation is an important skill for a lawyer to possess. Can be a very potent tool when handled correctly.</li>
<li>Many forms of litigation rely heavily on documents being adduced as evidence.</li>
<li>EA made significant changes to the Common Law about how documents can be adduced. Common Law was very strict on the notion of only using original documents.</li>
<li>Part 2.2 of the EA deals with how the contents of documents can be adduced. Deals with how originals, copies, extracts, summaries etc can be tendered in order to bring the contents of the document before the Court.</li>
<li>Should be noted that proving the content of a document is a different issue to how the content of the document is used/assessed in evidence. Getting the content of the document into evidence should be considered the first step.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Definition of ‚ÄúDocument‚Äù
<ul>
<li>In the Dictionary of the EA</li>
<li>‚Äúdocument‚Äù means any record of information, and includes:</li>
<li>(a) anything on which there is writing, or</li>
<li>(b) anything on which there are marks, figures, symbols or perforations having a meaning for persons qualified to interpret them, or</li>
<li>(c) anything from which sounds, images or writings can be reproduced with or without the aid of anything else, or</li>
<li>(d) a map, plan, drawing or photograph.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Clause 8 Part 2 of the Dictionary:
<ul>
<li>References to documents
<ul>
<li>A reference in this Act to a document includes a reference to:
<ul>
<li>(a) any part of the document, or</li>
<li>(b) any copy, reproduction or duplicate of the document or of any part of the document, or</li>
<li>(c) any part of such a copy, reproduction or duplicate</li>

<li>Proof of Contents of Documents
<ul>
<li>Main guidance as to the various ways that the contents of a document can be brought into evidence are dealt with under s 48 EA.</li>
<li>Under the EA, it is possible to:
<ul>
<li>-Tender the document itself
<ul>
<li>‚Äì s 48(1)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>-Tender a copy of it
<ul>
<li>‚Äì s 48(1)(b)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>-Adduce evidence as to its contents
<ul>
<li>‚Äì s 48(1)(a)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>-Tender a transcript of it
<ul>
<li>‚Äì s 48(1)(c)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>-For voluminous documents, it is also possible to tender a summary (with leave)
<ul>
<li>‚Äì s50.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>s 48 also provides a way of utilising the contents of a document even though the document in question is not available to the party. (ss 48(2) and 48(4) refer)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Section 48(4) Proof of Contents of Documents
<ul>
<li>s 48(4) A party may adduce evidence of the contents of a document in question that is not available to the party, or the existence and contents of which are not in issue in the proceeding, by:
<ul>
<li>(a) tendering a document that is a copy of, or an extract from or summary of, the document in question, or</li>
<li>(b) adducing from a witness evidence of the contents of the document in question.</li>

<li>Definition of ‚Äúunavailable‚Äù
<ul>
<li>Part 2 of the Dictionary: 5 Unavailability of documents and things</li>
<li>For the purposes of this Act, a document or thing is taken not to be available to a party if and only if:
<ul>
<li>(a) it cannot be found after reasonable inquiry and search by the party, or</li>
<li>(b) it was destroyed by the party, or by a person on behalf of the party, otherwise than in bad faith, or was destroyed by another person, or</li>
<li>(c) it would be impractical to produce the document or thing during the course of the proceeding, or</li>
<li>(d) production of the document or thing during the course of the proceeding could render a person liable to conviction for an offence, or</li>
<li>(e) it is not in the possession or under the control of the party and:
<ul>
<li>(i) it cannot be obtained by any judicial procedure of the court, or</li>
<li>(ii) it is in the possession or under the control of another party to the proceeding concerned who knows or might reasonably be expected to know that evidence of the contents of the document, or evidence of the thing, is likely to be relevant in the proceeding, or</li>
<li>(iii) it was in the possession or under the control of such a party at a time when that party knew or might reasonably be expected to have known that such evidence was likely to be relevant in the proceeding.</li>

<li>R v Cassar &amp; Sleiman [1999] NSWSC 651
<ul>
<li>D‚Äôs claimed that on the night of the incident they were driving around in a car.
<ul>
<li>P was given leave to adduce evidence in reply that would show car was elsewhere on that night.</li>
<li>Police had evidence that car was at a motel at the time.</li>
<li>What was this evidence and how was it adduced?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Evidence was contained in a motel registration form which recorded name, address, car rego, check in date and room charge.
<ul>
<li>Problem was that the registration form could not be found and therefore could not be produced as evidence, at trial.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Evidence regarding existence of such registration forms and their general content was given by the motel employee, on duty that night.</li>
<li>Evidence as to the content of the registration form was given by police officer who had inspected the original registration form and recorded the name, address, vehicle registration and payment details etc on a piece of paper.
<ul>
<li>This information was then faxed to another police officer who recorded it on a ‚Äòrunning sheet‚Äô.</li>
<li>Sadly, the piece of paper and the fax of it could not be found at trial.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Only remaining evidence was the police running sheet. The question was whether that was admissible to prove the contents of the original motel registration form ????</li>
<li>Court held that:
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Section 48(4)(a) provides that a party may adduce evidence of the contents of a document that is not available by tendering a document that is a summary of, or an extract from, the document in question. The running sheet was therefore admissible (it incorporated the salient details) pursuant to s 48(4)(a).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>The police officer should have leave, pursuant to s 42 EA, to use the running sheet to try to revive his memory.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="3">
<li>The police officer could then give oral evidence of what he saw recorded in the original registration form pursuant to s 48(4)(b), using the running sheet to refresh his recollection.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="4">
<li>The registration form was a business record of the kind referred to in s 69EA and that proof of the contents of the form would be evidence of the fact.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Real Evidence
<ul>
<li>Real Evidence
<ul>
<li>Under the EA there are two categories of Real Evidence identified.
<ul>
<li>-Exhibits (physical object tendered as evidence)</li>
<li>-Views (demonstrations, experiments or inspections of locations).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>EA makes it possible to adduce evidence other than through witness testimony or through documents - this includes physical, tangible objects such as the murder weapon. (s 52)</li>
<li>The other type of Real Evidence (generally referred to as Views) allows for the conduct of experiments, demonstrations and location inspections. (s53)</li>
<li>Demonstrations / experiments / inspections can be very powerful evidence so the Court needs to be satisfied that the evidence gained will assist the Court in its deliberations and will not be unfairly prejudicial to the parties (particularly to the Defendant in a Criminal matter).</li>
<li>Important to ensure procedural fairness is observed and that the evidence is able to be tested or commented upon like all other pieces of evidence.</li>
<li>Neither the Judge or any member of the Jury is permitted to conduct a View outside of the rules in s53 (Bilal Skaf‚Äôs case)</li>
<li>The factors that the Judge needs to consider when contemplating whether to conduct a View are set out in s53(3).</li>
<li>s53 does not apply to in-court demonstrations: Evans v The Queen (2007) 235 CLR 521
<ul>
<li>Under s54 the Court may draw any reasonable inference from what it sees, hears or otherwise notices during a demonstration, experiment or inspection.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Section 53 - Views
<ul>
<li>(1) A judge may, on application, order that a demonstration, experiment or inspection be held.</li>
<li>(2) A judge is not to make an order unless he or she is satisfied that:
<ul>
<li>(a) the parties will be given a reasonable opportunity to be present, and</li>
<li>(b) the judge and, if there is a jury, the jury will be present.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(3) Without limiting the matters that the judge may take into account in deciding whether to make an order, the judge is to take into account the following:
<ul>
<li>(a) whether the parties will be present,</li>
<li>(b) whether the demonstration, experiment or inspection will, in the court‚Äôs opinion, assist the court in resolving issues of fact or understanding the evidence,</li>
<li>(c) the danger that the demonstration, experiment or inspection might be unfairly prejudicial, might be misleading or confusing or might cause or result in undue waste of time,</li>
<li>(d) in the case of a demonstration‚Äîthe extent to which the demonstration will properly reproduce the conduct or event to be demonstrated,</li>
<li>(e) in the case of an inspection‚Äîthe extent to which the place or thing to be inspected has materially altered.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(4) The court (including, if there is a jury, the jury) is not to conduct an experiment in the course of its deliberations.</li>
<li>(5) This section does not apply in relation to the inspection of an exhibit by the court or, if there is a jury, by the jury.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Bilal Skaf Case
<ul>
<li>Note - The Court is not permitted to go outside the evidence presented and to act upon information privately obtained which the parties have no chance of combating or commenting upon.</li>
<li>In a Sexual Assault (Rape) case the Trial Judge gave his usual warning to the members of the Jury at the conclusion of the Trial. As part of this warning, the Judge instructed the Jury not to ‚Äúgo and do your own research‚Äù.</li>
<li>But despite the warning, the 64-year-old Jury Foreman rang another Juror the night before the verdict was delivered and they went to the park where the alleged rape occurred.</li>
<li>The two Jurors went to Gosling Park for about 20 minutes to check the lighting conditions (obviously an issue that had been causing some concern to the Jury).</li>
<li>At the Trial, the two Jurors had not told the Judge or anybody else what they had done.</li>
<li>At a BBQ some time later, the Foreman told a Solicitor that he and another had gone to the park. The Foreman said he only went to the park to `clarify something for my own mind‚Äô. Quite correctly, the Solicitor reported the conversation to the NSW Sheriff.</li>
<li>As a result, the matter went to Appeal and the Judges in the NSWCCA found the experiment was a miscarriage of justice.
<ul>
<li>‚ÄúIn our view there must, regrettably, be a new trial because of this ground,‚Äù the judges said.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>They also ordered that in future more specific orders be given to Juries to ensure further trials were not miscarried because of ‚ÄòJury misconduct‚Äô.</li>
<li>NSWCCA stated that orders should include:
<ul>
<li>not making private visits to the crime scene;</li>
<li>not asking other Jurors to conduct experiments; and</li>
<li>informing the Trial Judge if they discover fellow Jurors making independent inquiries into the case.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The NSWCCA decision to order a retrial led to the NSW Government to amend the Jury Act ‚Äì amendment allows for the punishment of those who conduct unauthorised experiments away from court.</li>

<li>R v L Cassar; R v E Sleiman (Judgment No 28) [1999] NSWSC 651
<ul>
<li>Court: Supreme Court of New South Wales</li>
<li>Judge: Sperling J</li>
<li>Parties: Regina v Leanne Cassar; Regina v Emad Sleiman</li>
<li>Key Issues:
<ul>
<li>The admissibility of secondary evidence, specifically a police running sheet, to prove the contents of a lost motel registration form.</li>
<li>Whether a witness could use a document prepared by another to refresh their memory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Decision:
<ul>
<li>The court held that the running sheet was admissible under section 48(4)(a) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) as a summary of the original document, which was unavailable.</li>
<li>The court granted leave for a police officer to use the running sheet to refresh his memory under section 32 of the Act, allowing him to provide oral evidence of the contents of the lost registration form.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Significance:
<ul>
<li>The case illustrates the application of sections 32 and 48 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) concerning the admissibility of secondary evidence and the conditions under which a witness can refresh their memory using documents not prepared by them.</li>

<li>Case Summary: Evans v The Queen [2007] HCA 59
<ul>
<li>Court: High Court of Australia</li>
<li>Judges: Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne, and Heydon JJ</li>
<li>Judgment Date: 13 December 2007</li>
<li>Parties: Evans (Appellant) v The Queen (Respondent)</li>
<li>Procedural History:
<ul>
<li>Evans was convicted of armed robbery in a lower court.</li>
<li>The conviction was based in part on an in-court demonstration where Evans was required to wear clothing similar to that worn by the offender and to speak words alleged to have been spoken during the robbery.</li>
<li>Evans appealed to the High Court, arguing that the demonstration was inadmissible due to its prejudicial nature.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Facts:
<ul>
<li>Evans was accused of an armed robbery where the offender was described as wearing overalls, a balaclava, and sunglasses.</li>
<li>During the trial, the prosecution had Evans wear similar clothing and speak specific words in front of the jury to compare with witness descriptions.</li>
<li>The defense argued that this demonstration was prejudicial and did not have sufficient probative value.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Legal Issue:
<ul>
<li>Whether the in-court demonstration was admissible, considering the balance between its probative value and potential prejudice to the accused.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Decision:
<ul>
<li>The High Court upheld the admissibility of the in-court demonstration.</li>
<li>The Court found the demonstration relevant and useful for the jury in assessing the identity of the offender.</li>
<li>The probative value of the evidence was deemed to outweigh any potential for unfair prejudice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ratio Decidendi:
<ul>
<li>The admissibility of in-court demonstrations depends on the discretion of the judge, who must weigh the probative value of the evidence against the risk of prejudice.</li>
<li>In this case, the demonstration was relevant to the key issue of identity, and its potential prejudicial effect was not sufficient to exclude it from evidence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Significance:
<ul>
<li>Evans v The Queen is an important case in evidence law, setting a precedent for the admissibility of in-court demonstrations.</li>
<li>It highlights the need for careful judicial balancing between the probative value of evidence and the risk of unfair prejudice to ensure a fair trial.</li>
<li>This case is often referenced in legal discussions concerning the limits and conditions for admitting similar in-court evidence.</li>

<li>R v Khan NSWSC 1995
<ul>
<li>Court: Supreme Court of New South Wales</li>
<li>Parties:
<ul>
<li>Prosecution: Regina (The Crown)</li>
<li>Defendant: Gulam Mohammad Khan</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Procedural History:
<ul>
<li>Gulam Mohammad Khan was on trial for the murder of Mohammad Abbas.</li>
<li>The Crown sought to compel Mr. Khan‚Äôs wife, Jatun Bibi Khan, to testify against her husband.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Original Dispute:
<ul>
<li>The dispute originated from the events of 4 December 1993, when Gulam Mohammad Khan allegedly murdered Mohammad Abbas, who had been living with the Khan family.</li>
<li>The prosecution aimed to call Mrs. Khan as a witness to testify about her relationship with Abbas and the circumstances surrounding the murder.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reason for Trial:
<ul>
<li>The trial was convened to determine Mr. Khan‚Äôs guilt in the murder of Mohammad Abbas, with the Crown seeking to establish that the killing was not the result of a sudden loss of self-control (provocation) but rather a premeditated act of revenge.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Material Facts:
<ul>
<li>Mohammad Abbas, a friend of the Khan family, had been living with them for some time. During Mr. Khan‚Äôs absence in Fiji, Mrs. Khan‚Äôs relationship with Abbas grew closer, and they became sexually involved shortly before the murder.</li>
<li>On the night of the murder, Mr. Khan allegedly caught them together and, in a fit of rage, stabbed Abbas multiple times. Mrs. Khan‚Äôs initial statement to the police implicated her husband, but she later indicated that she would retract some of that statement if called to testify, claiming that her involvement with Abbas was coerced.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Issue Raised:
<ul>
<li>The central issue was whether the court should compel Mrs. Khan to testify against her husband despite her objection, balancing the harm that might be caused to the marital relationship against the need for her testimony in the interests of justice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Law(s)/Statute(s) in Contention:
<ul>
<li>Section 18 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW):
<ul>
<li>This section allows a court to compel a witness, including a spouse, to testify even if they object, provided that the court determines the necessity of the evidence outweighs any potential harm to the witness or their relationship with the defendant.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Section 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW):
<ul>
<li>This section provides the court with discretion to exclude evidence if its probative value is outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice to the defendant.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Precedences:
<ul>
<li>Richardson v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 116: The Crown referenced this case in arguing that Mrs. Khan‚Äôs prior statement to the police could be used as evidence, even if she recanted it during her testimony.</li>
<li>R v Blewitt (1988) 62 ALR 503: This case was cited regarding the admissibility of prior statements when a witness deviates from their earlier testimony.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tests:
<ul>
<li>The court applied the balancing test outlined in section 18(6) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), considering the potential harm to Mrs. Khan and her marital relationship against the importance of her testimony to the Crown‚Äôs case.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Words and Phrases Considered:
<ul>
<li>‚ÄúProvocation‚Äù: The defense centered on whether Mr. Khan acted under sudden provocation upon discovering his wife with Abbas, which could reduce his culpability from murder to manslaughter.</li>
<li>‚ÄúHarm to relationship‚Äù: The court considered the nature of the harm that compelling Mrs. Khan to testify might cause to her marital relationship.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Arguments by Party:
<ul>
<li>Prosecution: Argued that Mrs. Khan‚Äôs testimony was crucial to establishing the sequence of events leading to Abbas‚Äôs death, particularly to counter the defense‚Äôs claim of provocation.
<ul>
<li>The Crown also contended that Mrs. Khan‚Äôs initial police statement could be treated as evidence under the new Evidence Act, even if she retracted it on the stand.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Defense: Argued that compelling Mrs. Khan to testify would cause significant harm to her marital relationship, which still endured despite the charges.
<ul>
<li>The defense also suggested that her testimony would lack credibility and that its key points could be corroborated by other evidence, making it unnecessary to compel her testimony.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Judicial Opinions:
<ul>
<li>The court, presided over by Justice Abadee, weighed the arguments presented by both parties.</li>
<li>Justice Abadee acknowledged the potential importance of Mrs. Khan‚Äôs testimony but ultimately decided that the harm to her relationship with her husband outweighed the benefits of compelling her testimony.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Legal Reasoning:
<ul>
<li>The court reasoned that although Mrs. Khan‚Äôs testimony could be relevant to the issue of provocation, the potential harm to the marital relationship was significant.</li>
<li>The court also noted that much of the evidence Mrs. Khan could provide was available from other sources, including the defendant‚Äôs own statements to the police and other witnesses.</li>
<li>Therefore, the court chose not to compel Mrs. Khan to testify, as the damage to the marriage outweighed the evidentiary value her testimony might provide.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ratio Decidendi:
<ul>
<li>The court‚Äôs decision was based on the principle that the harm likely to be caused to Mrs. Khan‚Äôs marital relationship by compelling her to testify outweighed the desirability of having her evidence presented in court.</li>
<li>The ruling emphasized the court‚Äôs discretion under section 18 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), prioritizing the protection of personal relationships where the evidentiary value does not justify the potential harm.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Result:
<ul>
<li>The court ruled that Mrs. Khan would not be compelled to testify against her husband, and her prior statement to the police was not admitted as evidence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Relevance to Modern Law:
<ul>
<li>This case remains relevant in discussions about the limits of compelling testimony from unwilling witnesses, especially within family contexts.</li>
<li>It highlights the judiciary‚Äôs role in safeguarding personal relationships from undue harm during legal proceedings and serves as a precedent for similar cases involving the compellability of spousal testimony.</li>

<ul>
<li>Witness Competence &amp; Compellability

<li>Who can give evidence ?</li>
<li>Who must give evidence ?</li>
<li>Evidence ‚Äì Sworn / Affirmed / Unsworn</li>
<li>Child Witness</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Who can give evidence ?
<ul>
<li>The legal ability to give evidence is referred to as ‚ÄòCompetence‚Äô.</li>
<li>Competence def = ability to give a rational reply to questions about facts.</li>
<li>Except as otherwise provided by the Evidence Act:
<ul>
<li>every person is presumed to be ‚Äòcompetent‚Äô to give evidence unless some form of exception applies. (s12(a) EA)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Exceptions to the presumption:
<ul>
<li>Those lacking capacity to give evidence about a fact owing to a mental, intellectual or physical disability. (s13 EA)</li>
<li>The Accused is not competent to give evidence for Prosecution. (s17(2) refers)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Section 13 Competence: lack of capacity
<ul>
<li>(1) A person is not competent to give evidence about a fact if, for any reason (including mental, intellectual or physical disability):
<ul>
<li>a. the person does not have the capacity to understand a question about the fact, or</li>
<li>b. the person does not have the capacity to give an answer that can be understood in relation to a question about the fact.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>and that incapacity cannot be overcome (see ss 30 &amp; 31)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Who must give evidence?
<ul>
<li>A person who is competent to give evidence about a fact is compellable to give that evidence. (s12(b) EA)</li>
<li>If a person is a compellable Witness, they may be legally forced to give evidence despite being reluctant to do so.</li>
<li>Various exceptions to compellability may apply:
<ul>
<li>The Accused in his own Trial - s17(1)</li>
<li>Co-Accused (if not given separate Trial) ‚Äì s17(3)</li>
<li>Sovereign / Governor-General / Governor ‚Äì s15(1)</li>
<li>Members of Parliament (if sitting) ‚Äì s15(2)</li>
<li>Close relatives of the Accused (eg. Spouse) ‚Äì s18 &amp; s19*</li>
<li>Judges / Jurors (in trial in which they were acting) ‚Äì s16</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Compellability ‚Äì Close Relatives
<ul>
<li>In criminal proceedings a close relative of A may object to being compelled to give evidence for P (s18 EA).
<ul>
<li>See s18(2) for classification of ‚Äòclose relative‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If there is an objection, the W must not give evidence if the Court finds that:
<ul>
<li>a) There is a likelihood of harm to either W or the relationship; and</li>
<li>b) The nature / extent of the harm outweighs the desirability of having the evidence (s18(6) refers).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When undertaking this balancing exercise, the Court is to have regard to the matters set out in s18(7).</li>
<li>*** s18 does not apply in relation to certain offences in relation to children (see s19 EA)</li>
<li>s18(7) Without limiting the matters that may be taken into account by the court for the purposes of subsection (6), it must take into account the following:
<ul>
<li>(a) the nature and gravity of the offence for which the defendant is being prosecuted,</li>
<li>(b) the substance and importance of any evidence that the person might give and the weight that is likely to be attached to it,</li>
<li>(c) whether any other evidence concerning the matters to which the evidence of the person would relate is reasonably available to the prosecutor,</li>
<li>(d) the nature of the relationship between the defendant and the person,</li>
<li>(e) whether, in giving the evidence, the person would have to disclose matter that was received by the person in confidence from the defendant.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Evidence ‚Äì Sworn / Affirmed / Unsworn
<ul>
<li>Sworn Evidence
<ul>
<li>A Witness who is competent to give evidence is required to give ‚Äòsworn‚Äô evidence.</li>
<li>Before giving evidence, the Witness must take an ‚ÄòOath‚Äô or make an ‚ÄòAffirmation‚Äô that they will tell the truth (s21 EA).
<ul>
<li>I swear by Almighty God that the evidence I shall give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.</li>
<li>I solemnly and sincerely declare and affirm that the evidence I shall give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Section 21 - Sworn evidence to be on oath or affirmation
<ul>
<li>(1) A witness in a proceeding must either take an oath, or make an affirmation, before giving evidence.</li>
<li>(2) Subsection (1) does not apply to a person who gives unsworn evidence under section 13.</li>
<li>(3) A person who is called merely to produce a document or thing to the court need not take an oath or make an affirmation before doing so.</li>
<li>(4) The witness is to take the oath, or make the affirmation, in accordance with the appropriate form in Schedule 1 or in a similar form.</li>
<li>(5) Such an affirmation has the same effect for all purposes as an oath.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Evidence ‚Äì Sworn / Unsworn
<ul>
<li>Unsworn Evidence
<ul>
<li>Despite the fact that W may be able give a coherent / comprehensible answer to a question, there may be an issue regarding W‚Äôs ability to understand their obligation to tell the truth.
<ul>
<li>In this situation W is unable to give sworn evidence under s13(3). However, in certain circumstances W may still be able to give unsworn evidence.</li>

<li>Section 13 Competence: lack of capacity
<ul>
<li>(3) A person who is competent to give evidence about a fact is not competent to give sworn evidence about the fact if the person does not have the capacity to understand that, in giving evidence, he or she is under an obligation to give truthful evidence.</li>
<li>(4) A person who is not competent to give sworn evidence about a fact may, subject to subsection</li>
<li>(5), be competent to give unsworn evidence about the fact.
<ul>
<li>(5) A person who, because of subsection (3), is not competent to give sworn evidence is competent to give unsworn evidence if the court has told the person:
<ul>
<li>(a) That it is important to tell the truth, and</li>
<li>(b) That he or she may be asked question that he or she does not know, or cannot remember, the answer to, and that he or she should tell the court if this occurs, and</li>
<li>(c) That he or she may be asked questions that suggest certain statements are true or untrue and that he or she should agree with the statements that he or she believes are true and should feel no pressure to agree with statements that he or she believes are untrue. [‚Ä¶]</li>

<li>Child Witness
<ul>
<li>CL traditionally regarded children as an unreliable class of witness, requiring that trial judges warn juries that it is dangerous to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of a child - perception being that children are prone to fantasy, highly suggestible, and likely to give inaccurate accounts of events</li>
<li>This position is no longer the case - research conducted in recent years demonstrates that children‚Äôs cognitive and recall skills are not inherently less reliable than that of adults.</li>
<li>In EA, the guidance relating to judicial warnings with respect to the evidence given by a Child Witness reflects current research</li>
<li>The EA now contains the following provisions in relation to judicial warnings and child witnesses:
<ul>
<li>‚Äìs 165(6) provides that warnings in relation to the reliability of a child‚Äôs evidence can only be given in accordance withs 165A.</li>
<li>‚Äìs 165A prohibits trial judges from warning or suggesting to juries that children (as a class) are unreliable witnesses or that it is generally dangerous to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of any child witness.</li>

<li>How is evidence adduced ?
<ul>
<li>Testimonial Evidence may be given orally or in written form (Affidavit or Witness Statement)</li>
<li>Documents and Real Evidence are tendered and if they conform to the Rules governing relevance and authenticity they will be admitted into evidence.</li>
<li>Before evidence will be accepted, there must be a basis for finding that the evidence is what it purports to be.
<ul>
<li>Very important requirement for Documentary Evidence, Real Evidence and Expert Evidence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Court must not use information that was not part of the formal process of receiving evidence (Bilal Skaf case ‚Äì Jurors undertaking ‚Äòunofficial‚Äô view)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Questioning Witnesses
<ul>
<li>Control of Examination by the Court
<ul>
<li>s 26 Court‚Äôs control over questioning of witnesses</li>
<li>The court may make such orders as it considers just in relation to:
<ul>
<li>(a) the way in which witnesses are to be questioned, and</li>
<li>(b) the production and use of documents and things in connection with the questioning of witnesses, and</li>
<li>(c) the order in which parties may question a witness, and</li>
<li>(d) the presence and behaviour of any person in connection with the questioning of witnesses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>s29 Manner and form of questioning witnesses and their responses
<ul>
<li>(1) A party may question a witness in any way the party thinks fit, except as provided by this Chapter or as directed by the court.</li>
<li>(2) A court may, on its own motion or on the application of the party that called the witness, direct that the witness give evidence wholly or partly in narrative form.</li>
<li>(3) Such a direction may include directions about the way in which evidence is to be given in that form.</li>
<li>(4) Evidence may be given in the form of charts, summaries or other explanatory material if it appears to the court that the material would be likely to aid its comprehension of other evidence that has been given or is to be given.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adducing &amp; Testing Testimonial Evidence
<ul>
<li>Three stage process used by Counsel (Lawyer) to adduce and test evidence:
<ul>
<li>Examination-in-Chief</li>
<li>Cross-Examination</li>
<li>Re-Examination</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Party who calls the Witness will commence by taking the Witness through his / her Evidence-in-Chief. (Non-leading questions)</li>
<li>The Opposing Party will test the evidence of Witness hoping to undermine it or bolster his / her own case. (Leading questions)</li>
<li>If need be, the first Party may re-examine the Witness in order to explain any points of confusion or unfavourable evidence. (Non-leading questions)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>s 39 Limits on re-examination
<ul>
<li>On re-examination:
<ul>
<li>(a) a witness may be questioned about matters arising out of evidence given by the witness in cross-examination, and</li>
<li>(a) other questions may not be put to the witness unless the court grants leave (permission) to do so (Leave ‚Äì s192 EA).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Leading Questions
<ul>
<li>A Leading Question is a question asked of a Witness that:
<ul>
<li>directly or indirectly suggests a particular answer to the question, or assumes the existence of a fact the existence of which is in dispute in the proceeding and as to the existence of which the witness has not given evidence before the question is asked.</li>
<li>(EA Dictionary: Part 1 ‚Äì Definitions)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Questioning Examples
<ul>
<li>Non-leading
<ul>
<li>‚Äì When was the last time you saw the woman ?</li>
<li>‚Äì How tall was the man that you saw ?</li>
<li>‚Äì What happened when you entered the bank?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Leading
<ul>
<li>‚Äì The last time you saw the woman was about noon?</li>
<li>‚Äì The man was approx 180cm tall, wasn‚Äôt he ?</li>
<li>‚Äì Is it true that when you entered the bank, a shot was fired by the Accused ?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>s 42 Leading Questions
<ul>
<li>A party may ask a leading question of a witness in cross-examination unless the court disallows the question or directs the witness not to answer it. (s 42(1) refers).</li>
<li>When deciding whether to disallow the question, or give such a direction not to answer in accordance with s 42, the court may take into account the extent to which:
<ul>
<li>(a) the evidence given by the witness in examination-in-chief is unfavourable to the party who called the witness, and</li>
<li>(b) the witness has an interest that is consistent with an interest of the cross-examiner, and</li>
<li>(c) the witness is sympathetic to the party conducting the cross-examination, either generally or about a particular matter, and</li>
<li>(d) the witness‚Äôs age, or any mental, intellectual or physical disability to which the witness is subject, may affect the witness‚Äôs answers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The factors in s 42(2)(a)-(c) allow a judge to disallow a question where there are reasons to believe that the witness is favourably inclined to the cross-examining party.</li>
<li>Arguably, s 42(2)(c) suggests that a question should be disallowed where there is a danger that the witness is unusually susceptible to suggestive questioning making the evidence unreliable.</li>
<li>Pursuant to s 42(3), the court is to disallow the question, or direct the witness not to answer it, if it is satisfied that the facts concerned would be better ascertained if leading questions were not used.</li>
<li>Should be noted that s 42 does not limit the court‚Äôs power to control leading questions (s 42(4) refers).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Rule in Browne v Dunn
<ul>
<li>An essential aspect of fairness in court process is ensuring that one party has the opportunity to answer the claims or allegations of another.
<ul>
<li>The opposing party must be put on notice of the case that they must answer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To address this, the Rule in Browne v Dunn was developed which requires a cross-examining party that intends to contradict a witness by adducing other evidence, to put as much of their own case that concerns that witness to them, and if it is intended to suggest that a witness is not speaking the truth on a particular matter, that their attention is drawn to what will be suggested about it so that they might have an opportunity to explain.</li>
<li>Browne and Dunn is not a rule of evidence - it is a rule of procedural fairness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rule in Browne v Dunn
<ul>
<li>When W is giving evidence and you intend to call evidence that contradicts them, you must put the substance of that contradictory evidence to the witness during cross-examination and give them the opportunity to comment on it.</li>
<li>Unfair to deny W the opportunity of explaining a point that will later be used to invite criticism or disbelief in their evidence</li>
<li>Duty for parties to ‚Äòput‚Äô to W any matter that may be used to suggest their evidence is untruthful, unreliable or which contradicts their testimony</li>
<li>Can be done in a formal manner ‚ÄòI put it to you that‚Ä¶‚Äô or it may be done in a more natural, conversational style as part of the general cross examination, such as ‚ÄòIsn‚Äôt it true that‚Ä¶‚Äô</li>
<li>Failure to observe may result in adverse consequences eg recall W, exclude evidence, jury direction, dismiss jury</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Rule in Browne v Dunn
<ul>
<li>If the Rule in Browne v Dunn is not observed, there are several different ways that the Court can deal with the issue:
<ul>
<li>‚Äì Prevent non-compliant party from submitting that opponent‚Äôs evidence should not be believed.</li>
<li>‚Äì Exclude evidence given by a non-compliant party.</li>
<li>‚Äì Recall Witness: s 46</li>
<li>‚Äì Allow cross-examination of non-compliant party</li>
<li>‚Äì Comment on non-compliance; lesser weight given to their evidence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Marelic v Comcare [1993] FCA 599 provides a good overview of how the Rule in Browne v Dunn should be applied.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reviving Memory
<ul>
<li>A witness must not, in the course of giving evidence, use a document to try to revive his or her memory about a fact or opinion unless the court gives leave (s 42).</li>
<li>Despites 42, in any criminal proceeding, a police officer may give evidence-in-chief for the prosecution by reading or being led through a written statement previously made by the police officer (s 43).</li>
<li>If a witness attempts to revive his / her memory ‚Äòout of court‚Äô, the court may, on the request of a party, give directions that the documents / things used by the witness to revive his or her memory are produced to the party (s 44).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>s 48 Unfavourable Witnesses
<ul>
<li>(1) A party who called a witness may, with the leave of the court, question the witness as though the party were cross-examining the witness, about:
<ul>
<li>(a) evidence given by the witness that is unfavourable to the party, or</li>
<li>(b) a matter of which the witness may reasonably be supposed to have knowledge and about which it appears to the court the witness is not, in examination in chief, making a genuine attempt to give evidence, or</li>
<li>(c) whether the witness has, at any time, made a prior inconsistent statement. [‚Ä¶]</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>s 41 - Improper Questions
<ul>
<li>The court must disallow a question put to a witness in cross-examination, or inform the witness that it need not be answered, if the court is of the opinion that the question is:
<ul>
<li>‚Äì Misleading, confusing, unduly annoying, harassing intimidating, offensive, oppressive, humiliating, repetitive.</li>
<li>‚Äì In a tone that is belittling, insulting, otherwise inappropriate.</li>
<li>‚Äì Has no basis other than a stereotype (sex, race, culture, ethnicity, age, mental, intellectual or physical disability)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>s 43 Prior Inconsistent Statements of Witnesses
<ul>
<li>(1) A witness may be cross-examined about a prior inconsistent statement alleged to have been made by the witness‚Ä¶</li>
<li>(2) If, in cross-examination, a witness does not admit that he or she has made a prior inconsistent statement, the cross-examiner is not to adduce evidence of the statement otherwise than from the witness unless, in the cross-examination, the cross-examiner:
<ul>
<li>(a) informed the witness of enough of the circumstances of the making of the statement to enable the witness to identify the statement, and</li>
<li>(b) drew the witness‚Äôs attention to so much of the statement as is inconsistent with the witness‚Äôs evidence</li>

<li>R v Glasby [2000] NSWCCA 83 (22 June 2000)
<ul>
<li>Procedural History:
<ul>
<li>Garry Zane Glasby was convicted of murder in the Supreme Court of New South Wales on 11 June 1998.</li>
<li>He was sentenced to life imprisonment.</li>
<li>Glasby appealed both his conviction and sentence to the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal (NSWCCA) on several grounds, including the admissibility of his wife‚Äôs testimony, errors in jury directions, and the severity of his sentence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Original Dispute:
<ul>
<li>The dispute arose from the murder of John Albert Thiessl, allegedly carried out by Garry Zane Glasby on 6 November 1994 as part of a contract killing arranged by the victim‚Äôs wife, Carmela Thiessl.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reason for Trial:
<ul>
<li>Glasby was tried for the murder of John Albert Thiessl.</li>
<li>The Crown‚Äôs case was that the murder was premeditated and carried out for financial gain.</li>
<li>Glasby pleaded not guilty, claiming he had no involvement in the murder.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Material Facts:
<ul>
<li>The Crown alleged that Carmela Thiessl contracted Glasby to kill her husband in exchange for a substantial sum of money.</li>
<li>Mrs. Suzette Glasby, the appellant‚Äôs wife, was involved in luring the victim to his death and driving Glasby from the scene of the crime.</li>
<li>Evidence against Glasby included testimony from Mrs. Glasby, recorded conversations implying Glasby‚Äôs involvement, and circumstantial evidence linking him to the crime.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Issue Raised:
<ul>
<li>Whether the trial judge erred in compelling Mrs. Glasby to testify and allowing her cross-examination under s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995.</li>
<li>Whether the trial judge adequately instructed the jury on the use of hearsay evidence provided by Mrs. Glasby.</li>
<li>Whether the trial judge should have discharged the jury due to prejudicial comments made by Mrs. Glasby.</li>
<li>Whether the life sentence imposed on Glasby was manifestly excessive compared to the sentence imposed on Mrs. Glasby.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Law(s)/Statute(s) in Contention:
<ul>
<li>Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) ‚Äì particularly ss 18, 38, and 60 (relating to compellability of witnesses, cross-examination, and hearsay).</li>
<li>Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 6(1) ‚Äì regarding the application of the proviso in appeals.</li>
<li>Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 19A ‚Äì relating to the imposition of life imprisonment for murder.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Precedences:
<ul>
<li>Lee v The Queen (1998) 195 CLR 594: Clarified the application of s 60 of the Evidence Act 1995, specifically regarding hearsay evidence.</li>
<li>Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465: Set out principles for imposing the maximum penalty, even in cases where worse examples of the crime might be conceivable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tests:
<ul>
<li>Test for Compellability under s 18 of the Evidence Act 1995: Whether a witness is compellable depends on factors like the likelihood of harm to the relationship and the balance of fairness.</li>
<li>Application of the Proviso in Criminal Appeals (s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act): Whether the error denied the accused a fair chance of acquittal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Words and Phrases Considered:
<ul>
<li>‚ÄúCompellable witness‚Äù ‚Äì the statutory ability to require a spouse to testify, subject to certain conditions.</li>
<li>‚ÄúHearsay‚Äù ‚Äì the legal rule regarding the admissibility of out-of-court statements to prove the truth of the matters asserted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Arguments by Party:
<ul>
<li>Appellant (Glasby): Argued that his wife should not have been compelled to testify against him, that the trial judge failed to direct the jury correctly regarding hearsay evidence, and that the jury should have been discharged after Mrs. Glasby‚Äôs prejudicial outbursts. He also argued that his life sentence was excessive compared to the sentence imposed on his wife.</li>
<li>Respondent (Crown): Defended the compellability of Mrs. Glasby under the Evidence Act 1995, justified the cross-examination under s 38, and argued that any trial errors were not fundamental and did not deny Glasby a fair trial. The Crown also defended the life sentence as appropriate given the gravity of the offence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Judicial Opinions:
<ul>
<li>The judges concurred that Mrs. Glasby was a compellable witness and that her cross-examination was properly allowed. They acknowledged an error in jury directions regarding hearsay but concluded that the error did not result in a miscarriage of justice.</li>
<li>The life sentence was deemed appropriate, and the disparity with Mrs. Glasby‚Äôs sentence was justified based on their respective roles in the crime.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Legal Reasoning:
<ul>
<li>The Court determined that s 18 of the Evidence Act 1995 applied retrospectively and that the trial judge properly exercised discretion in requiring Mrs. Glasby to testify.</li>
<li>Regarding the hearsay issue, the Court accepted that the trial judge had not provided adequate directions to the jury, but the weight of other evidence meant that this error did not deny Glasby a fair trial.</li>
<li>The Court also found that the trial judge‚Äôs refusal to discharge the jury was appropriate, given the instructions to disregard the prejudicial comments.</li>
<li>The life sentence was upheld as proportionate to Glasby‚Äôs culpability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ratio Decidendi:
<ul>
<li>Mrs. Glasby was a compellable witness under the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), and the trial judge‚Äôs errors in jury directions did not amount to a miscarriage of justice due to the strength of the evidence against Glasby.</li>
<li>The life sentence was appropriate given the premeditated nature of the crime and Glasby‚Äôs dominant role.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Result:
<ul>
<li>The appeal against conviction and sentence was dismissed.</li>
<li>Glasby‚Äôs conviction for murder and life sentence were upheld by the Court.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Relevance to Modern Law:
<ul>
<li>This case highlights the application of the Evidence Act 1995 in compelling spousal testimony and underscores the impact of Lee v The Queen on the treatment of hearsay evidence in criminal trials. It reinforces the principle that errors in jury directions may not warrant overturning a conviction if the evidence against the accused is overwhelming.</li>
<li>It also illustrates the court‚Äôs discretion in balancing issues of parity in sentencing between co-offenders.</li>

<li>Lecture 3A: Calling Witnesses
<ul>
<li>Witnesses
<ul>
<li>One of the main ways that we still adduce evidence in Court is through the calling and questioning of Witness.</li>
<li>Need to have an understanding of relevant provisions and case law relating to:
<ul>
<li>Calling Witnesses</li>
<li>Effect of not calling evidence</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Failure to Give or Call Evidence
<ul>
<li>How does the law address the fact that a party fails to call evidence that the party would reasonably be expected to ?</li>
<li>How does the law address the situation where the Defendant elects to remain silent at trial ?  (This question will be addressed in the next lecture ‚Äì s20 EA Silence at Trial)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Calling Witnesses
<ul>
<li>In a trial, who is responsible for deciding what witnesses will called and by whom ??
<ul>
<li>General principle is that given our adversarial system, it is the parties to the litigation who decide what witnesses are to be called and in what order.
<ul>
<li>This can have a major impact on how a witness may be questioned.</li>
<li>Can give a huge tactical advantage to one party over another due to limits placed on the manner in which questions can be posed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The question in criminal matters is who is responsible for deciding who is to be called as a Crown witness ??
<ul>
<li>Need to be aware of duties and role of Prosecutor.  See Prosecutor‚Äôs Duties as set out in Rule 29 Legal Profession Uniform Law Australian Solicitors‚Äô Conduct Rules 2015 [NSW] <a href="https://legislation.nsw.gov.au/view/html/inforce/current/sl-2015-0244#sec.29" class="external">https://legislation.nsw.gov.au/view/html/inforce/current/sl-2015-0244#sec.29<svg aria-hidden="true" class="external-icon" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M320 0H288V64h32 82.7L201.4 265.4 178.7 288 224 333.3l22.6-22.6L448 109.3V192v32h64V192 32 0H480 320zM32 32H0V64 480v32H32 456h32V480 352 320H424v32 96H64V96h96 32V32H160 32z"></path></svg></a>
<ul>
<li>Must call evidence that may assist court, even if not helpful to case</li>

<li>R v Apostilides (1984) 154 CLR 563
<ul>
<li>Apostilides was tried and convicted on four counts of rape.
<ul>
<li>At trial P failed to call 2 witness ‚Äì these witnesses were called by D and cross examined by P (NOT FAVORABLE AT ALL - CAN‚ÄôT CROSS).</li>
<li>Apostilides appealed on basis that the P should have called the witnesses so D could cross examine them (argued miscarriage of justice).</li>
<li>Appeal upheld by VSC ‚Äì retrial ordered (Crown then appealed the VSC decision in HCA)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As part Special Leave Application, HCA set out various propositions including:
<ul>
<li>The Prosecutor alone bears the responsibility of deciding whether a person will be called as a witness for the Crown.</li>
<li>A decision of the Prosecutor not to call a particular person as a witness will only constitute a ground for setting aside a conviction if, when viewed against the conduct of the trial taken as a whole, it is seen to give rise to a miscarriage of justice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>R v Kneebone (1999) 47 NSWLR 450
<ul>
<li>Another case where the Crown failed to call a Witness is the case of Kneebone.</li>
<li>Kneebone is authority for the principle that the Crown must meet the obligations that were identified in Apostilides because the Prosecutor is obliged to present the case fairly. This is an important part of the Duties of the Prosecutor.</li>
<li>Case identifies that although we have an adversarial system of justice, the Prosecutor continues to have an obligation to ensure that a prosecution proceeds fairly.
<ul>
<li>Question of fairness and balance on part of Prosecutor ‚Äì See also Whitehorn v The Queen (1983) 152 CLR 657 (Deane, J. at 663-664)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Crown Prosecutor bears responsibility for deciding whether to call a witness for the Crown.</li>
<li>Judge may, but not obliged to question Crown regarding reasons not to call a witness. Not called to adjudicate sufficiency of those reasons.</li>
<li>At the close of the Crown case, Judge may ask Crown to reconsider the decision, but cannot compel the Crown to call a witness.</li>
<li>Judge may comment to jury about failure of Crown to call a witness and the effect on the trial (but also now see Dyers v The Queen).</li>
<li>Save for exceptional circumstances, judge should not call a witness.</li>
<li>Decision not to call a witness is only a ground to set aside a conviction if, when viewed against conduct of whole trial, it gives rise to a miscarriage of justice.</li>
</ul>

<li>Can the Judge Call a Witness?

<li>The issue of whether a Judge can a call a witness was examined in  Apostilides where one of the propositions identified by the HCA was that only in extraordinary circumstances should the Judge call a witness on his / her own volition.
<ul>
<li>In an adversarial system of litigation, the dispute is supposed to be run by the disputing parties; the judge is not supposed to intervene in the conduct of their cases. However, if the Judge feels that there may be a miscarriage of justice, the Judge is permitted to call a witness (only in extraordinary circumstances).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The authority for the kind of extraordinary circumstances contemplated by the HCA comes from the decision in R v Damic [1982] 2 NSWLR 750.</li>
<li>R v Damic [1982] 2 NSWLR 750
<ul>
<li>Damic was a self-represented litigant who had been charged with many offences, including murder.</li>
<li>Trial Judge thought Damic was fundamentally incapable of leading a proper defence (serious mental illness). Damic refused to raise mental illness as his defence ‚Äì Judge considered that this did not accord to the principles of a fair trial.</li>
<li>Trial Judge called a psychiatrist to assess the fitness of Damic to represent himself, and the psychiatrist was then called as a witness to testify about the Damic‚Äôs fitness. Had the judge not called that witness, and had Damic been convicted, the conviction would have been unfair and vulnerable to being overturned on appeal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Failure to Call a Witness
<ul>
<li>How does the law address the fact that a party fails to call evidence (witness) that the party would reasonably be expected to ?
<ul>
<li>The rule in Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298 relates to civil cases where the Plaintiff does not call a witness that they would reasonably be expected to have called ‚Äì as a result the Trial Judge may draw an adverse inference from that failure.  (Note that s20 EA only applies to criminal matters)</li>
<li>The principle in Jones v Dunkel was originally extended to apply in criminal cases ‚Äì this position is no longer valid in criminal matters.</li>
<li>The application of Jones v Dunkel in criminal matters has been repeatedly overruled, most conclusively in the HCA decision in  Dyers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298 (CIVIL)
<ul>
<li>Although Jones v Dunkel was a civil matter in relation to a fatal road accident where the driver of the defendant‚Äôs truck was not called to give evidence and does not directly deal with the issue of the accused‚Äôs right to silence at trial, per se, the HCA decision in this matter has been cited as an authority for the proposition that in certain circumstances an inference can be drawn from a party‚Äôs failure to give or call evidence.</li>
<li>The Jones v Dunkel principle says that if a party would normally be expected to call a witness, or adduce other evidence, and they choose not to call that witness / adduce that evidence, in the absence of an explanation for failure to call the witness, a court might be entitled to conclude / infer that the evidence of that witness would not have assisted the party.</li>
<li>In light of the wording of s20 and a several HCA decisions such as Dyers v The Queen, Jones v Dunkel does not have any real application in criminal matters.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Failure to Call Evidence
<ul>
<li>How does the law address the fact that the Defence fails to call evidence (witness) that the Defence would reasonably be expected to have called ?
<ul>
<li>Following the HCA decision in Dyers v The Queen, no comment should be made about the failure of the Defence to call a witness who might have been able to assist the Defence case.</li>
<li>Only comment that can be made is that the jury should not speculate about what the witness might have said, if he / she had been called (Dyers v The Queen [15] refers)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A similar approach is taken with respect to the Accused making the election not to give evidence on his / her own behalf.</li>
<li>How does the law address the fact that the Crown fails to call evidence that the Crown would reasonably be expected to have called ?
<ul>
<li>Following decisions such as RPS v The Queen [2000] HCA 3, Dyers v The Queen [2002] HCA 45,  Mahmood v WA (2008) 232 CLR 397 and R v Louizos [2009] NSWCCA 71 the position is that where the P has failed to call a witness (who might have been expected to be called by the P), the jury may properly reach conclusions that the failure may help support a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused.</li>
<li>As per Criminal Trial Courts Bench Book (NSW)
<ul>
<li>‚Ä¶ a jury is entitled to take into account that there was no evidence from a particular person in deciding whether or not there is a reasonable doubt about the accused‚Äôs guilt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How does the law address the fact that the Crown fails to call evidence that the Crown would reasonably be expected to have called ?
<ul>
<li>Mahmood v WA (2008) 232 CLR 397, is authority for the proposition that ‚Äù‚Ä¶ where a witness, who might have been expected to be called and to give evidence on a matter, is not called by the prosecution, the question is not whether the jury may properly reach conclusions about issues of fact but whether, in the circumstances, they should entertain a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused.‚Äù</li>
<li>In R v Louizos [2009] NSWCCA 71 it was held that  ‚Äù‚Ä¶ it may have been appropriate for the Trial Judge to raise with the jury whether the failure of the Crown to call the witness gave rise to a reasonable doubt about the truthfulness and reliability of the evidence‚Ä¶ but he was never asked to do so.‚Äù [57]</li>

<ul>
<li>The Menu
<ul>
<li>The Right to Silence</li>
<li>Silence of the Accused Pre-Trial</li>
<li>Silence of the Accused at Trial</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Right to Silence
<ul>
<li>Right to Silence is a legal protection given to people undergoing police interrogation or at Trial.</li>
<li>Right is linked with principles that Prosecution bears Burden of Proof and that the Accused is not a compellable witness in his / her own Trial.</li>
<li>Right covers a number of issues centered around the right to refuse to answer questions ‚Äì usually relates to avoidance of self-incrimination.</li>
<li>Right usually includes the provision that adverse comments or inferences cannot be made by the Judge or Jury about the refusal to answer questions before or during a Trial.</li>
<li>Right extends from the moment of arrest to the end of the Trial.</li>
<li>Different rules apply in relation to Pre-Trial Silence and Silence at Trial</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pre-Trial Silence
<ul>
<li>Evidence of Silence (s89 &amp; s89A)
<ul>
<li>In a Criminal proceeding, s89 provides that subject to the special requirements set out in s89A, an unfavourable inference must not be drawn from evidence that a person failed or refused:
<ul>
<li>to answer one or more questions, or</li>
<li>to respond to a representation,</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>put to that person by an investigating official, who at that time, was performing functions in connection with the investigation of the commission, or possible commission, of an offence (s89(1) refers).</li>
<li>For a serious indictable offence, s89A provides unfavourable inferences may be drawn if A failed / refused to mention a fact that A could reasonably have been expected to mention in the circumstances existing at the time, and that is relied on in his / her defence in that proceeding (s89A(1) refers).
<ul>
<li>AKA TELL THEM YOUR ALIBI</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Certain requirements such as a ‚ÄòSpecial Caution‚Äô apply in relation to s89A.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Silence at Trial
<ul>
<li>How does the law address the situation where the Accused elects to remain silent at trial ?
<ul>
<li>The Accused has the right to remain silent at trial and put the Prosecution to proof.  Consequently he / she may elect not to give evidence or not call evidence on his / her behalf.</li>
<li>As set out in s20 EA, the Prosecution is not permitted to make comment about the Accused‚Äôs election not to give evidence. (Raises questions about what ‚Äòcomment‚Äô actually means ????)</li>
<li>Under s20(2) the Judge, or other party (not Prosecution), may comment on the Accused‚Äôs election but must not make a comment that suggests / infers that the Defendant is guilty of the offence. cf  Weissensteiner v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 217</li>
<li>This section only applies in criminal proceeding for an indictable offence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Evidence Act s20 - Comment on failure to give evidence
<ul>
<li>(1) This section applies only in a criminal proceeding for an indictable offence.</li>
<li>(2) The Judge or any party (other than the Prosecutor) may comment on a failure of the Defendant to give evidence. However, unless the comment is made by another Defendant in the proceeding, the comment must not suggest that the Defendant failed to give evidence because the defendant was, or believed that he or she was, guilty of the offence concerned.</li>
<li>(3) ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Weissensteiner v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 217
<ul>
<li>Facts: W went on a boat trip with a young couple. Sometime during the trip, the couple dropped out of contact with everyone they knew and stopped drawing upon their bank account. W returned alone, with the boat, and with some of their possessions. When questioned about their whereabouts, he gave conflicting explanations. He was charged with their murder and tried. At his trial, he did not give evidence. The TJ told the jury that, since W was the only person in the world in a position to contradict or deny the Crown case (that he murdered them), and he elected not to do so, the jury could more safely draw an inference of guilt from his decision not to testify.
<ul>
<li>HCA: Held that this was a permissible comment to make.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The HCA decision in Weissensteiner is at odds with the basis for s20 ‚Äì the practical protection the Accused‚Äôs right to silence.</li>
<li>*** Weissensteiner reflected a principle that originated in civil case of Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The enactment of the EA has clarified the limitations on judicial comments about the Accused‚Äôs decision not to testify.
<ul>
<li>When examining s20, the superior courts have said that comments about adverse inferences should be seen as an interference with the right to silence, which is an entrenched and fundamental right.</li>
<li>In light of HCA decisions in RPS, Azzopardi and Dyers, it is clear that only in a rare and exceptional case, where the facts would be peculiarly within the knowledge of the Defendant, will the Judge be permitted to make an adverse comment about the Defendant‚Äôs failure to give evidence.  This is how the HCA reconciled and rehabilitated its decision in Weissensteiner v R (1993) 178 CLR 217.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>RPS v The Queen (2000) 199 CLR 620
<ul>
<li>Facts: RPS was on trial for sexual assaults against his daughter between the ages of 4 and 14.
<ul>
<li>The evidence against him came from his daughter (complainant) and her mother, to whom RPS had apparently made certain admissions about the sexual assaults.</li>
<li>RPS elected not to give evidence, which means in effect that he did not deny the evidence against him.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>HCA: Held that Weissensteiner, and all the cases that relied on it, were no longer applicable.
<ul>
<li>HCA said that, in a criminal trial, the entire onus is upon the Prosecution, and it will never ‚Äì or rarely ‚Äì be reasonable to expect the accused to testify.</li>
<li>HCA also held that s20 prohibits the TJ from commenting in any way that suggests the accused is guilty of the offence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>*** The following year, in Azzopardi v The Queen (2001) 205 CLR 50, the HCA affirmed this decision.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dyers v The Queen (2002) 210 CLR 285
<ul>
<li>Facts: Dyers was the leader of what the HCA later described as a ‚Äúcult‚Äù called Kenja.
<ul>
<li>A 13-year-old girl was the daughter of a Kenja member, and the girl attended what was called a ‚Äúprocessing session‚Äù with Dyers during which she alleges he sexually assaulted her.</li>
<li>In his defence, Dyers said he had an alibi. At the time the girl alleges he sexually assaulted her, he said he had an appointment for an ‚Äúenergy conversion‚Äù session with a woman called Wendy.</li>
<li>He tendered his appointment diary to show that he had an appointment with Wendy at the time. He did not call Wendy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>TJ said to the jury: ‚Äúyou are not entitled to speculate on what the witness might have said if the witness had been called‚Äù.
<ul>
<li>Also said that they were ‚Äúentitled to draw the inference that the evidence of that witness would not have assisted the party who you have assessed should have called that witness‚Äù.</li>
<li>Went on to say, ‚Äúyou do not have to draw the inference that I have suggested‚Äù.</li>
<li>TJ emphasised that ‚Äúit is for the Crown to prove [the charge] and to do so beyond reasonable doubt.</li>
<li>And that there is no onus on the accused to prove anything‚Äù.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The NSWCCA thought that there was nothing wrong with the TJ‚Äôs comments, and that it would have been ‚Äúabundantly clear‚Äù to the jury that Dyers did not have to discharge any onus.</li>
<li>HCA: Majority held that the TJ‚Äôs directions contravened s20 - quashing the conviction and ordering a re-trial.
<ul>
<li>Majority stressed that nothing must interfere with the Accused person‚Äôs right to silence, nor with the presumption of innocence.</li>
<li>Unanimously agreed that the accused does not need to give or call any evidence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the Accused does not give evidence at Trial, these directions should be given:
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The silence of the Accused is not evidence against the Accused (Azzopardi (2001) 205 CLR 50 [51]),</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>The silence of the Accused cannot be treated as an admission of guilt (OGD (1997) 45 NSWLR 744, R v Baker [2001] NSWCCA 151, Azzopardi (2001) 205 CLR 50),</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="3">
<li>The silence of the Accused cannot be used to fill gaps in the prosecution case (Azzopardi (2001) 205 CLR 50), and</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="4">
<li>The silence of the Accused cannot be used as a make-weight in assessing whether the Crown has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt (Azzopardi (2001) 205 CLR 50)</li>
</ol>
