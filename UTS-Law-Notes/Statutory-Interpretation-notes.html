<li>Section 29 presents consultation requirements, listing out required stakeholders for consultation, including the Ministry of Health, the Department of Communities and Justice, Transport for NSW, local Aboriginal community leaders, and other specified stakeholders.</li>
<li>Section 51(1)(a) of the legislation states that this section applies to different types of authorizations that can be granted by the Authority, including an extended trading authorization.</li>
<li>Section 51(2) elaborates on the requirements for applying for an authorization. The application must be in a form and manner approved by the Authority, be accompanied by the prescribed fee and the necessary information, must be advertised if required by regulations, and must comply with other requirements as approved by the Authority or as prescribed by regulations.</li>
<li>Section 51(7) indicates that the regulations may prescribe a fee for the granting of an authorization. The authorization does not take effect until the fee, if prescribed or determined, has been paid.</li>

<li>explain what issues are raised - together with legal elements 800 wordsish</li>
<li>Fit and Proper Person Requirement: The applicant, Gia Gambina, must demonstrate good character, honesty, integrity, and competency to carry on the business. This requirement ensures that the licensee is suitable to operate a licensed premise.</li>
<li>Impact on Various Sectors: The Authority must consider the impact of the application on sectors such as the live music industry, arts, tourism, and the community or cultural sector. This assessment ensures that the application aligns with the broader interests and development of the community.
<ul>
<li>Community Impact Statement (CIS): The application must be accompanied by a CIS, which outlines the potential impact on the local community. The CIS should address concerns related to the extended operating hours, increased gambling opportunities, and any other relevant issues raised by the community.</li>
<li>Consultation and Local Community Views: The Authority is required to consider the views and concerns of the local community when assessing the application. This includes consultation with stakeholders such as the Ministry of Health, the Department of Communities and Justice, Transport for NSW, local Aboriginal community leaders, and other specified stakeholders.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Compliance and Additional Requirements: The application must meet the criteria for compliance, including the payment of fees, submission of additional information, and advertisement of the application. The Authority may impose restrictions or additional requirements before granting the license.</li>
<li>Disturbance to the Neighborhood: The extended trading authorization (ETA) application must not cause frequent undue disturbance to the peace and order of the neighborhood. This criterion ensures that the extended hours do not negatively impact the local community‚Äôs peace and well-being.</li>
<li>Gambling Activities: The application involves an increase in the number of gaming machines, which falls under the category of gambling activities. The regulations under the Liquor Act 2007 and Liquor Regulation 2018 outline specific requirements and considerations for applications related to gambling activities.</li>
<li>Fee Payment: The authorization does not take effect until the prescribed fee, if any, has been paid. This ensures that the necessary financial obligations are met before the authorization is granted.</li>
<li>Interpret the legislative provisions - 400 wordsish
<ul>
<li>interpretation legislation, general principles of interpretation, judicial or quasi-judicial decisions, and extrinsic sources.</li>
<li>Literal Rule and Purposive Approach: The provisions of the Liquor Act 2007 and Liquor Regulation 2018 should be interpreted based on their plain and ordinary meaning (literal rule) while considering the purpose and intention of the legislation (purposive approach). This includes understanding the requirements for license applications, the conditions for granting licenses, and the impact on various sectors mentioned in Section 45(7).</li>
<li>Contextual Interpretation: The provisions should be interpreted in the context of the overall legislative framework governing the extension of hotel trading hours in New South Wales. This requires considering Sections 40-43 as the generic provisions for license applications and Section 48 as the specific provision for community impact statements.</li>
<li>Precedents and Judicial Decisions: Relevant court or quasi-judicial decisions related to license applications, community impact statements, and extended trading authorizations should be considered to understand the interpretation and application of the provisions in similar cases. These decisions may provide guidance on factors to be considered, requirements for community impact statements, and the imposition of restrictions on granting licenses.</li>
<li>Extrinsic Sources: Extrinsic sources, such as legislative history, reports, explanatory memoranda, and parliamentary debates, may provide additional insight into the legislative intent and assist in interpreting the provisions. These sources can provide background information, policy considerations, and the rationale behind the legislation.</li>
<li>Interpretation Legislation: Any specific interpretation acts or legislation applicable in the jurisdiction should be consulted to understand any specific rules or principles of interpretation that may apply to the Liquor Act 2007 and Liquor Regulation 2018.</li>
<li>local consent authority, in relation to licensed premises or proposed licensed premises, means‚Äî</li>
<li>(a)  the local council in whose area (within the meaning of the Local Government Act 1993) the premises are, or will be, situated, or</li>
<li>(b)  if consent to the carrying out of development on the land concerned is required from a person or body other than the council‚Äîthat person or body.</li>

<li>The Principal Lawyer supervising your work has noticed that that the Authority‚Äôs file on this area of law is out of date.</li>
<li>She asks you to update it by following the instructions below:
<ul>
<li>
<p>List FOUR sources that would directly assist in understanding the laws regarding liquor licences in NSW and be relevant to the specific advice you have given above.</p>
<ul>
<li>The four sources must be selected from the following categories, with no more than one source from each of these six categories:
<ul>
<li>journal article</li>
<li>book or edited book</li>
<li>chapter in edited book</li>
<li>institutional research report</li>
<li>government guide or information sheet</li>
<li>Judicial or tribunal decision.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Journal
<ul>
<li>AGIS Plus Text</li>
<li>Hein Online</li>
<li>The Australian and New Zealand Journal of Criminology</li>
<li>The first source derives from the journal ‚ÄúProblematic Licensed Premises for Assault in Inner Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong,‚Äù a journal article in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Criminology. This text posits that a small minority of licensed premises appear to be the most problematic for alcohol-related violence, specifically those in large CBDs such as Sydney, Wollongong, and Newcastle. This resource examines the effects of restricting or expanding trading hours on rates of alcohol-related problems; it focuses on the small minority of 6% of licensed premises accounting for two-thirds of all on-premises assaults. This book can be found using the AGIS Plus Text (Informit) tool and applying the keywords ‚ÄòNSW hotel Extended trading hours.‚Äô</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Chapter in edited book
<ul>
<li>The following source was from the book ‚ÄúStemming the Tide of Alcohol,‚Äù a novel in conjunction with the Canberra Foundation for Alcohol Research and Education. Chapter 14, ‚ÄúLimits on trading hours, particularly late-night trading,‚Äù provides relevant insights into the history, regulations, and impact of trading hours in the context of liquor licensing. This resource examines the effects of restricting or expanding trading hours on rates of alcohol-related problems; it focuses on the emergence of late-night trading and its potential to reduce alcohol-related harm. This book can be found using the Google Scholars tool and applying the keywords ‚Äòextended trading hours NSW.‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Case - find a better case
<ul>
<li>Secheny v Blacktown City Council [2009] NSWLEC 1361</li>
<li>An additional resource to consider is Secheny v Blacktown City Council [2009], a case with similar objectors, although these objectors expressed even greater disapproval than this situation. In this situation, the judge found that management‚Äôs preventative measures justified a trial period of extended hours to assess patron response and monitor potential issues, an idea applicable to this situation. This case was discovered using the keywords ‚ÄòNSW applying for ‚Äúhotel Extended trading hours‚Äù‚Äô on Lexis Advance Research, chosen for the relevance to this case and the recency.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Institution report
<ul>
<li>The final source, found in Google Scholar with the additional terms ‚Äúauthority gaming liquor laws,‚Äù is an e-brief by the authoritative NSW Parliamentary Research Service titled ‚ÄúLiquor licensing restrictions to address alcohol-related violence in NSW: 2008 to 2014.‚Äù This brief outlines the major licensing restrictions introduced since 2008 while referring to studies conducted on the effectiveness of certain limits, and examining trends in alcohol-related assaults.</li>

<li>In a few sentences, justify why you selected each source as authoritative and useful to your advice work, and document your research strategy (i.e., what specific databases and search terms did you use to identify the relevant sources).</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>It is not sufficient to list sources that merely have a general connection with the topics of liquor licencing or gaming ‚Äî they must be relevant to the factual situation given, and you must clearly explain the nature of that connection</li>
