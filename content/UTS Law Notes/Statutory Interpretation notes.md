    - Impact on Various Sectors: The Authority must consider the impact of the application on sectors such as the live music industry, arts, tourism, and the community or cultural sector. This assessment ensures that the application aligns with the broader interests and development of the community.
      - Community Impact Statement (CIS): The application must be accompanied by a CIS, which outlines the potential impact on the local community. The CIS should address concerns related to the extended operating hours, increased gambling opportunities, and any other relevant issues raised by the community.

    - Literal Rule and Purposive Approach: The provisions of the Liquor Act 2007 and Liquor Regulation 2018 should be interpreted based on their plain and ordinary meaning (literal rule) while considering the purpose and intention of the legislation (purposive approach). This includes understanding the requirements for license applications, the conditions for granting licenses, and the impact on various sectors mentioned in Section 45(7).
    - Contextual Interpretation: The provisions should be interpreted in the context of the overall legislative framework governing the extension of hotel trading hours in New South Wales.

These sources can provide background information, policy considerations, and the rationale behind the legislation.

Part C: 350 words
- The Principal Lawyer supervising your work has noticed that that the Authority’s file on this area of law is out of date. 
- She asks you to update it by following the instructions below:
  - List FOUR sources that would directly assist in understanding the laws regarding liquor licences in NSW and be relevant to the specific advice you have given above. 
    - The four sources must be selected from the following categories, with no more than one source from each of these six categories:
      - journal article
      - book or edited book
      - chapter in edited book
      - institutional research report
      - government guide or information sheet
      - Judicial or tribunal decision.
    - Journal
      - AGIS Plus Text
      - Hein Online
      - The Australian and New Zealand Journal of Criminology
      - The first source derives from the journal "Problematic Licensed Premises for Assault in Inner Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong," a journal article in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Criminology. This text posits that a small minority of licensed premises appear to be the most problematic for alcohol-related violence, specifically those in large CBDs such as Sydney, Wollongong, and Newcastle. This resource examines the effects of restricting or expanding trading hours on rates of alcohol-related problems; it focuses on the small minority of 6% of licensed premises accounting for two-thirds of all on-premises assaults. This book can be found using the AGIS Plus Text (Informit) tool and applying the keywords 'NSW hotel Extended trading hours.' 
      - 
      - 
      - 
    - Chapter in edited book
      - The following source was from the book "Stemming the Tide of Alcohol," a novel in conjunction with the Canberra Foundation for Alcohol Research and Education. Chapter 14, "Limits on trading hours, particularly late-night trading," provides relevant insights into the history, regulations, and impact of trading hours in the context of liquor licensing. This resource examines the effects of restricting or expanding trading hours on rates of alcohol-related problems; it focuses on the emergence of late-night trading and its potential to reduce alcohol-related harm. This book can be found using the Google Scholars tool and applying the keywords 'extended trading hours NSW.' 
    - Case - find a better case
      - Secheny v Blacktown City Council [2009] NSWLEC 1361
      - An additional resource to consider is Secheny v Blacktown City Council [2009], a case with similar objectors, although these objectors expressed even greater disapproval than this situation. In this situation, the judge found that management's preventative measures justified a trial period of extended hours to assess patron response and monitor potential issues, an idea applicable to this situation. This case was discovered using the keywords 'NSW applying for "hotel Extended trading hours"' on Lexis Advance Research, chosen for the relevance to this case and the recency. 
    - Institution report
      - The final source, found in Google Scholar with the additional terms "authority gaming liquor laws," is an e-brief by the authoritative NSW Parliamentary Research Service titled "Liquor licensing restrictions to address alcohol-related violence in NSW: 2008 to 2014." This brief outlines the major licensing restrictions introduced since 2008 while referring to studies conducted on the effectiveness of certain limits, and examining trends in alcohol-related assaults.

  - 8. In a few sentences, justify why you selected each source as authoritative and useful to your advice work, and document your research strategy (i.e., what specific databases and search terms did you use to identify the relevant sources). 
    - It is not sufficient to list sources that merely have a general connection with the topics of liquor licencing or gaming — they must be relevant to the factual situation given, and you must clearly explain the nature of that connection
