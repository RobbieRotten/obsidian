<li>Five key indications of statements being terms or conditions
<ul>
<li>Timing
<ul>
<li>Oceanic Sun Line Special Shipping Company lnc v Fay (1988) 165 CLR 197
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòIt was too late after the original contract was made to add conditions which were not incorporated in it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Anything before contract is signed is admissable</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Language
<ul>
<li>Oscar Chess Ltd v Williams [1957] 1 WLR 370</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Expertise
<ul>
<li>Expertise of representor may indicate a pre-contractual statement is intended as a term.</li>
<li>Someone in a position to guarantee the truth of a statement more likely to intend contractual liability for it.</li>
<li>Oscar Chess Ltd v Williams [1957] 1 WLR 370
<ul>
<li>Williams sold a ‚Äò1948 Morris 10 Saloon‚Äô to Oscar Chess for lbs 290.</li>
<li>Williams had represented that the car was a 1948 Model Morris based on registration book.</li>
<li>Car was a 1939 model worth lbs 175.</li>
<li>Did Williams promise that the car was a 1948 model?
<ul>
<li>Did not have personal knowledge</li>
<li>Was relying on the rego book</li>
<li>Therefore not likely liable</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Importance
<ul>
<li>No defined meaning:
<ul>
<li>Necessary for the contract to function.</li>
<li>Objectively important to the representee or representor.</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Form
<ul>
<li>Statements recorded in writing more likely to be intended to be terms.
<ul>
<li>Specially if the form of the document is clearly contractual.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Signature</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Notice
<ul>
<li>Equuscorp Pty Ltd v Glengallan Investments Pty Lt (2004) 218 CLR 471
<ul>
<li>Respondents borrowed money from Rural Finance to invest in Equuscorp‚Äôs project.</li>
<li>Signed formal loan agreements.</li>
<li>Trial judge found that Rural had orally promised ‚Äòlimited recourse‚Äô before the respondents signed.</li>
<li>Oral promise not in loan documents
<ul>
<li>Was the oral promise an enforceable term?
<ul>
<li>collateral agreement (made in consideration of the parties later executing the written agreement)</li>
<li>But that cannot be so here.
<ul>
<li>The oral limited recourse terms alleged by the respondents contradict the terms of the written loan agreement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Apply the BP Refinery test (all 5 conditions) when implying a term into a formal contract.
<ul>
<li>Implied term interpretation construction loosley:</li>
<li>Formal term interpretation construction strictly:
<ul>
<li>(1) it must be reasonable and equitable;</li>
<li>(2) it must be necessary to give business efficacy (got to make it work) to the contract, so that no term will be implied if the contract is effective without it;</li>
<li>(3) it must be so obvious that ‚Äúit goes without saying‚Äù;</li>
<li>(4) it must be capable of clear expression;</li>
<li>(5) it must not contradict any express term of the contract.‚Äô 282-3 (Lord Simon of Glaisdale for the majority)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Koompahtoo Local Aboriginal Land Council v Sanpine Pty Ltd (2007) 233 CLR 115
<ul>
<li>‚Äô‚Ä¶ a right to terminate arises in respect of:
<ul>
<li>(1) breach of an essential term;</li>
<li>(2) breach of a non-essential term causing substantial loss of benefit; or</li>
<li>(3) repudiation (in the sense of ‚Äúrenunciation‚Äù).</li>
<li>The common thread uniting the three categories is conduct inconsistent with the fundamental postulate of the contractual agreement.‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Laurinda Pty Ltd v Capalaba Park Shopping Centre Pty Ltd (1989) 166 CLR 623
<ul>
<li>Repudiation test
<ul>
<li>Would a reasonable person in the shoes of the innocent party clearly infer that the other party would not be bound by the contract
<ul>
<li>or would fulfil it only in a manner substantially inconsistent with that party‚Äôs obligations and in no other way?‚Äô</li>

<li>Leading Australian case: Codelfa Construction ELEMENTS of misrepresentation
<ul>
<li>Actionable representation:
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>False pre-contractual statement of past/present fact (not an opinion or statement that something will happen);</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>Made by the defendant to induce the plaintiff into the contract;</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="3">
<li>Which in fact induces the plaintiff into the contract (reliance).</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>TYPES AND REMEDIES</li>
<li>THREE TYPES
<ul>
<li>Innocent</li>
<li>Fraudulent</li>
<li>Negligent</li>
<li>The type determines whether damages are available in addition to rescission.</li>
<li>Only fraudulent and innocent assessed in this subject.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION / DECEIT
<ul>
<li>Common law allows rescission for fraudulent misrepresentation.</li>
<li>Remedy
<ul>
<li>Plaintiff can choose:
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Rescission (Restoration to pre-contractual position) or</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>Damages (Affirm the contract and sue in tort of deceit).</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Magill v Magill (2006) 226 CLR 551
<ul>
<li>The modern tort of deceit will be established where a plaintiff can</li>
<li>show five elements of deceit:
<ul>
<li>first, that the defendant made a false representation;</li>
<li>secondly, that the defendant made the representation with the knowledge that it was false, or that the defendant was reckless or careless as to whether the representation was false or not</li>
<li>thirdly, that the defendant made the representation with the intention that it be relied upon by the plaintiff;</li>
<li>fourthly, that the plaintiff acted in reliance on the false representation; and</li>
<li>fifthly, that the plaintiff suffered damage which was caused by reliance on the false representation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Derry v Peek (1889) 14 App Cas 33
<ul>
<li>‚Äô‚Ä¶ if fraud be proved, the motive of the person guilty of it is immaterial.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>INNOCENT MISREPRESENTATION
<ul>
<li>Redgrave v Hurd (1881) 20 Ch D 1
<ul>
<li>Where the defendant honestly believed the statement was correct / was not aware that it was false.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rescission is the only remedy for innocent misrepresentation ‚Äì no damages.</li>
<li>Innocent misrepresentation is the ‚Äúdefault finding‚Äù.
<ul>
<li>The plaintiff has the onus of proving any fraud or negligence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Remedy = rescission of the contract.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ELEMENTS of Non Est Factum
<ul>
<li>Legal instrument (contract, deed, etc) signed by a party;</li>
<li>Signer unable to read/understand the instrument</li>
<li>Signer:</li>
<li>Subjectively mistaken about the legal effect of the instrument; or</li>
<li>Unable to comprehend the legal effect of the instrument.</li>
<li>When claiming against innocent 3Ps: the signer was not careless.</li>
<li>Did the signer‚Äôs mind ‚Äúgo with the pen‚Äù?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Two forms of unfair pressure recognised at general law:
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Duress (common law)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>two elements of duress:
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>pressure amounting to compulsion of the will of the victim; and</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>the illegitimacy of the pressure exerted</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>Undue influence (equity)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Plaintiff might be capable of looking after own interests, but is subject to (elements of undue influence):
<ul>
<li>pressure</li>
<li>influence</li>
<li>manipulation</li>
<li>misinformation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>such that the plaintiff cannot be said to have exercised free will.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Undue influence involves a skewing of free will but not necessarily through illegitimate means.
<ul>
<li>Unconscionable conduct involves taking advantage of a vulnerable party; often considered an extension or subset of undue influence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Undue influence + unconscionable conduct
<ul>
<li>Facts suggest that plaintiff:
<ul>
<li>was at a special disadvantage vis-a-vis the defendant; AND</li>
<li>influence was applied by the defendant such that the plaintiff did not exercise his or her own free will.</li>
<li>D must show signing is fair, just, and reasonable</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Undue Influence
<ul>
<li>Johnson v Buttress (1936) 56 CLR 113
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe jurisdiction of a court of equity to set aside gifts [and contracts] inter vivos which have been procured by undue influence is exercised where
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>undue influence is proved as a fact, or [‚Äòactual undue influence‚Äô]</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>where, undue influence being presumed from the relations existing between the parties, the presumption has not been rebutted.‚Äô [‚Äòpresumed undue influence‚Äô]</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Duress vs Undue influence
<ul>
<li>The defense of duress exists to protect against contracts that are obtained by some type of threat or coercion.</li>
<li>The defense of undue influence exists for a more specialized role, to protect against assent obtained by unfair persuasion.</li>

<li>Tried to remove this idea, said no binding agreement</li>

<li>Judge upheld gibson as open contract</li>
<li>Appeal - dissent held that it was a negotiating step for contract, owing to the change in the political complexion of the council, never reached fruition.</li>

<ul>
<li>Consideration
<ul>
<li>The second element necessary for contract formation is consideration</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consideration Essential elements - Bargain theory authority on Consideration
<ul>
<li>Case: Australian Woollen Mills Pty Ltd v Commonwealth (1954) 92 CLR 424 (Privy Council); (1955) 93 CLR 546 (High Court of Australia)</li>
<li>Jurisdiction: Privy Council; High Court of Australia</li>
<li>Facts: Australian Woollen Mills Pty Ltd (AWM) claimed a unilateral contract arose from the Commonwealth government‚Äôs wool subsidy scheme.
<ul>
<li>The scheme subsidized wool purchases for woollen product manufacturers after World War II to ensure low prices.</li>
<li>The Commonwealth promised subsidies to manufacturers buying domestic-use wool.</li>
<li>AWM purchased wool based on this promise but later repaid excess subsidies due to scheme discontinuation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Procedural History: AWM sued Commonwealth for recovery of repaid subsidies and unpaid subsidies on certain purchases</li>
<li>Issue Raised: Whether the letters from Commonwealth constituted a binding offer to form unilateral contracts with manufacturers like AWM.</li>
<li>Legal Reasoning and Ratio:
<ul>
<li>The alleged contracts were of the unilateral type, with acceptance through performance.</li>
<li>To establish a contract, the statement must be offered as consideration for an act, with a quid pro quo relationship between the statement and the act.</li>
<li>In cases like these, the presence of an implied or express request by the alleged promisor is essential to determine the existence of an offer.</li>
<li>The intention to create a legally enforceable duty must be present in the offer.</li>
<li>An implied request can provide a useful test for determining a true offer and acceptance for contract formation.</li>
<li>In this case, the letters from the Commonwealth were statements of policy, not contractual offers. The scheme was more administrative than contractual.</li>
<li>The presence of a request does not automatically establish a contract; it depends on the intention to create an obligation.</li>
<li>Consideration must be sufficient, not adequate
<ul>
<li>(consideration definition).</li>
<li>a contract should be a bargain supported by consideration in the nature of a quid pro quo</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ratio
<ul>
<li>ratio decidendi of Australian Woollen Mills Pty Ltd v Commonwealth is that the expenditure of money in reliance on an announcement by the government that it would pay a subsidy to a manufacturer on wool purchased and used for local manufacture is not itself sufficient to create a contract to pay the subsidy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Result: The court dismissed AWM‚Äôs claim, ruling that no binding contracts were constituted, and the Commonwealth‚Äôs letters were statements of policy rather than contractual offers. The appeal was also dismissed by the Privy Council.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Beaton v McDivitt (1987) 13 NSWLR 162
<ul>
<li>Split 25 acres</li>
<li>Gave quarter land to ‚Äúsomeone interested in the form of cultivation known as permaculture to work the block‚Äù</li>
<li>Occupied land without payment - per agreement</li>
<li>Dillwyn v Llewelyn - ‚Äúan exception to the modern requirement that a contract should be a bargain supported by consideration in the nature of a quid pro quo‚Äù. (consideration definition).</li>
<li>consideration must be satisfied in the form of a price in return for the promisor‚Äôs promise or a quid pro quo.
<ul>
<li>duties arising from bargains entered between free parties were to be enforced, not duties deriving from suggested moral obligations such as those deriving from relationships</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Private road maintenance is not enough to constitute a bargain between them/contract
<ul>
<li>Gaining the land was not the purpose of the transaction</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gift and ex post facto consideration
<ul>
<li>Not a gift, a license to the land</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Thomas v Thomas (1842)
<ul>
<li>Consideration means something which is of some value in the eye of the law, moving from the plaintiff:</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Currie v Misa (1875) LR 10 Exch 153 at 162</li>
<li>A valuable consideration, in the sense of the law, may consist either in some right, interest, profit, or benefit accruing to one party, or some forbearance, detriment, loss, or responsibility, given, suffered, or undertaken by the other.‚Äù</li>
<li>The contract
<ul>
<li>Three situations
<ul>
<li>a promise to transfer property subject to the occurrence of an event or condition
<ul>
<li>promise will not be enforceable even if the event or condition [183] occurs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>a promise to transfer property after which the promisor allows the promisee to act to his detriment in reliance on the promise.
<ul>
<li>equity may prevent the promisor insisting on his strict rights and may enforce the promise</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>where the promise contains an express or implied request by the promisor to do an act or fulfill a condition</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Frustration
<ul>
<li>subdivision is not a legal impossibility; it is possible that in all the circumstances the council might permit the land to be subdivided to enable the title to lot B to pass to the plaintiff</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The duty to co-operate
<ul>
<li>Secured Income Real Estate (Aust) Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Ltd (1979)
<ul>
<li>The McDivitts have a contractual duty to do everything necessary on their part to enable the plaintiff to have the benefit of the contract</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MAHONEY JA: [175] In my opinion, the transaction between the parties constituted a contract
<ul>
<li>rezoning was a condition subsequent to the contractual arrangements mad
<ul>
<li>Rezoning was no a condition of the contract or that, if it was, the contract has been terminated by failure of it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adequacy OF CONSIDERATION
<ul>
<li>adequacy of consideration refers to its intrinsic value
<ul>
<li>Adequate consideration vs sufficient or good consideration</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Woolworths Ltd v Kelly (1991) 22 NSWLR 189
<ul>
<li>If courts were to entertain disputes concerning the adequacy, or inadequacy, of consideration for a bargain, and if such issues were justiciable, they would lead to litigation prone to open up a vast territory of evidence.</li>
<li>Bargains are too uncertain</li>
<li>Economic freedom from paternalistic courts</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SUFFICIENCY OF CONSIDERATION
<ul>
<li>Past consideration
<ul>
<li>Past consideration is not considered sufficient consideration.
<ul>
<li>Thus, if P performs an apparently gratuitous service for D and D later promises to pay P for that service, D‚Äôs promise will not be enforceable unless specifically agreed.</li>

<li>Case Summary: Foakes v Beer (1884) 9 App Cas 605 (House of Lords)
<ul>
<li>Appeal Information: This was an appeal from the Court of Appeal.</li>
<li>Facts:
<ul>
<li>On 11 August 1875, Beer obtained a judgment against Foakes for a debt amounting to ¬£2 090 19s.</li>
<li>On 21 December 1876, a memorandum of agreement was made and signed by Foakes and Beer.</li>
<li>This agreement specified that if Foakes paid ¬£500 immediately and further installments of ¬£150 on specified dates until the full sum was paid off, Beer would not proceed with the judgment.</li>
<li>By June 1882, Beer took out a summons to proceed on the judgment, leading to a trial on the matter of the debt‚Äôs status.</li>
<li>It was determined at trial that Foakes had paid all required instalments but Beer claimed unpaid interest.</li>
<li>Cave J found in favour of Foakes, believing Beer could not execute any sum due to the agreement.</li>
<li>The Queen‚Äôs Bench Division upheld the decision. However, the Court of Appeal reversed it, favoring Beer‚Äôs claim for the interest.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Judgment (Earl of Selbourne LC):
<ul>
<li>[610] Raised doubts about whether the agreement meant waiving the interest Beer was entitled to by law.</li>
<li>[611] Stressed that the agreement could not be legally enforced against Beer unless there was consideration.</li>
<li>The main question was whether paying a lesser amount than the full debt could be considered legal satisfaction for the whole debt.</li>
<li>Referenced the doctrine stated by Sir Edward Coke in Pinnel‚Äôs case from 1602. According to this, paying a lesser amount could not satisfy a larger debt.</li>
<li>The doctrine made a distinction between agreements under seal and those not under seal. The former is binding, while the latter requires consideration.</li>
<li>[614] The creditor‚Äôs benefit from getting part of their money does not serve as legal consideration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Lords (LORD WATSON, LORD FITZGERALD):
<ul>
<li>Both concurred with Earl of Selbourne LC‚Äôs conclusions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>LORD BLACKBURN:
<ul>
<li>[622] Emphasized that many men of business would see value in prompt payment of part of a debt rather than waiting for full payment, especially when there‚Äôs doubt about the debtor‚Äôs solvency.</li>
<li>Had reservations about fully agreeing with the majority opinion but did not elucidate his full dissent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Decision: The appeal was dismissed, upholding the Court of Appeal‚Äôs decision in favor of Beer.</li>

<p>Williams v Roffey Bros &amp; Nicholls (Contractors)</p>
<ul>
<li>Court &amp; Date: Court of Appeal, 1991</li>
<li>Parties:
<ul>
<li>Plaintiff/Appellant: Williams</li>
<li>Defendant/Respondent: Roffey Bros &amp; Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Facts:
<ul>
<li>Roffey Bros held a contract to refurbish 27 flats.</li>
<li>Williams was subcontracted by Roffey Bros for carpentry for ¬£20,000.</li>
<li>Williams faced financial difficulties due to the low agreed price.</li>
<li>To ensure completion and avoid penalties for delay, Roffey Bros orally agreed to pay Williams an extra ¬£10,300, at ¬£575 per flat.</li>
<li>Williams continued work but stopped after seven weeks when he had only been paid ¬£1,500 by the defendants.</li>
<li>Roffey Bros did not pay the outstanding balance.</li>
<li>Roffey Bros then hired other carpenters to finish the work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Issue:
<ul>
<li>Was there consideration for Roffey Bros‚Äô promise to pay Williams an additional ¬£10,300, at the rate of ¬£575 per completed flat?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Holding:
<ul>
<li>Yes, there was consideration for the promise.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reasoning:
<ul>
<li>The main contention was the traditional legal principle from Stilk v Myrick that performing an existing contractual obligation is not good consideration for a new promise.</li>
<li>It was recognized that the promise to pay more was in both parties‚Äô interests.</li>
<li>Roffey Bros derived practical benefits,
<ul>
<li>such as ensuring Williams continued his work, avoiding penalties, and avoiding the costs of hiring new carpenters.</li>
<li>Practical benefits means that the benefit of not receiving the full amount is still worth it because they are providing enough of a service to get by</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>GLIDEWELL LJ outlined a proposition that refined the traditional principle, stating that if a party obtains a benefit from a promise, and it isn‚Äôt due to duress or fraud, it can be considered good consideration.</li>
<li>Based on these findings, the promise by Roffey Bros was supported by valuable consideration and is enforceable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Judgment:
<ul>
<li>The appeal was dismissed. Williams‚Äô agreement with Roffey Bros was legally binding and enforceable.</li>

<ul>
<li>Jurisdiction: Binding in New South Wales.</li>
<li>Procedural History:
<ul>
<li>Plaintiffs were tenants of a fruit and vegetable shop owned by the defendant.</li>
<li>A larger competing fruit and vegetable shop was introduced in the same shopping center, threatening plaintiffs‚Äô ability to pay rent.</li>
<li>Defendant initially promised reduced rent but later sought to withdraw the promise.</li>
<li>Plaintiffs sought a declaration that the reduced rent promise was binding.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Original Dispute:
<ul>
<li>Plaintiffs‚Äô ability to pay rent was threatened due to competition from a larger tenant.</li>
<li>Defendant initially promised reduced rent but later wanted to withdraw this promise.</li>

<li>Current Reason for Trial:
<ul>
<li>To determine whether the reduced rent promise by the landlord was binding.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>Plaintiffs were tenants of a shop owned by the defendant.</li>
<li>A larger competitor tenant was introduced in the shopping center, endangering plaintiffs‚Äô ability to pay rent.</li>

<li>SANTOW J discussed the application of the ‚ÄúWilliams v Roffey‚Äù case and debated the concept of consideration, economic duress, and fairness.</li>
<li>Critiqued the traditional notion of consideration and proposed a broader approach based on practical benefit or detriment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Legal Reasoning and Ratio:
<ul>
<li>The judge re-examined the principles of consideration and economic duress.</li>
<li>Proposed that practical benefits or detriments could suffice as consideration.</li>
<li>Consideration need not be strictly commensurate with the value exchanged.</li>
<li>Proposed a reformulated approach for determining enforceability based on practical benefits or detriments and fairness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Result:
<ul>
<li>The judge concluded that, subject to re-casting the elements of the ‚ÄúWilliams v Roffey‚Äù case, a practical benefit or detriment could suffice as consideration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The reduced rent promise was found to be binding based on the practical benefit to the landlord and detriment to the tenants.</li>

<p>Case Summary (Detailed)</p>
<ul>
<li>Name of the Case and Citation:
<ul>
<li>Williams v Roffey Bros &amp; Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd [1991] 1 QB 1</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jurisdiction:
<ul>
<li>England and Wales (Court of Appeal)</li>
<li>Binding within its jurisdiction and persuasive in many common law jurisdictions globally.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Procedural History:
<ul>
<li>Williams initially brought the case to the Queen‚Äôs Bench Division seeking the extra payment as promised by Roffey Bros.</li>
<li>The matter was then appealed to the Court of Appeal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Original Dispute:
<ul>
<li>The initial disagreement was concerning the amount payable under a carpentry contract.</li>
<li>Williams struggled to complete the work at the originally agreed price due to unforeseen financial hardships.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Current Reason for Trial:
<ul>
<li>The appeal sought to determine whether Roffey Bros‚Äô promise to pay extra, despite no new consideration being apparent, was enforceable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Material Facts:
<ul>
<li>Williams and Roffey Bros entered into a contract where Williams was to provide carpentry services for a predetermined price.</li>
<li>Due to unforeseen financial constraints, Williams approached Roffey Bros, indicating he could not finish the work at the agreed price.</li>
<li>To avoid the inconvenience and potential additional costs of sourcing a new carpenter, Roffey Bros agreed to pay an additional sum per flat completed.</li>
<li>Roffey Bros, despite witnessing Williams continue his work with the understanding of the new agreement, did not pay the promised additional amounts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Issue Raised by the Material Facts:
<ul>
<li>The primary legal question was whether the promise by Roffey Bros to pay more, without any apparent fresh consideration, constituted an enforceable agreement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Precedences:
<ul>
<li>The court revisited Stilk v Myrick (1809), where it was ruled that a party‚Äôs promise to perform a duty they‚Äôre already contractually obligated to perform doesn‚Äôt amount to valid consideration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tests:
<ul>
<li>The court explored if Roffey Bros derived a ‚Äúpractical benefit‚Äù from the revised terms with Williams, even if Williams was only carrying out his existing duty.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Words and Phrases Considered:
<ul>
<li>Key terms assessed included ‚ÄúConsideration‚Äù, ‚ÄúPractical benefit‚Äù, and ‚ÄúEconomic duress‚Äù.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What Each Judge Thought:
<ul>
<li>All judges in the Court of Appeal, while noting the principles from Stilk v Myrick, agreed that in modern commerce, if a party receives a practical benefit from varied terms, even if there‚Äôs no new consideration in the classic sense, that can make the varied terms enforceable.</li>
<li>They recognized the commercial reality and the practical benefit derived by Roffey Bros in ensuring the continued services of Williams.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Legal Reasoning and Ratio of the Case:
<ul>
<li>The court emphasized that the doctrine of consideration shouldn‚Äôt be a tool for injustice.</li>
<li>If one party derives a practical benefit from varied terms, even if those terms merely ensure the performance of an existing duty, such an agreement can be enforceable.</li>
<li>The evolution of business practices and the need for commercial efficacy played a role in this decision.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Result:
<ul>
<li>The Court of Appeal ruled in favor of Williams, holding that Roffey Bros must honor their promise to pay the additional amounts as they derived a genuine practical benefit from the revised agreement.</li>
<li>The potential inconvenience and additional costs they avoided by not having to find a new carpenter were deemed significant.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>Re Selectmove Ltd [1995] 1 WLR 474</p>
<ul>
<li>if the principle from ‚ÄúWilliams v Roffey Bros‚Äù (i.e., a promise to perform an existing contractual obligation can be good consideration if the promisor gains a practical benefit) were extended to the obligation to make payment, it would essentially negate the principle set in ‚ÄúFoakes v Beer.‚Äù
<ul>
<li>Foakes v beer principle: if you owe someone money and they agree to let you pay less to settle the entire debt, that agreement isn‚Äôt enforceable unless there‚Äôs something additional given in return.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Court of Appeal can‚Äôt overrule or sidestep ‚ÄúFoakes v Beer‚Äù based on the principles from ‚ÄúWilliams v Roffey Bros.</li>
<li>Need higher authority to evaluate</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Duty owed to a third party</p>
<ul>
<li>A promise to perform an act which the promisor is under an existing duty to a third party to perform may constitute good consideration.
<ul>
<li>A‚Äôs promise to B to perform a duty which A is already contractually obliged to perform for C
<ul>
<li>May = consideration</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Current Reason for Trial:
<ul>
<li>Challenge to the validity of a guarantee provision under the threat of canceling an existing agreement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Material Facts:
<ul>
<li>Share transfer agreement in question.</li>
<li>Guarantee provision to ensure share price stability.</li>
<li>Threat to cancel a subsidiary agreement unless the guarantee was provided.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Issue Raised by the Material Facts:

<li>‚ÄúPublic Policy‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What Each Judge Thought:</li>
<li>Legal Reasoning and the Ratio of the Case:
<ul>
<li>Contracts formed under coercion of will can be considered voidable.</li>
<li>Mere commercial pressure isn‚Äôt enough for a contract to be voidable.</li>
<li>Upholding the sanctity of contracts unless they‚Äôre undermined by specific factors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Result:
<ul>
<li>Appeal in favor of Pao On and others was allowed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Significance &amp; Precedents Set for the Future:
<ul>
<li>The case of Pao On v Lau Yiu Long is significant for several reasons:
<ul>
<li>Clarification on Consideration: The case delved into the nuances of valid consideration, specifically examining whether fulfilling a pre-existing duty can serve as valid consideration.
<ul>
<li>This establishes a clearer boundary for future commercial transactions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Duress vs. Commercial Pressure: One of the most impactful outcomes of this case was the distinction it drew between contracts formed under genuine duress (coercion of will) and those formed under mere commercial pressure.
<ul>
<li>This ensures that not every aggressive negotiation or hard bargaining situation can be used as grounds to set aside a contract.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Upholding Contract Sanctity: By reinforcing the principle that contracts are to be respected unless there are clear undermining factors, the case sent a strong message about the importance of commercial agreements and the legal system‚Äôs commitment to upholding them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Overall, Pao On v Lau Yiu Long sets important precedents for commercial law, especially in situations where the validity of contracts and agreements is under scrutiny due to external pressures or perceived threats.
<ul>
<li>It provides valuable guidance for future cases where the distinction between genuine duress and mere commercial pressure is in question.</li>

<ul>
<li>Intention
<ul>
<li>The third element of contract formation is that the parties must manifest an intention to create legal relations.
<ul>
<li>parties may reach a clear and certain agreement that satisfies the consideration requirement, but may not be intended to create legal relations:
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Where an agreement is made in a commercial context, a question may arise whether the parties intend to make an honourable, rather than legal commitment.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>The issue may arise in a social or domestic context.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>An agreement to help a friend to move some furniture in return for dinner involves an exchange of promises, but is clearly not intended to be legally binding.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An agreement relating to more substantial matters, such as employment or the sale of valuable property, may be intended to attract legal consequences even when it is made with a close relative.</li>
<li>
<ol start="3">
<li>An issue of intention to contract may arise where an agreement is made between a government and an individual.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The implementation of government policy may, for example, lead a government to reach an agreement with a particular individual to provide some assistance.</li>
<li>The fact that the individual is providing something in return for that assistance does not necessarily mean that the parties intend to make a contract.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="4">
<li>Where parties reach a preliminary agreement, the question may arise whether the parties intend to be bound immediately, or not until some time in the future when the parties have finalised some outstanding issues or recorded their agreement in a more formal manner.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>certain types of agreements are presumed to be intended to be binding, while others are presumed not to be made with such an intention.</li>

</li>
<li>Procedural History:
<ul>
<li>Archbishop Ermogenous initiated the case seeking employment benefits.</li>
<li>The trial court ruled in favor of the Greek Orthodox Community of SA.</li>
<li>The decision was overturned by the Supreme Court of South Australia.</li>
<li>The matter was then appealed to the High Court.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Original Dispute:
<ul>
<li>The primary question was whether there existed a contractual relationship between Archbishop Ermogenous and the Greek Orthodox Community of SA Inc that could give rise to employment benefits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Current Reason for Trial:
<ul>
<li>The appeal before the High Court was to ascertain if such a contractual relationship was legally recognized.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Material Facts:
<ul>
<li>Archbishop Ermogenous received an offer of employment which he accepted.</li>
<li>While their relationship was primarily spiritual, there were stipulated duties and compensations, leading to a contention of whether it was contractual.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Issue Raised by the Material Facts:
<ul>
<li>Does a spiritual calling and relationship exclude the possibility of a legally enforceable contractual relationship?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Precedences:
<ul>
<li>The case referenced precedents such as Rogers v Booth and Lewery v Salvation Army, which dealt with similar issues.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tests:
<ul>
<li>The court looked at the objective intentions of the parties.</li>
<li>They examined if there was a clear offer, acceptance, and consideration that would make up a valid contract.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Words and Phrases Considered:
<ul>
<li>‚ÄúContractual intention‚Äù, ‚Äúspiritual duties‚Äù, ‚Äúenforceable rights‚Äù, ‚Äúoffer‚Äù, ‚Äúacceptance‚Äù, and ‚Äúconsideration‚Äù.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What Each Judge Thought:
<ul>
<li>While nuances between judges‚Äô opinions might exist, the High Court generally acknowledged that a spiritual relationship doesn‚Äôt preclude a legal contract.</li>
<li>They noted that the terms between the Archbishop and the Greek Orthodox Community were more than mere spiritual obligations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Legal Reasoning and Ratio of the Case:
<ul>
<li>The Court emphasized that the determination of a contract doesn‚Äôt rest solely on the nature of the duties (spiritual vs. secular).</li>
<li>It is about the intention of the parties.</li>
<li>If the terms are clear, providing legal rights and duties, it can be considered a contract even if it‚Äôs within a religious context.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Result:
<ul>
<li>The High Court allowed the appeal, meaning they recognized the possibility of a contractual relationship between Archbishop Ermogenous and the Greek Orthodox Community of SA.</li>

<li>Material facts:
<ul>
<li>ANI and Banque Brussels Lambert were involved in a financial negotiation regarding a US$1 million facility.</li>
<li>Upon the bank‚Äôs insistence, this was increased to a US$5 million facility, contingent upon ANI providing a ‚Äúletter of comfort‚Äù to give assurance of the deal‚Äôs soundness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Issue raised by the material facts:
<ul>
<li>Were the statements made in the ‚Äúletter of comfort‚Äù legally enforceable promises?
<ul>
<li>If so, did ANI breach these promises?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Precedences:
<ul>
<li>The court looked to prior decisions like Edwards v Skyways Ltd, Kleinwort Benson [1988] 1 WLR 799, and Chemco Leasing SpA v Redifusion plc.</li>
<li>These cases provided guidance on when seemingly non-binding terms might be enforced and the intent behind such terms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tests:
<ul>
<li>The court sought to identify:
<ul>
<li>If the statements in the ‚Äúletter of comfort‚Äù bore any promissory intent.</li>
<li>Whether ANI and Banque Brussels Lambert had an understanding that these terms were binding.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Words and Phrases Considered:
<ul>
<li>The court scrutinized phrases such as ‚ÄúLetter of comfort,‚Äù evaluating its typical usage in the financial sector.</li>
<li>Additionally, terms like ‚ÄúIntention‚Äù and ‚ÄúPromise‚Äù were analyzed to determine their weight in the given context.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What each judge thought:
<ul>
<li>While individual opinions might have varied in nuance, the judges largely agreed that commercial transactions should not be nullified based on mere semantics.</li>
<li>They leaned towards upholding the weight of commercial intent over strict linguistic interpretation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Legal reasoning and the ratio:
<ul>
<li>The court‚Äôs rationale was underpinned by the notion that commercial bargains, especially those involving significant stakes, should be honored.</li>
<li>If statements within such bargains have a promissory shade, they ought to be seen as binding, barring clear evidence to the contrary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Result:
<ul>
<li>The court found ANI liable, holding that certain statements within the ‚Äúletter of comfort‚Äù bore binding intent and that ANI had breached them.</li>

<ul>
<li>intention to create legal relations.
<ul>
<li>voyage by the plaintiffs to Australia to reside with the defendant at her home.</li>
<li>The discourse touches upon various legal principles surrounding contracts, including:
<ul>
<li>Offer and Acceptance:
<ul>
<li>A contract is formed when there‚Äôs an offer by one party and acceptance by another.</li>
<li>This offer and acceptance can be explicit or implied from conduct or language.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consideration:
<ul>
<li>For a contract to be binding, there must be something of value exchanged between the parties, known as consideration.</li>
<li>Consideration can take many forms such as a right, interest, benefit, or even forbearance or responsibility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Intention:
<ul>
<li>The parties must intend the agreement to be legally binding.</li>
<li>This intention can be explicit or implicit.</li>
<li>Factors like language used, the situation of the parties, and the surrounding circumstances can indicate the presence or absence of such intention.</li>
<li>In some situations, legal enforceability is presumed, especially in business arrangements.</li>
<li>However, in personal or domestic arrangements, such presumption may be doubtful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Certainty:
<ul>
<li>The terms of a contract must be clear.</li>
<li>If the terms are vague, uncertain, or still subject to negotiation, it might be unenforceable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>License:
<ul>
<li>The plaintiffs were given a licence to reside with the defendant.</li>
<li>The text examines the revocability of this licence and the conditions under which it becomes irrevocable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implication of Terms:
<ul>
<li>Sometimes, terms are not explicitly stated but are implied to make the contract operational according to the intention of the parties.</li>
<li>The terms must be necessary to the nature of the contract and directly related to its purpose.</li>

<li>Clarify the procedural history of the case.
<ul>
<li>Appeal from the Supreme Court of Western Australia</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What the original dispute was
<ul>
<li>Cameron (the respondent) and Mr and Mrs Masters (the appellants) signed a document whereby Cameron agreed to sell and the Masters agreed to buy for ¬£17,500 a certain property owned by Cameron.</li>
<li>The purchasers encountered financial difficulties, denied that they were legally bound to purchase the property, and sought to recover the deposit</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Current reason for trial
<ul>
<li>Is the document on its true construction constitutes a binding contract between the respondent and the appellants, or only a record of terms upon which the signatories were agreed as a basis for the negotiation of a contract</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ascertain the material facts
<ul>
<li>Plainly enough they were agreed that there should be a sale and purchase, and the parties, the property, the price, and the date for possession were all clearly settled between them.</li>

<ul>
<li>3 classes of contract in this case:

<li>Everything is ready, but want to have the terms restated in a form which will be fuller or more precise but not different in effect.

<li>Most common</li>
<li>Rossiter v Miller (1878) 3 App Cas 1124,</li>
<li>as soon as the fact is established of the final mutual assent of the parties so that those who draw up the formal agreement have not the power to vary the terms already settled, I think the contract is completed‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Duplicate contract, but made performance of one or more of the terms conditional upon the execution of a formal document.
<ul>
<li>Niesmann v Collingridge (1921) 29 -</li>
<li>Rich and Starke JJ observed that this did not make the signing of a contract a condition of agreement, but made it a condition of the obligation to pay, and carried a necessary implication that each party would sign a contract in accordance with the terms of agreement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Or the intention of the parties is not to make a concluded bargain at all, unless and until they execute a formal contract.

<ul>
<li>certainty and completeness
<ul>
<li>if the parties have entered into a contract, then it must contain enough terms to function properly,</li>
<li>and those terms must be expressed adequately clearly so that a court can enforce them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Introduction
<ul>
<li>How certain do the terms of an agreement have to be before the law will recognise it to be a legally binding contract?
<ul>
<li>Difficult (if not impossible) for parties to anticipate and provide for every contingency.
<ul>
<li>Also can be difficult for parties to articulate themselves so there is only one interpretation and no ambiguity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Raises issues of sufficiency ‚Äî what is sufficiently complete and what is sufficiently certain.</li>
<li>It is fact specific ‚Äî nature of agreement and circumstances in which agreement was made.</li>
<li>Judicial attitudes differ in their opinions as to the degree of certainty and completeness required, and the extent to which the courts should till gaps and resolve ambiguities.</li>
<li>Trend ‚Äî judges increasingly willing to fill gaps and resolve ambiguities (implied terms).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Certainty aspects
<ul>
<li>Sufficiently certain</li>
<li>Sufficiently complete</li>
<li>Promise must NOT Illusory
<ul>
<li>A promise is discretionary - don‚Äôt have to do it</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Completeness Overview
<ul>
<li>Parties must have reached agreement on all of its essential terms.
<ul>
<li>What is an essential term?
<ul>
<li>A term without which the contract cannot be enforced.</li>
<li>A term which only the parties can supply.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Whether an omission is fatal to contract formation depends on three main factors
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>How important or essential is the term that is missing?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Meaning of essentiality in this context: Milne v Attorney-General (Tas) (1956) 95 CLR 460</li>
<li>Whether the courts can fill the gaps by applying an objective or reasonable standard.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>Have the parties turned their mind to the issue?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Why has the term been left out? Was it deliberately left out or was it by mistake?</li>
<li>Agreements to agree are not enforceable. The court will generally not fill the gap in these circumstances.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="3">
<li>Has the agreement been partly executed?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>If one of the parties has already performed all or some of the contract, the courts are less likely to find that an agreement is incomplete (Foley v Classique).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Note: A mechanism or formula can be used to set an essential term, and this will not result in a contract being void for want of certainty.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sufficiently Complete: Essential Terms
<ul>
<li>For a contract to be sufficiently complete, parties must have reached agreement on all essential terms.</li>
<li>Consider: What is an essential term?
<ul>
<li>A term without which the contract cannot be enforced.</li>
<li>A term which only the parties can supply.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Milne v Attorney-General (Tas) (1956) 95 CLR 460 upholds this</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>HOW IMPORTANT / ESSENTIAL IS THE MISSING TERM?
<ul>
<li>The threshold question is whether the parties have specifically agreed on all the terms that only they can decide.</li>
<li>What matters is whether the court can enforce the contract in the absence of the term in question, without exceeding its role as the interpreter, rather than the author, of the contract.</li>
<li>If the parties have failed to agree on essential terms, the court will refuse to find an enforceable contract.</li>
<li>Depends on nature of the contract and circumstances of the case
<ul>
<li>The complexity of the contract and the courts understanding of and familiarity with the type of transaction.</li>
<li>The reason why the parties failed to reach agreement on the issue.</li>
<li>Whether the agreement remains wholly executory or has been wholly or partly</li>
<li>performed on one side.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Examples
<ul>
<li>Lease of land
<ul>
<li>Essential
<ul>
<li>The commencement date,</li>
<li>the rental to be paid,</li>
<li>parties,</li>
<li>subject matter (description of the land)</li>
<li>Without these terms, the agreement for a lease will not be binding</li>
</ul>

<li>Essential
<ul>
<li>the parties,</li>
<li>description of the land</li>
<li>and the price</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Non-essential:
<ul>
<li>Settlement date ‚Äî the court can imply a reasonable settlement date</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sale of goods
<ul>
<li>Essential:
<ul>
<li>the parties</li>
<li>and description of the goods</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Non-essential:
<ul>
<li>a failure to stipulate the price may not be fatal (s.13 Goods Act (NSW))</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What if one party has already performed all or part of the contract?
<ul>
<li>The courts are less likely to find an agreement is incomplete if one party has already performed all or some of the contract.</li>
<li>See the case of Foley v Classique Coaches Ltd (1934) 2 KB 1, which illustrates the court‚Äôs effort to find certain y in a case where there has been some performance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Foley v Classique Coaches Ltd (1934) 2 KB 1
<ul>
<li>Foley and Classique Coaches entered into a written agreement on the 11th April 1930, whereby it was agreed that Foley would sell some of his land to Classique for lbs 1,100.00 (Land Agreement)</li>
<li>This Land Agreement was made subject to a condition that the parties would enter into another contract, the Petrol Supply Agreement on the same day, with the following terms:
<ul>
<li>Foley would sell petrol to Classique at price to be agreed in writing from time to time</li>
<li>The Petrol Agreement was to remain in force during Foley‚Äôs life and his wife‚Äôs</li>
<li>Classique would not buy petrol from anyone else</li>
<li>If any dispute arose regarding the subject matter or construction of the Petrol Supply Agreement, the dispute shall be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Act 1889 (UK)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In accordance with the two Agreements, the land was transferred to Classique and they bought petrol from Foley for 3 years. Then Classique wanted to purchase cheaper petrol elsewhere</li>
<li>Held
<ul>
<li>There was an effective and enforceable contract, although no definite price had been agreed with regard to the future supply of petrol</li>
<li>Key distinction here is that the land had been conveyed and the parties were well into performance of the agreement.
<ul>
<li>3 years into agreement</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>May and Butcher v The King (1934) 2 KB 17
<ul>
<li>May and Butcher entered into a 12 month contract with the Disposals and Liquidation Commission whereby it was agreed that the Commission would sell Old tentage to May and Butcher but the price would be ‚Äúagreed upon from time to time‚Äù (an agreement to agree).
<ul>
<li>The relationship soured and the Commission did not want to continue with the arrangement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>HELD:
<ul>
<li>The price was an essential term and the agreement was void for want of certainty;
<ul>
<li>the parties had agreed to reach agreement on the price in the future, so for the court to imply a reasonable price would be inconsistent with the expressed intentions of the parties, which was to set the price themselves,</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>However, an agreement to agree on an essential term may be enforceable if:
<ul>
<li>The agreement has been partly performed: Foley v Classique Coaches.</li>
<li>A mechanism / formula is specified to supply a term if the parties are unable to reach agreement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Completeness: A mechanism or formula can fill the gap
<ul>
<li>Effective mechanism
<ul>
<li>Parties may make a valid contract that defers agreement on an essential term by providing an effective mechanism for supplying the term in the event they fail to reach agreement.</li>
<li>See eg, the case of George v Roach (1942) 67 CLR 253:
<ul>
<li>George carried on the business of a newsagent and storekeeper.
<ul>
<li>He agreed to sell his business to Spencer.</li>
<li>The contract provided that a valuation of the newspaper agency would be provided by a third party, Mr Solomon, and this valuation would form the basis of the purchase price.</li>
<li>Spencer paid lbs 1,100 on account of the purchase price even though the valuation for not yet taken place.</li>
<li>Mr Solomon refused to undertake the valuation.</li>
<li>Mr Spencer had died by then but his wife, Roach (on behalf of his estate to recover the lbs 1,100 because the contract was void for uncertainty.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The High Court held that an agreement was ineffective when part of the purchase price was to be fixed by a nominated valuer who refused to carry out the task.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Effective formula
<ul>
<li>An alternative is for the parties to agree on a formula for settling an essential term in the event of a dispute
<ul>
<li>(eg: a base sum and a mathematical formula that incorporates reference to changes in the Consumer Price Index to determine increases in rent each year).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The validity of such a contract will then depend on whether the court regards the formula or standard as sufficiently certain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Certainty
<ul>
<li>The main purpose of interpreting terms of a contract is to work out what exactly each party has to do to meet the obligations under it. Interpretation is not always easy</li>
<li>Consider the agreements below:
<ul>
<li>Parties enter into an agreement to build a rear decking. They agree that the ‚Äú‚Ä¶timber used in the must be of high quality‚Äù</li>
<li>Parties enter into an agreement to ‚Äúsupply Coles with fresh eggs‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What do these terms mean?</li>
<li>Court‚Äôs approach to a particular term that is vague or imprecise
<ul>
<li>Not a pedantic test ‚Äî some ambiguity is acceptable:
<ul>
<li>Council of the Upper Hunter v Aust Chilling and Freezing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Whether an objective standard (where available) can be relied on or implied to save a clause. Courts are often divided as to this approach
<ul>
<li>Biotechnology v Pace (Note: this case also raises issues of illusory promises)</li>
<li>Whitlock v Brew</li>
<li>Hall v Busst</li>
<li>Meehan v Jones</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Uncertainty of meaning is more likely to affect validity if the parties have yet to perform</li>
<li>Agreements to negotiate in good faith are not necessarily too uncertain:
<ul>
<li>United Group Rail v Rail Corp</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Certainty of meaning
<ul>
<li>Court‚Äôs approach to a term that is vague or imprecise
<ul>
<li>The terms must not be vague and imprecise such that the courts cannot attribute sufficiently precise meaning to them.</li>
<li>Courts do not usually take a narrow approach to the requirement of certainty, and will attribute a meaning to the language used by the parties unless it is impossible to do so.</li>
<li>As with incompleteness, uncertainty is more likely to affect a contract that remains wholly executory.</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Council of the Upper Hunter County District v Australian Chilling &amp; Freezing (1968) 118 CLR 429
<ul>
<li>The Council contracted to sell electricity to Australian Chilling and Freezing (‚ÄúACF‚Äù)</li>
<li>Clause 5 of the agreement provided as follows:
<ul>
<li>It is agreed that during the term of this agreement if the supplier‚Äôs [Council‚Äôs] costs shall vary in other respects than has been hereinbefore provided the supplier [Council] shall have the right to vary the maximum demand charge and the energy charge by notice in writing to the purchaser [ACF]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The agreement also provided for arbitration in the event of a dispute between the parties</li>
<li>Council sought to increase their charges pursuant to clause 5</li>
<li>ACF argued that clause 5, in particular its reference to supplier‚Äôs costs varying, was uncertain and unenforceable</li>
<li>language employed by parties was not ‚Äúso obscure and so incapable of any definite or precise meaning that the court is unable to attribute to the parties any particular contractual intention‚Äù, the contract cannot be held to be uncertain to be void or meaningless</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implying Objective Standards
<ul>
<li>Standards of reasonableness and fairness (and similar concepts) are sometimes employed as terms of a contract expressly by the parties or implied by the courts to make a contract complete. Parties might use terms such as:
<ul>
<li>‚Äúa reasonable price for the goods‚Äù</li>
<li>‚Äúa fair and equitable price for her services‚Äù</li>
<li>‚Äúprice to be set at fair market value‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>These concepts are inherently imprecise but the question is whether they are uncertain.</li>
<li>The courts will endeavour to give those terms meaning in order to uphold a contract.</li>
<li>In some cases, what is reasonable or fair will not be sufficiently certain because it may be impossible to work out what it means.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Whitlock v Brew (1968) 118 CLR 445
<ul>
<li>What are the facts?
<ul>
<li>The difficulty that the court had to deal with was what does the term ‚Äúupon such reasonable terms as commonly govern a lease‚Äù in clause 5 actually mean?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Kitto J held:
<ul>
<li>The expression ‚Äòupon such reasonable terms as commonly govern a lease would have been sufficiently certain had there been an ascertainable set of terms in common use</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The result was that there was no consensus between the parties about key terms, such as the term of the lease, the rent</li>
<li>The arbitration clause would assist if there was a dispute as to what terms are reasonable and common to such a lease if such terms actually existed</li>
<li>The arbitration clause did not authorise an arbitrator to force on the purchaser such terms that the arbitrator might think are reasonable and ought commonly govern such a lease because to do so would alter the contract</li>
<li>Court concluded that clause 5 had no contractual effect, which resulted in the whole contract being rendered void</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hall v Busst (1960) 104 CLR 206
<ul>
<li>Hall and Busst agreed that Hall would purchase Busst‚Äôs land and chattels on an island, known as Bedarra Island for ¬£3.157</li>
<li>The agreement provided that:
<ul>
<li>Hall could not re-sell the land without first obtaining Busst‚Äôs consent</li>
<li>Such consent would be obtained by Hall giving notice to Busst of her intention to resell the land and Busst would have the option of repurchasing</li>
<li>Clause 5 stated: ‚Äúthe purchase price shall be the sum of ¬£3.157 4s 0d to which shall be added the value of all additions and improvements to the said property since the date of purchase‚Ä¶and from which shall be subtracted the value of the deficiencies in chattel property and a reasonable sum to cover depreciation of all buildings and property on the land.‚Äù</li>
<li>Hall sold the land and chattels to a third party for ¬£8,500 without giving notice to Busst</li>
<li>Busst sued Hall for breach of contract. Hall argued that the price clause in the option was void for uncertainty</li>
<li>The High Court held that the option was not enforceable because the price was uncertain</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>‚Äúthe value of all additions and improvements‚Äù is not sufficiently certain to give rise to an enforceable contract because there could be no external standard of value of additions and improvements to the island. There was nothing to compare it to, no external standard</li>
<li>‚ÄúThe value of all deficiencies‚Äù was uncertain in the ascertainment of the price
<ul>
<li>No external standard to assess what ‚Äúdepreciation of all other buildings and other property on the land‚Äù meant</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Certainty &amp; Agreements to negotiate
<ul>
<li>Contracts sometimes contain clauses as follows:
<ul>
<li>Parties must ‚Äònegotiate in good faith‚Äô the precise terms of a more comprehensive joint venture agreement</li>
<li>Parties must ‚Äòundertake genuine and good faith negotiations with a view to resolving disputes‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Such concepts such as ‚Äònegotiation‚Äô, ‚Äòmediation‚Äô and ‚Äògood faith‚Äô are inherently subjective, but the issue is whether they are enforceable
<ul>
<li>UK: these agreements cannot be legally binding on the basis that they are too uncertain to enforce</li>
<li>Australia: courts have been a bit more flexible and have tried to give such agreements some meaning, but it depends on the precise terms used. The Court looks for a promise that is sufficiently clear</li>

<li>United Group Rail Services Ltd v Rail Corporation NSW (2009) 74 NSWLR 618
<ul>
<li>
<p>United Group and Rail Corp entered into a contract whereby it was agreed that</p>
<ul>
<li>United Group would design and build new rolling stock for Rail Corp,.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clause 35 of the contract provided a dispute resolution clause.</p>
<ul>
<li>Part of the clause provided that if the dispute is referred to a senior representative of each party, they must meet and undertaken genuine and good faith negotiations with a view to resolving the dispute or difference.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>United Group argued that this clause was too uncertain and was therefore void and unenforceable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Held:</p>
<ul>
<li>The court held that their task is to give effect to business contracts where there is a meaning capable of being ascribed to a word or term or phrase.</li>
<li>Genuineness and good faith are not empty obligations.</li>
<li>Resolving a dispute ‚Äòrequires an honest and genuine attempt to resolve differences by discussion, and if thought to be reasonable and appropriate, by compromise, in the context of showing a faithfulness and fidelity to the existing bargain</li>

<li>ILLUSORY PROMISES &amp; CONSEQUENCES OF UNCERTAINTY
<ul>
<li>Certainty &amp; Illusory promises
<ul>
<li>A contract will be illusory if a party gives an unfettered discretion as to performance of a promise
<ul>
<li>What does unfettered mean?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the legal status of an illusory promise?
<ul>
<li>Placer Developments Ltd v Commonwealth (1969) 121 CLR 353</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A term will not be illusory where:
<ul>
<li>A party is given a latitude of choice which does not amount to complete and unfettered discretion
<ul>
<li>See Meehan v Jones (1982) 149 CLR 571</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The discretion relates to the fulfilment of a condition upon which the performance of the contract depends (ie there is no discretion as to the performance of the contract once the condition is satisfied)
<ul>
<li>See Meehan v Jones (1982) 149 CLR 571</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The discretion is exercised by a third party
<ul>
<li>Godecke v Kirwan (1973) 129 CLR 629</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Legal status of an illusory promise
<ul>
<li>Recognised general principle
<ul>
<li>Placer Developments Ltd v Commonwealth (1969) 121 CLR 353, 356 (Kitto J):
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòWherever words which by themselves constitute a promise are accompanied by words showing that the promisor is to have a discretion or option as to whether he will carry out that which purports to be the promise, the result is that there is no contract on which an action can be brought at all.‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are two ways of conceptualising this:
<ul>
<li>No consideration: an illusory promise is no promise at all (recall Australian Woollen Mills case).</li>
<li>Incomplete contract: an essential term has been left to be determined by one party.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Placer Developments Ltd v Commonwealth (1969) 121 CLR 353
<ul>
<li>Clause 14 of the Agreement stated that if customs duty had to be paid on the imported products and not remitted, ‚Äúthe Commonwealth will pay to the Timber Company a subsidy upon the exportation of these products from the Territory ‚Ä¶ of an amount or at a rate determined by the Commonwealth from time to time but the amount of subsidy paid shall not exceed the amount of customs duty paid and not remitted‚Äù</li>
<li>Kitto J held:
<ul>
<li>In this case (with specific reference to clause 14), the Commonwealth‚Äôs promise to pay an unspecified sum of money was illusory, since the Commonwealth was expressly given a discretion to determine the amount to be paid.</li>
<li>A promise to pay a governmental subsidy is meaningless in the absence of a specification of some amount or some basis of calculation.
<ul>
<li>That promise carries no implication that at least a reasonable subsidy shall be paid, for there is no general standard of reasonableness with respect to the quantum of a subsidy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A term will not be illusory where:
<ul>
<li>A party is given a latitude of choice, which does not amount to complete and unfettered discretion</li>
<li>The discretion relates to the fulfilment of a condition upon which the performance of the contract depends, so there is no discretion as to the performance of the contract once the condition is satisfied</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Meehan v Jones (1982) 149 CLR 571
<ul>
<li>The parties entered into a written agreement for the sale of land (an oil refinery) for a price of $800,000.00</li>
<li>The contract was subject to two conditions:
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Purchaser or his nominee entering into a satisfactory Agreement or arrangement with Ampol Petroleum Limited for the supply of a satisfactory quantity of crude oil</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>Purchaser or his nominee receiving approval for finance on satisfactory terms and conditions in an amount sufficient to complete the purchase hereunder;</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>and should either of the above conditions not be satisfied on or before 31 July 1979 (or such extended time as the</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>parties may agree upon) then this Contract (other than for the provisions of this Clause) shall be null and void</li>
<li>On 23 July, Jones sold the land to a 3rd party</li>
<li>On 30 July, Meehan advised Jones that both conditions had been satisfied. Meehan sought specific performance of the contract</li>
<li>The trial judge and the Full Court of the Supreme Court refused specific performance on the basis that the contract was void for uncertainty.
<ul>
<li>Meehan then appealed to the High Court</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CERTAINTY in Meehan v Jones
<ul>
<li>Where the words of a condition state that a contract is subject to finance, the question immediately arises whether the test to be applied is a subjective or objective.</li>
<li>In either case, the purchaser does not have absolute discretion.</li>
<li>The fact that opinions may differ as to which of these two meanings is given to the words of the clause does not mean that the clause is uncertain.</li>
<li>In considering whether the objective / subjective approach applied, the court said that unless a clause of this kind makes a clear indication to the contrary, its natural effect is to leave it to the:
<ul>
<li>purchaser to be [subjectively] satisfied, not some hypothetical reasonable man.</li>
<li>it may be implied that the purchaser will act honestly in deciding whether or not he is satisfied.</li>
<li>but it is not necessary to imply that the purchase will make reasonable efforts to obtain finance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ILLUSORY PROMISE in Meehan v Jones
<ul>
<li>Although there is nothing uncertain about a clause which speaks of [subjective] satisfaction of purchase, could it still be illusory?</li>
<li>There is a well settled principle that when ‚Äúthe promisor is to have a discretion or option as to whether he will carry out that which purports to, be the promise, the result is that there is no contract‚Äù</li>
<li>A contract is illusory where one of the parties has a discretion as to whether to perform the contract, but not where one of the parties has a discretion in relation to the fulfilment of a condition on which the contract depends.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Meehan v Jones (1982) (cont‚Äôd)
<ul>
<li>To say that a ‚Äúsubject to finance‚Äù or ‚Äúsubject to finance on satisfactory terms and conditions‚Äù clause denotes finance which is satisfactory to the purchaser is not to say that he has an absolute or unfettered right to decide what is satisfactory.</li>
<li>With some justification the vendor can claim that the agreement is a binding contract which relieves the purchaser from performance only in the event that, acting honestly, or honestly and reasonably, he is unable to obtain suitable finance.</li>
<li>There is in this formulation no element of uncertainty - the courts are quite capable of deciding whether the purchaser is acting honestly and reasonably.</li>
<li>Because the purchaser must act honestly, or honestly and reasonably, it is not a case where the purchaser has an unfettered discretion as to what constitutes finance on satisfactory terms
<ul>
<li>‚Äì the decision must be reached honestly, or honestly and reasonably.</li>
<li>Just because there is some discretion, does not make it unfettered</li>
<li>In this case, it is a condition, not a term</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Accordingly, the promise is not illusory</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Godecke v Kirwan (1973) 129 CLR 629
<ul>
<li>The parties signed a document headed ‚ÄòOffer and Acceptance‚Äô setting out terms they agreed to for the sale and purchase of land. The agreement provided for a promise by the purchaser to execute, if required to do so, a further agreement in accordance with cl.6</li>
<li>Cl. 6 provided that if a formal agreement was required, it would be prepared by the vendor‚Äôs solicitors containing ‚Äúthe foregoing and such other covenants and conditions as they may reasonably require‚Äù</li>
<li>Kirwan refused to go ahead and transfer the land. He argued the agreement was illusory because they would be bound by the subsequent formal agreement drawn up by solicitors containing other terms and that conferred on them an unfettered discretion</li>
<li>Walsh J: the clause should be construed as limited to permitting the insertion of covenants and conditions not inconsistent with those contained in the offer. It was also limited by a standard of reasonableness, determined objectively so it did not confer an unfettered discretion on the solicitors</li>
<li>What did Gibbs J say?</li>

</li>
<li>Biotechnology Australia Pty Ltd v Pace (1988) 15 NSWLR 130 (Court of Appeal) - scheme one day‚Ä¶ somehow somewhere
<ul>
<li>Dr Pace was a scientist and he entered into an employment contract with a company called Biotechnology.</li>
<li>The contract provided that Dr Pace would receive a salary of $36,000 per annum, a company car and an option to participate in the Company‚Äôs senior staff equity sharing scheme.</li>
<li>Dr Pace was aware that at the time he accepted the offer of employment the Scheme didn‚Äôt exist but the company had plans to introduce it.
<ul>
<li>When his employment was terminated, he sued the company for damages for its failure to give him the option of participating in the equity sharing scheme.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Relevant issues before the Court:
<ul>
<li>Was the disputed clause so uncertain that it cannot be enforced?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Was the disputed clause so devoid of meaning and so dependent upon the initiatives and decision of Biotechnology Australia as to be illusory?</li>
<li>Kirby J - Uncertainty
<ul>
<li>Kirby J made some general observations about the task of courts in trying to resolve uncertainty in contracts.
<ul>
<li>Every case depends upon its own facts. The meaning of an agreement must be discovered objectively.
<ul>
<li>If there is ambiguity or vagueness, regard to extrinsic evidence might give meaning to the term</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Courts will try to uphold the agreements and avoid frustrating the wishes of the parties, but only so far as those wishes may be ascertained from the agreement between them</li>
<li>Courts will not uphold agreements where the court is asked to spell out to an unacceptable extent that which the parties have themselves failed to agree;
<ul>
<li>clarify that which is too obscure and accept for itself a discretion which the parties by their agreement reserved to one of both of them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Judges will differ in opinion about whether a court can give effect to an uncertain term and there is no objectively right decision in such cases.</li>
<li>The decisions are based on the features of the agreement, the relationship between the parties and relevant external reference points in order to resolve an uncertain term</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Application of legal principles to the facts
<ul>
<li>Was the disputed clause so uncertain of content that it could not be enforced?
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòIt was nonetheless void for uncertainty because the challenged term contained within it too many elements which are uncertain‚Ä¶the bare bones of the promise to establish such a scheme leave too mant decisions to be made for a court to attempt to give content to the promise by substituting its opinion of a fair scheme‚Ä¶</li>
<li>There are too many features of apparent peculiarity in which schemes ‚Ä¶
<ul>
<li>to make it safe to conclude that an objectively ascertainable external standard exists.‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The court found that there were too many elements which were uncertain such as:
<ul>
<li>How many shares in Biotech were to be devoted to the scheme?</li>
<li>What class of shares were to be held by the likes of Pace?</li>
<li>What were the terms of the options upon which the shares would issue?</li>
<li>What rights would attach to the shares?</li>
<li>Upon what terms were they acquired and could they be disposed of?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There were too many gaps to fill in which the parties themselves did not fill, and in this basis the term was unenforceable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Application of legal principles to the facts
<ul>
<li>Was the disputed clause so devoid of meaning and so dependent upon the initiatives and decisions of Biotechnology Australia as to be illusory?
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe problem for the court is that the term is just too uncertain of content.‚Äô</li>
<li>The ‚Äòfulfilment of the term relating to the equity sharing scheme depended upon the decision of one party, namely Biotechnology.</li>
<li>There was no external standard to fix an ‚Äúappropriate‚Äù or ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù equity participation scheme.‚Äô</li>
<li>The ‚Äòexistence of other schemes in other companies with other products and other scientists provides no such reference point‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Biotechnology Australia Pty Ltd v Pace (1988) 15 NSWLR 130 (Court of Appeal)
<ul>
<li>McHugh JA (applied similar reasoning to Kirby P):
<ul>
<li>The promise is too illusory or too vague and uncertain to be enforceable.</li>
<li>The parties recognised that Biotech would decide both the nature of the scheme and the rights of the individuals participating in it.</li>
<li>There is no standard by which a court could determine in any meaningful sense whether such a promise was broken.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hope JA (dissent):
<ul>
<li>Biotech was required to give Pace an option on terms which it had honestly arrived at.</li>
<li>The role of staff equity sharing schemes in employment contracts is sufficiently well established to enable courts to apply the concept of reasonableness to them.</li>
<li>The schemes are more complex than bonuses but that merely makes the resolution of the problem more difficult;
<ul>
<li>it does not deny the possibility of resolution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Concluded that the promise was valid - ‚Äô‚Ä¶ in my opinion the proper conclusion at this stage of the hearing is that as there was a valid and enforceable contractual promise on the part of Biotech to establish a senior staff equity sharing scheme and that the promise was not unenforceable for uncertainty or as being illusory‚Ä¶‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consequences of uncertainty
<ul>
<li>If the terms of an agreement are incomplete, uncertain or illusory, the consequences that can flow include:
<ul>
<li>The whole agreement is VOID
<ul>
<li>If the terms of an agreement are incomplete, uncertain or illusory, the courts look at how essential the term is and the intention of the parties in order to determine whether the entire agreement is void.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SEVERANCE ‚Äì the ineffective term can be severed from the rest of the agreement
<ul>
<li>The problematic term can be severed from the rest of the agreement, and the remaining terms are able to be performed and enforced.</li>
<li>The court will take into account the essentiality of the term and whether severing it is consistent with the intention of the parties.
<ul>
<li>If severing the clause changes the agreement into something the parties did not agree to, the court will not allow that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Eg: Whitlock v Brew: If the court had severed clause 5 of the contract, it would have turned the sale into something different from what the parties contemplated</li>

<li>Description: ‚Äútwenty-four acres of land, freehold, and all appurtenances thereto, at Totmonslow, in the parish of Draycott, in the county of Stafford.‚Äù
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòI think Mr. Plant means he is selling ‚Äúthe twenty-four acres we have been looking at,‚Äù or ‚Äúmy twenty-four acres.‚Äù</li>
<li>It is not twenty-four acres of land anywhere in England, but the place, the county, and the parish are all mentioned. ‚Ä¶ Assuming that the parol evidence comes up to what has been stated, the result would be this: that Mr. Plant had twenty-four acres lying within the metes and bounds sufficiently defined; and if the fact be ascertained that he had no other twenty-four acres that would answer that description, then there would be simply the laying the contract alongside that fact, and the result will be ascertained ‚Äî namely, that the twenty-four acres lying within the metes and bounds was the property that was intended to be included in this description.‚Äô (Chitty J, 290)</li>

<li>(b) The following requirements imposed under a law of this jurisdiction can generally be met in electronic form:
<ul>
<li>i. a requirement to give information in writing,</li>
<li>ii. a requirement to provide a signature,</li>
<li>iii. a requirement to produce a document,</li>
<li>iv. a requirement to record information,</li>
<li>v. a requirement to retain a document.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Section 7 ‚Äì Validity of electronic transactions
<ul>
<li>(1) For the purposes of a law of this jurisdiction, a transaction is not invalid because it took place wholly or partly by means of one or more electronic communications.</li>
<li>(2) The general rule in subsection (1) does not apply in relation to the validity of a transaction to the extent to which another, more specific, provision of this Part deals with the validity of the transaction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Section 9 ‚Äì Signatures
<ul>
<li>(1) If, under a law of this jurisdiction, the signature of a person is required, that requirement is taken to have been met in relation to an electronic communication if:
<ul>
<li>(a) a method is used to identify the person and to indicate the person‚Äôs intention in respect of the information communicated, and</li>
<li>(b) the method used was either:
<ul>
<li>(i) as reliable as appropriate for the purpose for which the electronic communication was generated or communicated, in the light of all the circumstances, including any relevant agreement, or</li>
<li>(ii) proven in fact to have fulfilled the functions described in paragraph (a), by itself or together with further evidence, and (c) the person to whom the signature is required to be given consents to that requirement being met by way of the use of the method mentioned in paragraph (a).

<li>‚Ä¶</li>
<li>(6) If a contract is provided in electronic form, all other documents that are required to be attached to the contract, or provided before completion of the contract, may, despite any other provision in this Act or the regulations, also be provided in electronic form if the document is clearly legible in that form.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Section 54A ‚Äì Contracts for sale etc of land to be in writing
<ul>
<li>(1) No action or proceedings may be brought upon any contract for the sale or other disposition of land or any interest in land, unless the agreement upon which such action or proceedings is brought, or some memorandum or note thereof, is in writing, and signed by the party to be charged or by some other person thereunto lawfully authorised by the party to be charged.</li>
<li>‚Ä¶</li>
<li>(4) A contract referred to in subsection (1) is not invalidated or rendered unenforceable only because it has been created in electronic form and electronically signed or attested.</li>

<li>PAROL EVIDENCE RULE:Summarised
<ul>
<li>Masterton Homes Pty Ltd v Palm Assets Pty Ltd (2009) 261 ALR 382
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe principles that are applicable in deciding whether an agreement that parties have entered is one that is wholly in writing, or partly written and partly oral, include the following: ‚Ä¶ 401 [90] (Campbell JA)
<ul>
<li>‚Äò(1) When there is a document that on its face appears to be a complete contract, that provides an evidentiary basis for inferring that the document contains the whole of the express contractual terms that bind the parties: ‚Ä¶‚Äô 401 [90] (Campbell JA)</li>
<li>‚Äò(2) It is open to a party to prove that, even though there is a document that on its face appears to be a complete contract, the parties have agreed orally on terms additional to those contained in the writing: ‚Ä¶
<ul>
<li>Conversely, it is open to a party to prove that the parties have orally agreed that a document should contain the whole of the terms agreed between them: ‚Ä¶‚Äô 401 [90] (Campbell JA)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>‚Äò(3) The parol evidence rule applies only to contracts that are wholly in writing, and thus has no scope to operate until it has first been ascertained that the contract is wholly in writing: ‚Ä¶‚Äô 402 [90] (Campbell JA)</li>
<li>‚Äò(4) Where a contract is partly written and partly oral, the terms of the contract are to be ascertained from the whole of the circumstances as a matter of fact: ‚Ä¶‚Äô</li>
<li>‚Äò(5) In determining what are the terms of a contract that is partly written and partly oral, surrounding circumstances may be used as an aid to finding what the terms of the contract are:
<ul>
<li>‚Ä¶ If it is possible to make a finding about what were the words the parties said to each other, the meaning of those words is ascertained in the light of the surrounding circumstances: ‚Ä¶
If it is not possible to make a finding about the particular words that were used (as sometimes happens when a contract is partly written, partly oral and partly inferred from conduct) the surrounding circumstances can be looked at to find what in substance the parties agreed:‚Äô</li>

<li>Clause expressly excluded terms being implied into the agreement.</li>
<li>Ordinarily, the Sale of Goods Act would imply a warranty that the machine was fit for purpose.</li>

<li>Toll damaged the vaccines while transporting / storing them.</li>
<li>Was cl 6 (exclusion clause) part of the contract?</li>

</li>
<li>Alphapharm argued:

<li>Unaware that a ‚ÄòCredit application‚Äô document would contain terms on conditions of delivery.</li>
<li>Toll had not brought the ‚Äòunusual‚Äô terms in it to its attention before signing.</li>
</ul>

<li>In this case:

</ul>
</li>
<li>Test
<ul>
<li>Ordinary Meaning: The words used in a contract should be given their natural and ordinary meaning unless such a reading would lead to an absurd result.</li>
<li>Context is Key: The context in which a term is used within the contract and the overall purpose of the contract play a significant role in its interpretation.</li>
<li>Commercial Sense: The interpretation should make commercial sense, especially when interpreting commercial contracts.</li>

<li>L Schuler AG v Wickman Machine Tool Sales Ltd [1974] AC 235

<li>‚ÄòThe general rule is that extrinsic evidence is not admissible for the construction of a written contract; the parties‚Äô intention must be ascertained, on legal principles of construction, from the words they have used.

<li>261 (Lord Wilberforce</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li>‚Äòadditional costs and expenses which they may incur in regard to the surface of the Domain above or in the vicinity of the parking station and the footway and which arise out of the construction operation and maintenance of the parking station by the Lessee.‚Äô</li>
<li>The Council argued that cl 4(b) exhaustively listed what the Trustees could consider when revising the rent.</li>
<li>High Court considered surrounding circumstances:
<ul>
<li>Legislative background that established the parties.</li>
<li>History of dealings up until lease executed in 1972.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>‚Äò(a) the parties to the transaction were two public authorities;</li>
<li>(b) the primary purpose of the transaction was to provide a public facility, not a profit;</li>
<li>(c) the lessee was responsible for the substantial cost of construction of the facility;</li>
<li>(d) the facility was to be constructed under the lessor‚Äôs land and would not interfere with the continued public enjoyment of that land for its primary object, recreation;</li>
<li>(e) the parties‚Äô concern was to protect the lessor from financial disadvantage from the transaction; and</li>
<li>(f) the only financial disadvantage to the lessor which the parties identified related to additional expense which it would or might incur immediately or in the future.‚Äô 53 [11]

<li>Facts
<ul>
<li>Delco retained Darlington to trade on the futures market on its behalf.</li>
<li>Written contract contained:</li>
<li>Exclusion clause</li>
<li>Limitation of liability clause.</li>
<li>Darlington five principles for exclusions
<ul>
<li>Natural and ordinary means</li>
<li>In light of the contract as a whole</li>
<li>Context of the market</li>
<li>Nature and object of the contract</li>
<li>Where appropriate use contra preferentum</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Clause 6 (Exclusion clause):</li>
<li>‚ÄòThe Client ‚Ä¶ acknowledges that the Agent will not be responsible for any loss arising in any way out of any trading activity undertaken on behalf of the Client whether pursuant to this Agreement or not</li>
<li>Clause 7(c) (Limitation clause):</li>
<li>‚ÄòAny liability on the Agent‚Äôs part ‚Ä¶ for damages for or in respect of any claim arising out of or in connection with the relationship established by this agreement or any conduct under it or any orders or instructions given to the Agent by the Client ‚Ä¶ shall not in any event (and whether or not such liability results from or involves negligence) exceed one hundred dollars.‚Äô</li>
<li>Delco authorised Darlington to enter ‚Äòday trading‚Äô transactions, that should have been ‚Äòclosed out‚Äô within 24-hour of entering them.</li>
<li>Darlington breached the contract by not closing out certain transactions within 24 hours.</li>
<li>Caused Delco loss of $280,000.</li>
<li>Darlington relied on Cl 6 and 7(c) to exclude/limit liability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Clause 6 (Exclusion clause) did not totally exclude liability.</li>
<li>‚ÄòThe Client ‚Ä¶ acknowledges that the Agent will not be responsible for any loss arising in any way out of any trading activity undertaken on behalf of the Client whether pursuant to this Agreement or not .</li>
<li>Clause 7(c) (Limitation clause) did limit liability.</li>
<li>‚ÄòAny liability on the Agent‚Äôs part ‚Ä¶ for damages for or in respect of any claim arising out of or in connection with the relationship established by this agreement or any conduct under it or any orders or instructions given to the Agent by the Client ‚Ä¶ shall not in any event (and whether or not such liability results from or involves negligence) exceed one hundred dollars.‚Äô</li>
<li>Interpretation
<ul>
<li>Natural and Ordinary Meaning: Both the sign and the ticket seem to exclude liability quite broadly. The wording covers damages, losses, or injuries and doesn‚Äôt limit the scope of incidents from which the car park seeks to exclude its liability.</li>
<li>Contra Proferentem: If any ambiguity were found in the clauses, the interpretation should not favor Lodge Carpark.</li>

<p>TL;DR</p>
<ul>
<li>Darlington is the leading modern authority on construing exclusion clauses.</li>
<li>Construe exclusion clauses using the ordinary principles of construction.</li>
<li>If the clause is ambiguous, then it may be construed contra proferentum.</li>

<li>
<p>Implied terms</p>
<ul>
<li>INTRODUCTION
<ul>
<li>Implied terms are as valid as express terms:</li>
<li>Damages can be awarded for breach.</li>
<li>Right to terminate may be conferred if the implied term is a condition.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hart v MacDonald (1910) 10 CLR 417
<ul>
<li>an implication is as much a part of a contract as any term couched in express words.‚Äô (430, Isaacs J)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Courts cautiously find implied terms as they do not want to rewrite the contract.</li>
<li>Exception: Legislation may provide that it cannot be contracted out of.</li>
<li>Servcorp WA Pty Ltd v Perron Investments Pty Ltd (2016) 50 WAR 226
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe requirement that an alleged implied term not ‚Äòcontradict‚Äô any express term plainly includes a direct contradiction.</li>
<li>However, the requirement has a broader connotation.</li>
<li>For example, a term cannot be implied if it is apparent, on the face of the document, that the parties adverted to the point in question and either deliberately rejected it or deliberately refrained from dealing with it.‚Äô (257, Buss</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hart v MacDonald (1910) 10 CLR 417
<ul>
<li>‚Äò[An entire agreement clause] excludes what is extraneous to the written contract: but it does not in terms exclude implications arising on a fair construction of the agreement itself, and in the absence of definite exclusion, an implication is as much a part of a contract as any term couched in express words.‚Äô (430, Isaacs J)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the court will not find the implied term then there is a gap in the contract.
<ul>
<li>One party will likely wear the loss / inconvenience.</li>
<li>Contract may fail:
<ul>
<li>Uncertain / incomplete</li>
<li>Frustrated.</li>

<ul>
<li>INTRO
<ul>
<li>Leading case: BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings (1977) 180 CLR 266.</li>
<li>5 criteria aid in identifying implied terms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>NATURE
<ul>
<li>Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of NSW(1982) 149 CLR 337</li>
<li>with implication the term is one which it is presumed that the parties would have agreed upon had they turned their minds to it ‚Äî it is not a term that they have actually agreed upon.‚Äô 346 (Mason J)</li>
<li>Finding implied terms risks making a court an author.</li>
<li>The court mitigates this risk by:
<ul>
<li>Viewing implication of terms as part of the process of construction (ie, discerning the parties‚Äô intentions from express terms.)</li>
<li>Imposing high barriers to the implication of terms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>NECESSARY FOR BUSINESS EFFICACY
<ul>
<li>The Moorcock (1889) 14 PD 64
<ul>
<li>Plaintiff shipowner moored at a jetty of defendant wharf-owner.</li>
<li>Both parties knew that the ship would rest on Thames riverbed at low tide.
<ul>
<li>Ship was damaged when it rested on hard ridge in the riverbed.</li>
<li>Plaintiff argued that there was an implied term that the ship could safely moor at the jetty at low tide.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Both parties knew that the ship would rest on the riverbed at low tide.</li>
<li>It was obvious that no shipowner would moor at an unsafe jetty.
<ul>
<li>Only the defendants could discover whether the riverbed was safe and take steps to make it safe.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Therefore, they impliedly promised either that:
<ul>
<li>It was safe to moor at the jetty; or</li>
<li>That they would warn the plaintiff if it was not safe.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<li>Sekisui Rib Loc Australia Pty Ltd v Rocla Pty Ltd (2012) 291 ALR 140
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe necessity to give ‚Äúbusiness efficacy‚Äù contemplates a term needed ‚Äúin order to make the agreement work, or conversely, in order to avoid an unworkable situation‚Äù.</li>
<li>This is a consideration of what would make the contract workable in a business sense.

<li>A term may be commercially necessary notwithstanding that the contract can operate without it.‚Äô 153 [50] (Sulan J)</li>

<li>REASONABLE AND EQUITABLE
<ul>
<li>BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings (1977) 180 CLR 266
<ul>
<li>BP (Westernport) entered a rate agreement with the Shire of Hastings for the construction and operation of a refinery in the local government area.</li>
<li>The agreement required significant capital investment by BP (Westernport) and performance of obligations for at least 20 years.
<ul>
<li>The Council promised reduced rates for at least 40 years.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After a few years, BP (Westernport) was wound up.
<ul>
<li>Another company in the BP group assumed control of the refinery.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Council levied the new BP company with full rates.
<ul>
<li>Council argued that the rates agreement contained an implied term that the contract would terminate if BP (Westernport) ceased occupying the refinery.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The term was not reasonable and equitable:
<ul>
<li>Council had enjoyed significant economic benefits from the development of the refinery.</li>
<li>Council induced the BP group to invest based on the promised 40-year rate reduction.</li>
<li>Foreseeable that the BP group might restructure in that period.</li>
<li>It made no difference to the Council which of the group operated the refinery.</li>

<li>OBVIOUSNESS AND CLARITY
<ul>
<li>Shirlaw v Southern Foundries (1926) Ltd [1939] 2 KB 206
<ul>
<li>Prima facie that which in any contract is left to be implied and need not be expressed is something so obvious that it goes without saying;
<ul>
<li>so that, if while the parties were making their bargain, an officious bystander were to suggest some express provision for it in the agreement, they would testily suppress him with a common, ‚ÄòOh, of course‚Äô.‚Äô 227 (MacKinnon LJ)</li>

<li>CLARITY
<ul>
<li>Servcorp WA Pty Ltd v Perron Investments Pty Ltd (2016) 50 WAR 226
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe requirement that an alleged implied term be capable of clear expression overlaps with the requirement of obviousness.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings (1977) 180 CLR 266
<ul>
<li>for a term to be implied, the following conditions (which may overlap) must be satisfied (BP Refinery Test loosley):</li>
<li>Implied term interpretation construction loosley:</li>
<li>Formal term interpretation construction strictly:
<ul>
<li>(1) it must be reasonable and equitable;</li>
<li>(2) it must be necessary to give business efficacy (got to make it work) to the contract, so that no term will be implied if the contract is effective without it;</li>
<li>(3) it must be so obvious that ‚Äúit goes without saying‚Äù;</li>
<li>(4) it must be capable of clear expression;</li>
<li>(5) it must not contradict any express term of the contract.‚Äô 282-3 (Lord Simon of Glaisdale for the majority)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Apply the BP Refinery test (all 5 conditions) when implying a term into a formal contract.</li>
<li>The conditions overlap ‚Äî you may find that you repeat arguments to prove several of them.</li>

</li>
<li>INFORMAL AGREEMENTS

<li>(Subject to Realestate.com.au Pty Ltd v Hardingham [2022] HCA 39.)</li>
<li>January 1970: Ms Brasier executed a will appointing Mr Hawkins as executor and residual beneficiary.</li>
<li>Ms Brasier‚Äôs solicitor was Clayton Utz.
<ul>
<li>January 1975: Ms Brasier died.</li>
<li>Clayton Utz didn‚Äôt attempt to find Mr Hawkins until March 1981.</li>
<li>House had degraded and estate was fined for late lodgement of death duty.</li>
<li>Therefore the value of residuary estate was reduced.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mr Hawkins (for the Estate) argued that Clayton Utz had breached an implied term of Ms Brasier‚Äôs retainer contract with the firm imposing a duty to take reasonable care and locate the executor after her death.</li>
<li>Terms inferred based on ‚Äòactual‚Äô intention:
<ul>
<li>Will would be kept safe until Ms Brasier‚Äôs death.</li>
<li>Ms Brasier could request it be delivered to her at any time before her death.</li>

<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThere must be evidence that the custom relied on is so well known and acquiesced in that everyone making a contract in that situation can reasonably be presumed to have imported that term into the contract.‚Äô (236, The Court)</li>
<li>Con-Stan entered an insurance contract with Norwich.

<li>Con-Stan paid premiums to a third-party broker operating on behalf of Norwich, which were never passed onto Norwich.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Norwich sued Con-Stan for the unreceived premiums.

</ul>
</li>
<li>Topic 4.3 Terms implied by law (Not assessed)
<ul>
<li>The final basis for implication of terms is when the law itself implies terms into certain classes of contract. The law can imply terms in two ways
<ul>
<li>First, the common law can imply terms, provided that the implied terms are not inconsistent with the express terms.</li>
<li>Second - and perhaps more commonly these days - legislation can imply terms into contract. Terms implied by legislation often cannot be contracted out of.</li>
<li>doThird, and perhaps most commonly, they can be implied based upon the presumed intention of the parties as evidenced in the express terms.</li>

<li>Secondary terms can continue to bind the parties. Eg, confidentiality clauses, dispute resolution clauses, etc.</li>
<li>To assess whether a contract is performed, it must be construed to determine:
<ul>
<li>What parties are obliged to do.</li>
<li>When those obligations must be performed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tendered performance is then measured against that proper construction.</li>

<li>Most contracts are discharged by performance.</li>
<li>Construe the contract to work out what the parties must do and when.</li>
<li>Most contracts consist of dependant obligations.</li>

<li>INTRODUCTION TO TERMINATION BY AGREEMENT
<ul>
<li>Printing and Numerical Registering Co v Sampson (1875) LR 19 Eq 462</li>
<li>INTRODUCTION
<ul>
<li>Termination by agreement rests on mutual consent.</li>
<li>Termination for breach/repudiation: unilateral act of one party in response to failure to perform by the other.</li>
<li>Frustration: automatic termination by the law in response to a frustrating event.</li>
<li>Termination by agreement can be achieved by:
<ul>
<li>Power granted by a term in the contract.</li>
<li>Expressly or impliedly agreeing to end a contract by entering into another contract.</li>
<li>A contract may also be varied by entering a further agreement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>TERMINATION BY CONTRACTUAL TERM
<ul>
<li>EXPRESS POWER
<ul>
<li>Parties can agree to terms conferring a power to terminate.
<ul>
<li>At will: Contract is immediately terminable at any time.</li>
<li>With notice: A party provides notice and the contract expires after the agreed notice period. (Eg, employment contracts)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CONTINGENT CONDITIONS
<ul>
<li>Terms that either automatically terminate ‚Äî or give the parties the right to terminate ‚Äî if an identified event does / does not occur.</li>
<li>New Zealand Shipping Co Ltd v Soci√©t√© des Ateliers et Chantiers de France [1919] AC 1
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòIt is undoubtedly competent for the two parties to a contract to stipulate by a clause in it that the contract shall be void upon the happening of an event over which neither of the parties shall have any control, cannot bring about, prevent or retard.</li>
<li>For instance, they may stipulate that if rain should fall on the thirtieth day after the date of the contract, the contract should be void.</li>
<li>Then if rain did fall on that day the contract would be put to an end by this event, whether the parties so desire or not.‚Äô (9, Lord Atkinson)</li>

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<ul>
<li>BREACH
<ul>
<li>Breach = Failure to properly perform when required.</li>
<li>‚ÄòActual‚Äô breach requires:</li>
<li>Identification of relevant express or implied term(s) imposing obligation(s).</li>
<li>Construction of relevant term(s) to determine what is required.</li>
<li>Failure to properly perform when required.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>TOTAL / PARTIAL BREACH
<ul>
<li>Not necessary to classify a breach as ‚Äòtotal‚Äô or ‚Äòpartial‚Äô.</li>
<li>Relevant issue is whether it a term is breached at all.</li>
<li>Consequences of breach may be relevant if the term is classed as ‚Äòintermediate‚Äô.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>ANTICIPATORY BREACH</p>
<ul>
<li>Where a party by words or conduct indicates either:
<ul>
<li>an intention not to perform or</li>
<li>a complete incapacity to perform</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>a promise before that performance falls due.</li>
<li>Foran v Wight (1989) 168 CLR 385
<ul>
<li>‚Äô‚Ä¶ an announcement by the promisor before the time for performance arrives that he will not perform the promise is an anticipatory breach ‚Ä¶ .‚Äô 416 (Brennan J)</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>
<p>TRIPARTITE CLASSIFICATION OF TERMS</p>
<ul>
<li>Conditions definition
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòEssential‚Äô terms</li>
<li>Any breach allows termination</li>
<li>Damages available</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Intermediate definition
<ul>
<li>Serious breach allows termination</li>
<li>No termination for trivial breach</li>
<li>Damages available</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Warranty definition
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòInessential‚Äô terms</li>
<li>No termination for breach</li>
<li>Damages available</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A terminable breach does not automatically terminate the contract.</li>
<li>Innocent party may choose to:</li>
<li>Terminate; or</li>
<li>Affirm the contract.</li>
<li>Process of choosing = ‚Äòelection‚Äô.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Principal points to note</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether an innocent party has a right to terminate depends upon the classification of the term.</li>
<li>If they have the right, then they may choose to terminate or affirm (See: Election)</li>
<li>Other remedies (like damages) may be cumulative with the right to terminate</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>MODIFYING THE COMMON LAW RIGHT TO TERMINATE</p>
<ul>
<li>Parties may agree to modify the common law rights to terminate for breach.
<ul>
<li>For example:</li>
<li>Allow termination for any breach of any type of term.</li>
<li>Impose a procedure on how to terminate.</li>

<ul>
<li>TEST OF ESSENTIALITY
<ul>
<li>‚ÄùThe test of essentiality is whether it appears from the general nature of the contract considered as a whole, or from some particular term or terms, that the promise is of such importance to the promisee that he would not have entered into the contract unless he had been assured of a strict ‚Ä¶ performance of the promise ‚Ä¶ and that this ought to have been apparent to the promisor.‚Äô 641-2</li>

<li>Condition definition:
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòIn some cases it is expressly provided that a particular promise is essential to the contract, for example, by a stipulation that it is the basis or of the essence of the contract (Bettini v Gye (1876) 1 QBD 183 at 187) ‚Ä¶ ‚Äô 642 (Jordan CJ)</li>

<li>Luna Park (NSW) Ltd v Tramways Advertising Pty Ltd (1938) 61 CLR 286
<ul>
<li>Tramways promised to display boards on trams advertising Luna Park.</li>
<li>‚ÄòWe guarantee that these boards will be on the tracks at least eight hours per day throughout your season.‚Äô</li>
<li>Tramways displayed the boards for an average of 8 hours a day over the season.</li>
<li>NSW District Court: Tramways breached the term by not displaying all boards for a minimum of 8 hours a day, every day.</li>
<li>High Court: Was the term a condition?</li>
<li>The term was a condition:</li>
<li>Strong language: ‚Äòwe guarantee ‚Ä¶‚Äô</li>
<li>Luna Park obligated to pay only after Tramways had provided the service.</li>
<li>Surrounding circumstances: Luna Park had emphasised the continuous exposure during negotiations.</li>
<li>Associated Newspapers Ltd v Bancks (1951) 83 CLR 322
<ul>
<li>Associated Newspapers employed Bancks to produce weekly comics for 10 years.</li>
<li>Associated promised to publish Bancks‚Äô comics on the first page of the comics section of the ‚ÄòSunday Sun and Guardian‚Äô.</li>
<li>For 3 weeks In 1951, Associated published Bancks‚Äô comic on the third page of the comics section.</li>
<li>Bancks terminated the contract for Associated‚Äôs breach.</li>
<li>Was the term a condition?</li>
<li>The term was a condition:
<ul>
<li>The parties‚Äô mutual promises were ‚Äòconcurrent and corelative‚Äô. ie. the principal reasons why both parties entered the contract.</li>
<li>Continuous, prominent exposure was important to Bancks ‚Äì he would not have entered the contract unless Associated strictly performed its promise</li>

</li>
<li>Tramways Advertising Pty Ltd v Luna Park (NSW) Ltd (1938) 38 SR (NSW) 632
<ul>
<li>The question whether a term in a contract is a condition or a warranty, that is, an essential or a non- essential promise, depends upon the intention of the parties as appearing in or from the contract.‚Äô 642 (Jordan CJ)</li>
<li>Parties may expressly designate a term as a warranty.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No recognised test for a warranty.

<li>GOOD SUMMARY

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ANTICIPATORY BREACH
<ul>
<li>Where a party by words or conduct indicates either:
<ul>
<li>an intention not to perform or</li>
<li>a complete incapacity to perform</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A promise before that performance falls due.</li>
<li>Foran v Wight (1989) 168 CLR 385
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòWhen a promise is an essential term of a contract, an announcement by the promisor before the time for performance arrives that he will not perform the promise is an anticipatory breach amounting to a repudiation of the contract conferring on the promisee a right to [terminate] the contract.‚Äô (416, Brennan J)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Allows a party to terminate immediately on notice that an essential promise will not be performed ‚Äì Innocent party does not have to wait until breach has occurred.</li>
<li>Or innocent party can choose to wait and see.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>TWO FORMS
<ul>
<li>Express anticipatory breach</li>
<li>Implied anticipatory breach</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>EXPRESS ANTICIPATORY BREACH
<ul>
<li>Foran v Wight (1989) 168 CLR 385
<ul>
<li>The Wights agreed to sell land to the Forans.</li>
<li>Date of settlement was an essential term.</li>
<li>Wights telephoned 2 days before settlement to advise that they would not be able to settle.</li>
<li>Neither party attempted settlement.</li>
<li>Forans terminated the contract 2 days after settlement date.</li>
<li>The breach was then anticipatory because it amounted to a refusal by the vendors to perform an essential term of the contract before the time for performance had arrived.‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>IMPLIED ANTICIPATORY BREACH
<ul>
<li>Where the defaulting party‚Äôs conduct or other circumstances make it clear to the innocent party that the defaulting party will not perform an essential obligation when it is due.</li>
<li>Also known as factual inability or factual impossibility.</li>
<li>Universal Cargo Carriers Corp v Citati [1957] 2 QB 401
<ul>
<li>Universal agree to transport Citati‚Äôs cargo from Basrah to Buenos Aires.</li>
<li>Citati did not have cargo available for loading 3 days before Universal‚Äôs ship was due to depart.</li>
<li>Universal departed ‚Äì argued that Citati had impliedly committed an anticipatory breach because cargo was not available with enough time to load.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An anticipatory breach must be proved in fact and not in supposition.‚Äô
<ul>
<li>if Mr. Roskill can produce out of the award a finding, that on July 18 the charterer was unable to load a cargo within such a time as would not have frustrated the object of the venture, the owners would be entitled to succeed.‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>IMPLIED ANTICIPATORY BREACH
<ul>
<li>Terminating because of an implied anticipatory breach is risky because the innocent party must prove the factual impossibility.
<ul>
<li>If the anticipatory breach is express, the innocent party may act on the express statement without more.</li>

</li>
<li>SUMMARY
<ul>
<li>Shevill v Builders Licensing Board (1982) 146 CLR 620
<ul>
<li>‚Äò[A valid contract] may be repudiated if one party renounces his liabilities under it ‚Äì if he evinces an intention no longer to be bound by the contract ‚Ä¶ or shows that he intends to fullfil the contract only in a manner substantially inconsistent with his obligations and not in any other way ‚Ä¶ . In such a case the innocent party is entitled to accept the repudiation, thereby discharging himself from further performance, and sue for damages.‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Repudiation def
<ul>
<li>Repudiation of a contract occurs when one party to the contract demonstrates that it is unwilling or unable to fulfill its obligations under that contract.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Repudiation test
<ul>
<li>The test is whether the party‚Äôs conduct would convey to a reasonable person, in the position of the other contracting party, renunciation of the contract as a whole (ie. an unwillingness or inability to perform all of that party‚Äôs obligations) or of a fundamental obligation under it.
<ul>
<li>A sufficiently serious failure to perform obligations that are not fundamental may also show an unwillingness or an inability to substantially perform the contract according to its requirements (Koompahtoo).</li>

<ul>
<li>‚ÄòFrustration of a contract takes place when there supervenes an event (without default of either party) and for which the contract makes no sufficient provision) which so significantly changes the nature (not merely the expense or onerousness) of the outstanding contractual rights and/or obligations from what the parties could reasonably have contemplated</li>

<li>Residents obtained injunctions limiting Codelfa‚Äôs daily work hours.</li>
<li>Codelfa argued that the injunctions frustrated the contract.</li>

<li>‚ÄòThe answer must, I think, be in the affirmative. ‚Ä¶</li>

<ul>
<li>So far as foreseen events are concerned, the parties to a contract may have foreseen an event but not foreseen the nature or extent of it. ‚Ä¶</li>

</li>
<li>[74] In the case of foreseeable but unforeseen events, the nature and extent of foreseeability is critical.

<li>The purchaser agreed to buy the hotel.</li>
<li>The tenant went bankrupt before settlement.</li>
<li>The purchaser submitted that ‚Äòmost desirable tenant‚Äô was a misrepresentation.</li>
<li>The owner submitted that the statement was an opinion
<ul>
<li>But if the facts are not equally well known to both sides, then a statement of opinion by one who knows the facts best involves very often a statement of a material fact, for he impliedly states that he knows facts which justify his opinion.‚Äô</li>

</li>
<li>Changed circumstances
<ul>
<li>A representation that is true at the time it is made, but which becomes untrue by the time the contract is formed, is a misrepresentation.</li>

<li>If the defendant becomes aware that the representation has become untrue before the contract is formed they must inform the plaintiff.</li>

<li>s 4 of the Australian Consumer Law
<ul>

<li>Australian Consumer Law Section 2 ‚Äì Definitions
<ul>
<li>trade or commerce means:
<ul>
<li>(a) trade or commerce within Australia; or</li>
<li>(b) trade or commerce between Australia and places outside Australia;</li>
<li>and includes any business or professional activity (whether or not carried on for profit).</li>

<li>‚ÄòIN TRADE OR COMMERCE‚Äô
<ul>
<li>Concrete Constructions (NSW) Pty Ltd v Nelson (1990) 169 CLR 594
<ul>
<li>the conduct of a corporation towards persons‚Ä¶ with whomit it‚Ä¶ has or may have dealings in the course of those activities or transactions which, of their nature, bear a trading or commercial character.‚Äô</li>
<li>As a matter of language, a prohibition against engaging
<ul>
<li>in conduct ‚Äúin trade or commerce‚Äù can be construed as encompassing conduct in the course of the myriad of activities which are not, of their nature, of a trading or commercial character but which are undertaken in the course of, or as incidental to, the carrying on of an overall trading or commercial business.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>‚Äô ‚Ä¶it is plain that [s 18] was not intended to extend to all conduct, regardless of its nature, in which a corporation might engage inthe course of, or for the purposes of, its overall trading or commercial business.
<ul>
<li>activities or transactions which, of their nature, bear a trading or commercial character.</li>
<li>An internal communication by one employee to another employee in the course of their ordinary activities in and about the construction of a building.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Such conduct includes, of course, promotional activities in relation to, or for the purposes of, the supply of goods or services to actual or potential consumers, be they identified persons or merely an unidentifiable section of the public.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hearn v O‚ÄôRourke (2003) 129 FCR 63
<ul>
<li>[28] The following propositions emerge from the above extract [from Nelson]:
<ul>
<li>The phrase ‚Äúin trade or commerce‚Äù has a restrictive operation, in the sense that it narrows the operation of [s 18].</li>
<li>The phrase is capable of both a wider and a narrower interpretation.</li>
<li>The wider interpretation would include ‚Äù‚Ä¶ the myriad of activities which are not, of their nature, of a trading or commercial character but which are undertaken in the course of, or as incidental to, the carrying on of an overall trading or commercial business.‚Äù</li>
<li>Such an approach would impose an overlay of Commonwealth law upon any area in which a corporation might act in carrying on its trading or commercial activities. ‚Ä¶</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The second, and narrower construction is that [s 18] applies only to conduct ‚Äù‚Ä¶ which is itself an aspect or element of activities or transactions which, of their nature, bear a trading or commercial character.‚Äù
<ul>
<li>The narrower construction is correct.</li>
<li>The section is concerned with the conduct of a corporation towards persons with whom it has, or may have dealings in the course of its trading activities or transactions which dealings, of their nature, bear a trading or commercial character.</li>
<li>The dividing line between conduct which is in trade or commerce and conduct which is not may be unclear, in which case it may be necessary to identify the features which import a trading or commercial character to an activity which would not, without more, have that character.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The mere driving of a truck or construction of a building is not, without more, in trade or commerce.</li>
<li>To engage in conduct which is divorced from any relevant actual or potential trading or commercial relationship or dealing will not, of itself, constitute conduct ‚Äúin trade or commerce‚Äù for the purposes of the section. (Dowsett J)
<ul>
<li>The focus must be upon the conduct in question and not upon the range of activities in which a relevant corporation may be engaged.</li>
<li>In other words, one does not simply identify the conduct in question, note that the relevant corporation is engaged in commercial activity of some kind, then look for a connection between the two.
<ul>
<li>Because corporations are usually formed to engage in commercial activities, it will rarely be difficult to find such a connection.</li>
<li>The correct approach is to determine whether or not the relevant conduct can, according to ordinary usage, be described as having occurred in the course of dealings ‚Äú‚Ä¶which, of their nature, bear a trading or commercial character‚Äù.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ultimately a question of fact.</li>
<li>Note: only the defendant needs to be acting in trade or commerce: not the plaintiff.</li>
<li>Lubidineuse v Bevanere Pty Ltd (1984) 3 FCR 1
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòIn determining whether, in a particular case, that test is met it is relevant to consider inter alia the character of the parties involved ‚Äì which I assume to include whether they are people who have engaged, or are about to engage, in commercial activities ‚Äì whether the transaction is motivated by business, as distinct from personal, reasons and whether the person whose conduct is under attack played an active part in the transaction.‚Äô (12, Wilcox J)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bevanere Pty Ltd v Lubidineuse (1985) 7 FCR 325
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe sale of the clinic should not be viewed in isolation from the totality of the appellant‚Äôs commercial activities</li>
<li>The mere fact that it was the sale of a capital asset did not deprive it of its character as a transaction in trade or commerce.‚Äô</li>
<li>But that is not to say that a corporation must engage in multiple transactions of a similar kind for it to be engaged in trade or commerce</li>
<li>In our opinion, the making of the arrangements necessary to dispose of the clinic were part and parcel of the totality of the appellant‚Äôs activities in trade or commerce.‚Äô</li>
<li>But if the transaction is motivated by business, then it may be trade or commerc</li>

</li>
<li>Houghton v Arms (2006) 225 CLR 553
<ul>
<li>while in most cases, the focus would be on the nature of the business of the party making the representation, [s 18] was not so limited;
<ul>
<li>in particular, the section did not, in terms, refer to the trade or commerce of any particular corporation</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tobacco Institute of Australia Ltd v Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations Inc (1992) 38 FCR 1
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThere can be no doubt that a corporation, formed to promote the interests of a particular industry or whose activities are directed at representing members of that industry in promotional activities, acts ‚Äúin trade or commerce‚Äù when conveying representations about that industry‚Äôs product to the general public.‚Äô</li>
</ul>

<li>O‚ÄôBrien v Smolonogov (1983) 53 ALR 107
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòBut, in our view, there mere use, by a person not acting in the course of carrying on a business, of facilities commonly employed in commercial transactions, cannot transform a dealing which lacks any business character into something done in trade or commerce.‚Äô (114, The Court)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the defendant was not acting ‚Äòin trade or commerce‚Äô, then the plaintiff will need to prove common law misrepresentation.</li>

</li>
<li>Shahid v Australasian College of Dermatologists (2008) 168 FCR 46
<ul>
<li>[182] ‚Ä¶ first, that the expression ‚Äútrade or commerce‚Äù should be so read as to include any professional activity; secondly, that a professional activity will only be such as is unequivocally and distinctively characteristic of the carrying on of a profession; but thirdly, that whether the activity should also be such that, when done in the carrying on of a profession, it bears a trading or commercial character is an open question.</li>

<li>Kowalczuk v Accom Finance [2008] NSWCA 343 [351]
<ul>
<li>I conclude that the fact that Dalla was engaged in professional activities as a solicitor is not in itself sufficient reason why section [18] cannot apply to him.</li>
<li>The provision by Dalla of legal advice to Kowalczuk was carried out ‚Äúin trade or commerce‚Äù, within the meaning of section [18].</li>

<ul>
<li>Misleading def, deceptive def, misleading or deceptive defintion, misleading and deceptive def</li>
<li>[111] Condut is misleading or deceptive if it induces or is capable of inducing error.
<ul>
<li>In determining whether a contravention of [s 18] has occurred, the task of the court is to examine the relevant course of conduct as a whole.
<ul>
<li>It is determined by reference to the alleged conduct in the light of the relevant surrounding facts and circumstances.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is an objective question that the court must determine for itself.
<ul>
<li>It invites error to look at isolated parts of the corporation‚Äôs conduct.</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Taco Company of Australia Inc v Taco Bell Pty Ltd (1982) 42 ALR 177
<ul>
<li>Ordinarily, however, a tendency to cause confusion or uncertainty will not suffice to establish that conduct is of the type described in [s 18].</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Campbell v Backoffice Investments Pty Ltd (2009) 238 CLR 304
<ul>
<li>it involves consideration of a notional cause and effect relationship between the conduct and the state of mind of the relevant person or class of persons.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MISLEADING OR DECEPTIVE‚Äô
<ul>
<li>In dealings between identified individuals, the court will look at all the circumstances of the case:</li>
<li>The nature of the parties (Sophisticated business people dealing at arm‚Äôs length?</li>
<li>A consumer dealing with a corporation? Age, education, experience, etc)</li>
<li>The nature of the transaction (Sale of valuable property? Provision of a highly technical service? Purchase of a toilet brush?)</li>
<li>What was said/communicated in writing and how it was communicated.</li>
<li>What the parties knew about each other / how they presented themselves.</li>
<li>Industry context: prevailing norms or practices within the industry.</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Choo v Zhang [2016] NSWCA 193 (5 August 2016)
<ul>
<li>But in a case where the impugned conduct is said to consist of representations, the question of whether the conduct was misleading or deceptive ordinarily must be determined by what a reasonable person in the position of the representee would have made of the representations, taking into account all relevant circumstances</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>OPINIONS / STATEMENT OF FUTURE MATTER
<ul>
<li>Common law reasoning can apply.</li>
<li>ie, it can be misleading or deceptive if a defendant gives an opinion or makes a statement of future action when:</li>
<li>They do not honestly believe the statement; or</li>
<li>Do not have reasonable grounds for making the statement</li>
<li>Campbell v Backoffice Investments Pty Ltd (2009) 238 CLR 304
<ul>
<li>Opinions may carry with them one or more implied representations according to the circumstances of the case.
<ul>
<li>There will ordinarily be an implied representation that the person offering the opinion actually holds it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other implied representations may be that the opinion is based upon reasonable grounds, which may include the representation that it was formed on the basis of reasonable enquiries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>STATEMENT OF FUTURE MATTER
<ul>
<li>Wheeler Grace and Pierucci Pty Ltd v Wright (1989) ATPR ¬∂40-940
<ul>
<li>Employee induced Wrights into investing in mining operation with a clear, unqualified promise that they would receive a certain return.</li>
<li>Wrights argued that employee impliedly represented that he had reasonable grounds for the promise when he made it, which he did not.</li>
<li>The implied representation was misleading or deceptive conduct.
<ul>
<li>The fact that the corporation believed or had reasonable grounds for belief that the prediction would be fulfilled, would not answer the question as to whether the conduct was misleading or deceptive conduct in trade or commerce.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Honest belief in and reasonable grounds for saying that something will occur may not prevent the statement being misleading or deceptive.
<ul>
<li>For example, if the context requires that the statement be qualified to acknowledge risk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>OPINIONS
<ul>
<li>Forrest v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (2012) 247 CLR 486
<ul>
<li>Forrest told an audience of sophisticated investors that Fortescue Metals Group had a ‚Äòbinding contract‚Äô with a Chinese company.</li>
<li>Fortescue had not signed a legally binding contract.</li>
<li>Anticipating an ‚Äòopinion‚Äô argument, ASIC argued that Forrest impliedly misrepresented that he had a reasonable ground for making the statement.</li>
<li>It is ultimately unprofitable to attempt to classify the statement according to some taxonomy, no matter whether that taxonomy adopts as its relevant classes fact and opinion, fact and law, or some mixture of these classes.
<ul>
<li>It is necessary instead to examine more closely and identify more precisely what it is that the impugned statements conveyed to their audience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The common law approach may be used, but not necessary.
<ul>
<li>Only question: would a reasonable person be misled or deceived by the defendant‚Äôs conduct?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>STATEMENT OF FUTURE MATTER</li>
<li>Australian Consumer Law Section 4 ‚Äì Misleading representations with respect to future matters
<ul>
<li>(1) If:
<ul>
<li>(a) a person makes a representation with respect to any future matter (including the doing of, or the refusing to do, any act); and</li>
<li>(b) the person does not have reasonable grounds for making the representation;
<ul>
<li>the representation is taken, for the purposes of this Schedule, to be misleading.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(2) For the purposes of applying subsection (1) in relation to a proceeding concerning a representation made with respect to a future matter by:
<ul>
<li>(a) a party to the proceeding; or</li>
<li>(b) any other person;
<ul>
<li>the party ‚Ä¶ is taken not to have had reasonable grounds for making the representation, unless evidence is adduced to the contrary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="3">
<li>To avoid doubt, subsection (2) does not:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>(a) have the effect that, merely because such evidence to the contrary is adduced, the person who made the representation is taken to have had reasonable grounds for making the representation; or</li>
<li>(b) have the effect of placing on any person an onus of proving that the person who made the representation had reasonable grounds for making the representation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(4) Subsection (1) does not limit by implication the meaning of a reference in this Schedule to:
<ul>
<li>(a) a misleading representation; or</li>
<li>(b) a representation that is misleading in a material particular; or</li>
<li>(c) conduct that is misleading or is likely or liable to mislead;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>and, in particular, does not imply that a representation that a person makes with respect to any future matter is not misleading merely because the person has reasonable grounds for making the representation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SILENCE
<ul>
<li>At common law, silence is only a misrepresentation when there is a recognised duty to speak.</li>
<li>Under s 18, silence is misleading or deceptive in wider circumstances:</li>
<li>Where there is a common law duty to speak.</li>
<li>When the circumstances give right to a ‚Äòreasonable expectation‚Äô that the defendant would disclose something.</li>
<li>Demagogue Pty Ltd v Ramensky (1992) 39 FCR 31
<ul>
<li>Facts
<ul>
<li>Ramenskys bought terrace house off the plan.</li>
<li>Only vehicular access to land across land owned by third party.</li>
<li>Discussion and documents did not reveal that the driveway subject to approval by the third party.</li>
<li>Ramenskys argued that the failure to disclose the circumstances of the driveway was misleading or deceptive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The question is simply whether, having regard to all the relevant circumstances, there has been conduct that is misleading or deceptive or that is likely to mislead or deceive</li>
<li>That context may or may not include facts giving rise to a reasonable expectation, in the circumstances of the case for if particular matters exist they will be disclosed.</li>

<li>BMW required that the policy be ‚Äòassignable and cancellable‚Äô but did not clearly communicate this to Miller.</li>
<li>The policy was not assignable nor cancellable. Miller provided a copy of it to BMW before the money was loaned, but BMW did not read it.</li>

<li>Butcher v Lachlan Elder Realty Pty Ltd (2004) 218 CLR 592
<ul>
<li>Facts
<ul>
<li>Lachlan Elder included a misleading survey in a brochure promoting a house for sale.</li>
<li>The brochure was short and contained two disclaimers.</li>
<li>The Butchers relied on the survey to make plans for development of the house.</li>
<li>After contracts exchanged, the Butchers discovered that the survey was inaccurate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>causal link between the impugned conduct and the loss that is claimed.</li>
<li>Character of the particular conduct of the particular agent in relation to the particular purchasers, bearing in mind what matters of fact each knew about the other as a result of the nature of their dealings and the conversations between them, or which each may be taken to have known.
<ul>
<li>Hence it would have been plain to a reasonable purchaser that the agent was not the source of the information which was said to be misleading.</li>

</li>
<li>Campbell v Backoffice Investments Pty Ltd (2009) 238 CLR 304

<li>Butcher v Lachlan Elder Realty Pty Ltd (2004) 218 CLR 592

<li>If a disclaimer clause has the effect of erasing whatever is misleading in the conduct, the clause will be effective, not by any independent force of its own, but by actually modifying the conduct.</li>

<li>Of course, if the clause actually has the effect or erasing whatever is misleading in the conduct, the clause will be effective, not by any independent force of its own, but by actually modifying the conduct.
<ul>
<li>the suggestion of the suitability of the building for strata title conversion might continue to influence the mind of a prospective purchaser notwithstanding his awareness of the existence of a disclaimer clause, which did not single out the particular representation, but purported to apply generally to every detail stated in the investment report.</li>

</li>
<li>If a disclaimer clause has the effect of erasing whatever is misleading in the conduct, the clause will be effective, not by any independent force of its own, but by actually modifying the conduct.

<li>The Australian Consumer Law Section 237 ‚Äì Compensation orders etc. on application by an injured person or the regulator
<ul>
<li>(1) A court may:
<ul>
<li>(a) on application of a person (the injured person) who has suffered, or is likely to suffer, loss or damage because of the conduct of another person that:
<ul>
<li>(i) was engaged in a contravention of a provision of Chapter 2, 3 or 4; or ‚Ä¶ make such order or orders as the court thinks appropriate against the person who engaged in the conduct, or a person involved in that conduct.</li>

</li>
<li>The Australian Consumer Law Section 236 ‚Äì Actions for damages
<ul>
<li>(1) If:
<ul>
<li>(a) a person (the claimant) suffers loss or damage because of the conduct of another person; and</li>
<li>(b) the conduct contravened a provision of Chapter 2 or 3; the claimant may recover the amount of the loss or damage by action against that other person, or against any person involved in the contravention.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(2) An action under subsection (1) may be commenced at any time within 6 years after the day on which the cause of action that relates to the conduct accrued.</li>

<li>Henjo Investments Pty Ltd v Collins Marrickville Pty Ltd (1988) 39 FCR 546

<li>Gould v Vaggelas (1985) 157 CLR 215
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Notwithstanding that a representation is both false and fraudulent, if the plaintiff does not rely upon it, he or she has no case.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>If a material representation is made which is calculated to induce the plaintiff to enter into a contract and that person in fact enters into a contract there arises a fair inference of fact that he or she was induced to do so by the representation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="3">
<li>The inference may be rebutted, for example, by showing that the plaintiff, before he or she entered into the contract, either was possessed of actual knowledge or the true facts and knew them to be true or alternatively made it plain that whether, he or she knew the true facts or not, he or she did not rely on the representation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="4">
<li>The representation need not be the sole inducement. It is sufficient so long as it plays some part, even if only a minor part, in contributing to the formation of the contract. (Wilson J)</li>

<li>A declaration by the plaintiff that they did not rely on any representations or conduct of the defendant.</li>
<li>Campbell v Backoffice Investments Pty Ltd (2009) 238 CLR 304
<ul>
<li>A subsequent declaration of non-reliance by a person said to have been affected by the conduct is more likely to be relevant to the question of causation</li>
<li>For if a person expressly declares in a contractual document that he or she did not rely upon pre-contractual representations, that declaration may, according to the circumstances, be evidence of non-reliance and of the want of a causal link between the impugned conduct and the loss or damage flowing from entry into the contract.</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>MISTAKE</p>
<ul>
<li>Mistake can manifest in two ways in contract:
<ul>
<li>It can vitiate consent (be a reason to avoid a contract).</li>
<li>Be a typographical error in a written agreement.</li>
<li>Remedy is rectification: studied in 71116 Remedies</li>
<li>In this subject, we look at mistake as a reason to avoid a contract.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MISTAKE AS A VITIATING FACTOR
<ul>
<li>Mistake is very rarely pleaded and rarely found to void a contract:
<ul>
<li>The mistake must be fundamental: it must make the contract unworkable, or it must be unconscionable to enforce it in light of the mistake: Couturier v Hastie (1856) 10 ER 1065</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bell v Lever Bros [1932] AC 161
<ul>
<li>So the agreement of A and B to purchase a specific article is void if in fact the article had perished before the date of sale.
<ul>
<li>In this case, though the parties in fact were agreed about the subject-matter, yet a consent to transfer or take delivery of something not existent is deemed useless, the consent is nullified.‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Often the contract will allocate the risks of any mistake, which can be resolved by construction or implication of terms.
<ul>
<li>The mistake must not be due to the fault of the defendant.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>McRae v Commonwealth Disposals Commission (1951) 84 CLR 377
<ul>
<li>the Commission cannot in this case rely on any mistake as avoiding the contract, because any mistake was induced by the serious fault of their own servants, who asserted the existence of a tanker recklessly and without any reasonable ground.
<ul>
<li>The Commission contracted that a tanker existed in the position specified.
<ul>
<li>Since there was no such tanker, there has been a breach of contract, and the plaintiffs are entitled to damages for that breach</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Often the mistake can be resolved by operation of other vitiating factors which are easier to prove.
<ul>
<li>Esp, misrepresentation or misleading or deceptive conduct.</li>
<li>Mistake concerns the subjective intentions of the parties, but contract law is premised on how parties objectively manifest their intentions.</li>
<li>Certainty of contract would be unacceptably disrupted if parties could avoid contracts because of mistakes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Smith v Hughes (1871) LR 6 QB 597
<ul>
<li>The rule of law is that stated in Freeman v Cooke.
<ul>
<li>If, whatever a man‚Äôs real intention may be, he so conducts himself that a reasonable man would believe that he was assenting to the terms proposed by the other party, and that other party upon that belief enters into the contract with him, the man thus conducting himself would be equally bound as if he had intended to agree to the other party‚Äôs terms.‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Three types of mistake:
<ul>
<li>Common mistake: both parties make the same mistake.</li>
<li>Mutual mistake: The parties are at ‚Äòcross purposes‚Äô because both parties have made their own mistake.</li>
<li>Unilateral mistake: The parties are at ‚Äòcross purposes‚Äô but only one party is mistaken.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>‚Äúthis is not my deed‚Äù</li>
<li>Allows a plaintiff to avoid a signed legal instrument which is radically different to what the plaintiff thought they had signed.</li>
<li>Petelin v Cullen (1975) 132 CLR 355
<ul>
<li>first, the injustice of holding a person to a bargain to which he has not brought a consenting mind; and,</li>
<li>secondly, the necessity of holding a person who signs a document to that document, more particularly so as to protect innocent persons who rely on that signature when there is no reason to doubt its validity which must necessarily be kept within narrow limits‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Toll (FGCT) Pty Ltd v Alphapharm Pty Ltd (2004) 219 CLR 165
<ul>
<li>Legal instruments of various kinds take their efficacy from signature or execution.</li>
<li>Such instruments are often signed by people who have not read and understood all their terms, but who are nevertheless committed to those terms by the act of signature or execution.
<ul>
<li>It is that commitment which enables third parties to assume the legal efficacy of the instrument.</li>
<li>To undermine that assumption would cause serious mischief.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ELEMENTS of Non Est Factum
<ul>
<li>Legal instrument (contract, deed, etc) signed by a party;</li>
<li>Signer unable to read/understand the instrument</li>
<li>Signer:
<ul>
<li>Subjectively mistaken about the legal effect of the instrument; or</li>
<li>Unable to comprehend the legal effect of the instrument.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When claiming against innocent 3Ps: the signer was not careless.</li>
<li>Did the signer‚Äôs mind ‚Äúgo with the pen‚Äù?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>INABILITY TO READ / UNDERSTAND
<ul>
<li>Reasons for inability to read/understand:
<ul>
<li>Blindness: Saunders v Anglia Building Society [1971] AC 122.</li>
<li>Illiteracy: Petelin v Cullen (1975) 132 CLR 355.</li>
<li>Incapacity: Ford v Perpetual Trustees Victoria Limited (2009) 75 NSWLR 42.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Inability can be temporary: Saunders v Anglia Building Society [1971] AC 122.</li>
<li>Must not be due to the fault of the signer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>INABILITY TO READ / UNDERSTAND
<ul>
<li>Petelin v Cullen (1975) 132 CLR 355
<ul>
<li>Petelin (illiterate) granted option to Cullen to purchase land owned by Petelin.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cullen‚Äôs agent presented a ‚Äòreceipt‚Äô for signing, which was an extension of the option.</li>
<li>Petelin signed believing it was just a receipt for paying $50.</li>
<li>Cullen attempted to enforce the option.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>INSTRUMENT RADICALLY DIFFERENT
<ul>
<li>Saunders v Anglia Building Society [1971] AC 1004
<ul>
<li>Mrs Gallie believed that she transferred her house to her nephew (Parkin) so that he and his business partner (Lee) could use it as security in their business venture.</li>
<li>She could not read the transfer because her glasses were broken.</li>
<li>In fact, the document transferred the house to Lee.</li>
<li>They used the house as security for a loan from Anglia and defaulted.</li>
<li>Anglia moved to sell the house.</li>
<li>Mrs Gallie argued that the transfer to Lee was void due to non est factum, thus she retained ownership of it.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>‚ÄòBut what upon the plaintiff‚Äôs own evidence was the essential character of the document she was intending to execute?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CARELESSNESS
<ul>
<li>Petelin v Cullen (1975) 132 CLR 355
<ul>
<li>The insistence that such precautions should be taken as a condition of making out the defence is of fundamental importance when the defence is asserted against an innocent person</li>
<li>It is otherwise when the defence is asserted against the other party to the transaction who is aware of the circumstances in which it came to be executed and who knows (because the document was signed on his representation) or has reason to suspect that it was executed under some misapprehension as to its character.
<ul>
<li>element of carelessness has no relevance for the present case.</li>
<li>The appellant‚Äôs belief that the document was a receipt was inspired by the agent‚Äôs representation</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>‚ÄòReasonable precautions‚Äô will depend upon the facts of the case.
<ul>
<li>For example:
<ul>
<li>Take reasonable steps to verify the contents of an instrument before signing.</li>
<li>Having a trusted person read/translate the instrument.</li>
<li>Wearing glasses or other aid if reasonably available.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ford v Perpetual Trustees Victoria Limited (2009) 75 NSWLR 42</p>
<ul>
<li>Mr Ford: intellectually handicapped and practically illiterate.</li>
<li>Mr Ford‚Äôs son, Scott, manipulated Mr Ford into obtaining a loan from Perpetual and providing his house as security.</li>
<li>Loan arranged through third party broker, so Perpetual was unaware of Ford‚Äôs incapacity.</li>
<li>Ford argued his signature was voided by non est factum.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The totality of the findings are clear that Mr Ford did not know what he was signing, in that he did not understand anything at all about the documents he was signing such that it can be concluded that his mind did not go with his pen.</p>
<ul>
<li>Here, given the manipulation of Mr Ford by his son, it cannot be concluded that he failed to take any precautions that a person in his position and with his attributes should have.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

</li>
<li>UNILATERAL MISTAKE IN EQUITY
<ul>
<li>Equity can also void a written contract entered under a mistake about a fundamental term.
<ul>
<li>More than mistake is required: it must be unconscionable to hold the mistaken party to the signed document.</li>
<li>Typically, that requires the non-mistaken party to take steps to ensure the mistaken party does not discover their mistake.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Goldsbrough Mort &amp; Co Ltd v Quinn (1910) 10 CLR 674
<ul>
<li>Quinn granted an option to sell his land for ‚Äò¬£1 10s per acre calculated on a freehold basis.‚Äô</li>
<li>Quinn was mistaken about how much he would receive.</li>
<li>Argued that the contract was unenforceable due to his mistake.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Taylor v Johnson (1983) 151 CLR 422
<ul>
<li>Lead case in unilateral mistakes</li>
<li>Mrs Johnson granted an option to sell 10 acres of land to the Taylors, which they exercised.</li>
<li>Mrs Johnson believed that the price was $15,000 per acre.
<ul>
<li>The price recorded in both the option and later contract was $15,000 for the entire 10 acres.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Evidence suggested that the Taylors knew Mrs Johnson was mistaken and they actively prevented her from discovering the truth.</li>
<li>It is that a party who has entered into a written contract under a serious mistake about its contents in relation to a fundamental term will be entitled in equity to an order rescinding the contract if the other party is aware
<ul>
<li>deliberately sets out to ensure that the first party does not become aware of the existence of his mistake or misapprehension</li>

</li>
<li>The classic case of duress encompasses:

<li>Threatened assaults;</li>
<li>False imprisonment.</li>

</li>

</li>

<li>Common issue:

<li>where is the boundary between ‚Äòillegitimate pressure‚Äô and ‚Äòhard bargaining‚Äô?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Barton v Armstrong [1976] AC 104
<ul>
<li>‚Äò[An alleged case of duress] involves consideration of what the law regards as voluntary, or its opposite; for in life, including the life of commerce and finance, many acts are done under pressure, sometimes overwhelming pressure, so that one can say that the actor had no choice but to act.</li>
<li>Absence of choice in this sense does not negate consent in law: for this the pressure must be one of a kind which the law does not regard as legitimate. Thus, out of the various means by which consent may be obtained ‚Äì advice, persuasion, influence, inducement, representation, commercial pressure - the law has come to select some which it will not accept as a reason for voluntary action: fraud, abuse of relation of confidence, undue influence, duress or coercion.‚Äô (Lord Wilberforce and Lord Simon of Glaisdale (Dissent))</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The mere fact that pressure is applied ‚Äì even overwhelming pressure ‚Äì or that parties bargain from unequal bargaining positions is not sufficient to amount to duress.</li>
<li>Crescendo Management v Westpac (1988) 19 NSWLR 40
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe proper approach in my opinion is to: ask whether any applied pressure induced the victim to enter into the contract and then ask whether that pressure went beyond what the law is prepared to countenance as legitimate?
<ul>
<li>Pressure will be illegitimate if it consists of unlawful threats ‚Ä¶ But the categories are not closed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Even overwhelming pressure, not amounting to unconscionable or unlawful conduct, however, will not necessarily constitute economic duress.‚Äô (McHugh JA)</li>

<li>To the contrary, there appears to be much to be said for the view that, rather than persist with a blanket restriction of illegitimate pressure to pressure exerted by unlawful means, it would better accord with equitable principle, and better align with English and American authority, if the test of illegitimate pressure were whether the pressure goes beyond what is reasonably necessary for the protection of legitimate interests ..‚Äô (Nettle J, citations omitted)</li>

<li>‚ÄòIt is unnecessary, however, for the victim to prove that the illegitimate pressure was the sole reason for him entering into the contract.</li>
<li>It is sufficient that the illegitimate pressure was one of the reasons for the person entering into the agreement.</li>

<li>Undue influence
<ul>
<li>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<ul>
<li>Common law duress requires the application of illegitimate pressure.</li>
<li>Equity will relieve a plaintiff of a contract obtained by ‚Äòundue‚Äô influence, which may be less than ‚Äòillegitimate‚Äô pressure.</li>
<li>Allcard v Skinner (1887) 36 Ch D 145
<ul>
<li>Or is it that it is right and expedient to save them from being victimised by other people?
<ul>
<li>In my opinion the doctrine of undue influence is founded upon the second of these two principles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On the other hand, to protect people from being forced, tricked or misled in any way by others into parting with their property is one of the most legitimate objects of all laws;
<ul>
<li>and the equitable doctrine of undue influence has grown out of and been developed by the necessity of grappling with insidious forms of spiritual tyranny and with the infinite varieties of fraud.‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>COMPARISON WITH DURESS
<ul>
<li>Duress is sometimes seen as an extreme form of undue influence.</li>
<li>Whereas:
<ul>
<li>a victim of duress will be consciously coerced into a contract,</li>
<li>undue influence can be subtle, well-intended and the victim may not be aware of it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Thorne v Kennedy (2017) 263 CLR 85
<ul>
<li>‚Äúno Court has ever attempted to define undue influence‚Äù‚Ä¶ the boundaries, particularly between undue influence and duress, are blurred.</li>
<li>One reason why there is no clear distinction is that undue influence can arise from widely different sources,</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2 FORMS OF UNDUE INFLUENCE
<ul>
<li>Johnson v Buttress (1936) 56 CLR 113
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe jurisdiction of a court of equity to set aside gifts [and contracts] inter vivos which have been procured by undue influence is exercised where
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>undue influence is proved as a fact, or [‚Äòactual undue influence‚Äô]</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Typically a trick (scared out of cookie)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>

<li>where, undue influence being presumed from the relations existing between the parties, the presumption has not been rebutted.‚Äô [‚Äòpresumed undue influence‚Äô]</li>

<li>Actual Undue Influence
<ul>
<li>Johnson v Buttress (1936) 56 CLR 113
<ul>
<li>‚Äòfacts must be proved showing that the transaction was the outcome of such an actual influence over the mind of the [plaintiff] that it cannot be considered his free act.‚Äô (134, Dixon J)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Credit and Commerce International SA v Aboody [1990] 1 QB 923
<ul>
<li>‚Äô‚Ä¶ we think that a person relying on a plea of actual undue influence must show that:
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>the other party to the transaction (or someone who induced the transaction for his own benefit) had the capacity to influence the complainant;</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>the influence was exercised;</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="3">

</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CAPACITY TO INFLUENCE
<ul>
<li>Influential relationships are very common, thus the capacity to influence is seldom difficult to establish.
<ul>
<li>Influential relationships can take infinite forms.</li>
<li>Often there will be unequal bargaining power.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Typically, the relationships involve close, personal relationships of trust, confidence or reliance:
<ul>
<li>Spouses</li>
<li>Family members</li>
<li>Professionals/clients</li>
<li>Religious teachers/followers</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>INFLUENCE IN FACT EXERCISED
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòInfluence‚Äô can take any form:</li>
<li>Over threats Persistent persuasion.</li>
<li>Taking advantage of someone at an unusual time or place ‚Äì esp if they‚Äôre distracted or vulnerable.</li>
<li>Taking advantage of a position of authority.</li>
<li>Merely being a silent, but forceful, presence in the room.</li>
<li>Having others apply pressure or persuasion.</li>
<li>Key consideration: the quality of the consent of the plaintiff.</li>
<li>Johnson v Buttress (1936) 56 CLR 113

</li>
<li>Micarone v Perpetual Trustees (1999) 75 SASR 1
<ul>
<li>[286] ‚Ä¶ the question is not whether, in the literal sense, there was the exercise of an independent and voluntary will, but whether that exercise took place in an environment in which the actors were able to form a proper judgment ‚Ä¶ .

<li>Credit and Commerce International SA v Aboody [1990] 1 QB 923
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe mere fact that in order to get his own way he chose deliberately to say nothing as to the risks, rather than to misrepresent them, would not, in our judgment, save his conduct from being unconscionable or absolve him from a charge of actual undue influence, bearing in mind that it was he who invited her to enter into them.

<ul>
<li>Allcard v Skinner (1887) 36 Ch D 145
<ul>
<li>The law does not exclude influence. Nay, it recognises influence as natural and right.
<ul>
<li>Few, if any, men are gifted with characters enabling them to act, or even think, with complete independence of others, which could not largely exist without destroying the foundations of society.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But the law requires that, influence, however natural and right, shall not be unduly exercised, that is, shall be exercised only in due proportion to the surrounding circumstances and the strength of the person submitted to it.</li>
<li>The more powerful influence or the weaker patient alike evokes a stronger application of the safeguard ‚Ä¶‚Äô (157-158, Kewich J)</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Johnson v Buttress (1936) 56 CLR 113

<ul>
<li>There is no doubt in my mind that the presumption has not been rebutted. ‚Ä¶ Rather it is my view that the evidence goes further than simply giving rise to the presumption; it establishes a case of actual undue influence.‚Äô (416-417, Duggan J)</li>

</li>
<li>2 CLASSES OF PRESUMED UNDUE INFLUENCE
<ul>
<li>Johnson v Buttress (1936) 56 CLR 113
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòWhere certain special relations exist undue influence is presumed</li>
<li>Wherever the relation between donor and donee is such that the latter is in a position to exercise dominion over the former by reason of the trust and confidence reposed in the latter, the presumption of undue influence is raised</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>FIDUCIARY RELATIONSHIPS
<ul>
<li>If the relationship between the parties is fiduciary, then the law will presume undue influence on proof of that relationship without more.
<ul>
<li>Examples:
<ul>
<li>Solicitor to client</li>
<li>Doctor to patient</li>
<li>Religious adviser to disciple</li>
<li>Parent (or person in loco parentis) to child</li>
<li>Guardian to ward</li>
<li>Trustee to beneficiary</li>
<li>DOES NOT INCLUDE: Siblings; Child/Parent; Husband/Wife;</li>
<li>Employer/employee; Banker/customer</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation (1984) 156 CLR 41
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe critical feature of these relationships is that the fiduciary undertakes or agrees to act for or on behalf of or in the interests of another person in the exercise of a power or discretion which will affect the interests of that other person in a legal or practical sense.
<ul>
<li>The relationship between the parties is therefore one which gives the fiduciary a special opportunity to exercise the power or discretion to the detriment of that other person who is accordingly vulnerable to abuse by the fiduciary of his position.‚Äô (96-97, Mason J)</li>

</li>
<li>Tulloch (deceased) v Braybon (No 2) [2010] NSWSC 650 (17 June 2010)

<ul>
<li>for a relationship to be brought within the doctrine, it must go beyond one of mere confidence and influence, to one involving dominion or ascendancy by one over the will of the other, and correlatively dependence and subjection on the part of the other.</li>

<li>‚ÄòThe circumstances adversely affecting a party, which may induce a court of equity either to refuse its aid or to set a transaction aside, are of great variety and can hardly be satisfactorily classified.

<li>‚ÄòIt does not appear to be essential in all cases that the party at a disadvantage should suffer loss or detriment by the bargain. ‚Ä¶</li>
<li>But inadequacy of consideration, while never of itself a ground for resisting enforcement, will often be a specially important element in cases of this type.

<li>Crown encouraged Kakavas to gamble by providing him benefits such as free accommodation etc.</li>
<li>Kakavas lost $20m in 1 year.</li>
<li>Kakavas wanted to void the transactions by arguing that he was addicted to gambling and Crown exploited that disadvantage.</li>
<li>High Court held that he was not at a special disadvantage and Crown had no knowledge.</li>
<li>Gambling transactions are a rare, if not unique, species of economic activity in a civilised community, in that each party sets out openly to inflict harm on the counterparty.</li>
<li>The plaintiff must be able to point to conduct on the part of the defendant, beyond the ordinary conduct of the business, which makes it just to require the defendant to restore the plaintiff to his or her previous position.</li>

<li>Was it unconscionable for him to retain the gift unconditionally?</li>
<li>it is the attempt to retain the benefit obtained from the special disadvantage of his mother that is the issue.</li>

<li>[23] In his reasons for decision in Yerkey v Jones, Dixon J dealt with at least two kinds of circumstances:

<li>the second ‚Ä¶ in which there is no undue influence but there is a failure to explain suretyship transaction which the husband seeks to have the wife enter for the immediate economic benefit not of the wife but of the husband, or the circumstances in which her liability may arise.</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Yerkey v Jones begins with the recognition that the surety is a volunteer</li>

<ul>
<li>Notice of husband/wife relationship sufficient to ground the claim:
<ul>

<li>Garcia v National Australia Bank (1998) 194 CLR 395

<li>[40] We consider that the only question of notice that arises is whether the creditor knew at the time of the taking of the guarantee that the surety was then married to the borrower.</li>
<li>Other questions of notice do not intrude.</li>
<li>And what makes it unconscionable to enforce it in the second kind of case is the combination of circumstances that
<ul>
<li>a) in fact the surety did not understand the purport and effect of the transaction;</li>
<li>b) the transaction was voluntary (in the sense that the surety obtained no gain from the contract the performance of which was guaranteed);</li>
<li>c) the lender is to be taken to have understood that, as a wife, the surety may repose trust and confidence in her husband in matters of business and therefore to have understood that the husband may not fully and accurately explain the purport and effect of the transaction to his wife; and yet</li>

<ul>
<li>TERMINOLOGY
<ul>
<li>Terminate def/ Termination def
<ul>
<li>Used to describe the legal effect of:</li>
<li>A party‚Äôs decision to end a contract because of breach or repudiation.</li>
<li>A frustrating event.</li>

<li>Highfield Property Investments Pty Ltd v Commercial &amp; Residential Developments (SA) Pty Ltd [2012] SASC 165
<ul>
<li>The word ‚Äúrescission‚Äù is ambiguous. It is sometimes used to encompass not only ‚Äúrescission‚Äù ab initio for misrepresentation but also ‚Äúrescission‚Äù prospectively for breach and sometimes just to refer to ‚Äúrescission‚Äù ab initio for misrepresentation.
<ul>
<li>For clarity, I use that term exclusively to denote a rescission which has the effect of avoiding the contract (and actions taken under it) from the outset (eg for misrepresentation) and I use the term ‚Äútermination‚Äù to denote a termination of future performance only (or dissolution) of the contract (eg for breach).</li>

<li>TERMINATION

<li>Secondary terms intended to survive termination are enforceable.</li>
<li>McDonald v Dennys Lascelles Ltd (1933) 48 CLR 457
<ul>
<li>When a party to a simple contract, upon breach by the other contracting party of a condition of the contract, elects to treat the contract as no longer binding upon him, the contract is not rescinded as from the beginning.
<ul>
<li>Both parties are discharged from the further performance of the contract, but rights are not divested or discharged which have already been unconditionally acquired.</li>
<li>Rights and obligations that arise from the partial execution of the contract and causes of action which have accrued from its breach alike continue unaffected.‚Äô</li>

<li>Election
<ul>
<li>Election def
<ul>
<li>If a party has the right to end a contract - whether that is a right to terminate because of the other party‚Äôs default or a right to rescind because their consent was vitiated - then that party must choose whether to end the contract.</li>
<li>The process of choosing is called ‚Äòelection‚Äô.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>PART 1 HOW TO ELECT
<ul>
<li>Election is a general legal principle that applies when a person must choose between legally inconsistent outcomes.</li>
<li>When a contract is voidable due to vitiating conduct, the plaintiff must choose (elect) between two legally inconsistent outcomes:
<ul>
<li>Rescind the contract; or</li>
<li>Affirm (and continue to be bound by) the contract.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once the choice is unequivocally made, the plaintiff cannot change their mind.</li>
<li>Eg, if a plaintiff has elected to affirm the contract, then rescission or termination is no longer possible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A binding election requires:
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Full knowledge of the ‚Äòmaterial facts‚Äô (ie, at least knowledge of the vitiating conduct; maybe also knowledge of the right to rescind.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Unequivocal conduct indicating affirmation or rescission/termination</li>
<li>Conduct is judged objectively:
<ul>
<li>there is no need for the plaintiff to subjectively intend to elect.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sargent v ASL Developments Ltd (1974) 131 CLR 634
<ul>
<li>Term in contract for the sale of land provided a right to terminate if certain planning controls were imposed over the land.</li>
<li>The planning controls were imposed.</li>
<li>Despite this, the sellers continued to perform the contract.</li>
<li>32 months later, the sellers purported to terminate the contract, relying on the term.
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe words or conduct ordinarily required to constitute an election must be unequivocal in the sense that it is consistent only with the exercise of one of the two sets of rights and inconsistent with the exercise of the other ‚Ä¶ For an election there need be no actual, subjective intention to elect ‚Ä¶ an election is the effect which the law attributes to conduct justifiable only if such an election had been made</li>

<li>Tropical Traders Ltd v Goonan (1964) 111 CLR 41
<ul>
<li>Contract for the sale of land provided for payment of the price in instalments over 5 years.</li>
<li>Time was of the essence for payment of the balance on 6 January 1963.</li>
<li>6 Jan: Purchaser failed to pay and asked for 3 more months.</li>
<li>Seller: ‚ÄòThe company will not take action under the contract until Monday, 14 January</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tropical Traders Ltd v Goonan (1964) 111 CLR 41
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe company will not take action under the contract until Monday, 14 January but this must be regarded as an act of grace on the part of the Company and without prejudice to and in no way varying the Company‚Äôs right to strict enforcement of the contract.‚Äô</li>

<li>Immer (No 145) Pty Ltd v Uniting Church in Australia Property Trust (NSW) (1993) 182 CLR 26
<ul>
<li>Sale of air rights subject to Council approval by 1 April 1989.</li>
<li>Approval not granted by 1 April: both parties in a position to terminate.</li>
<li>26 June: Immer sends settlement documents to the</li>
<li>Trust under mistaken belief that the Council had approve the transfer.</li>
<li>26 August: Immer terminates the contract.
<ul>
<li>Were its actions consistent only with an intention to keep the agreement on foot and inconsistent with the exercise of the right to rescind</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>‚ÄòIf a party to a contract, faced with the choice of terminating the contract or keeping it on foot, terminates the contract that party will ordinarily have acted in a way that leaves no doubt as to the choice made.‚Äô (41, Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ)
<ul>
<li>‚Äô‚Ä¶ at the heart of election is the idea of confrontation which in turn produces the necessity of making a choice.</li>
<li>But in a case such as the present one, the choice is not merely one of affirming the agreement; it involves as well the abandonment of the right to rescind.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>‚Äô ‚Ä¶ where the right to rescind is a continuing one, it is not so readily concluded that the party entitled to rescind has abandoned that right completely as opposed to taking no action to exercise the right at the time in question. (42, Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ)</li>

<li>Rogue had sold the car to Universal Finance: did Caldwell rescind before this sale?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Restrictions on the right to end a contract
<ul>
<li>Even if a party wants to terminate or rescind a contract, they may find that their right to do so is lost.</li>
<li>Affirmation
<ul>
<li>The right to elect presents the relevant party with two inconsistent choices:
<ul>
<li>either end the contract (ie, terminate or rescind it) or affirm it and continue performing.</li>
<li>If the the party elects to affirm the contract, then the right to end it is lost unless a ‚Äòfresh‚Äô right to end it later accrues.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>RESTRICTIONS: AFFIRMATION
<ul>
<li>The plaintiff must elect to end or affirm a contract when:
<ul>
<li>The contract is breach or repudiated.</li>
<li>Their consent was vitiated.</li>
<li>A contingency is fulfilled providing a right to terminate.</li>
<li>But sometimes the plaintiff‚Äôs choice is restricted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If seller affirms:
<ul>
<li>Right to terminate is surrendered.</li>
<li>Seller can sue for damages.</li>
<li>Parties obliged to continue performing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A second breach will create a fresh right to terminate.</li>
<li>Foran v Wight (1989) 168 CLR 385
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòAlthough he may do so, the other party does not have to accept the repudiation.</li>
<li>He may continue to treat the contract as on foot and hold the party guilty of repudiation to the performance of his obligations.</li>
<li>If those obligations remain unperformed when the time for performance arrives, the anticipatory breach will be converted into an actual breach.</li>
<li>If the other party keeps the contract alive, he does so not only for his own benefit but also for the benefit of the party guilty of repudiation.</li>

</li>
<li>Coastal Estates Pty Ltd v Melevende [1965] VR 433
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòIn my opinion, affirmation as a defence to a claim to rescind a contract rests on the principle that having elected to adhere to a contract after discovery of the falsity of the representations inducing it, the right to rescind is lost.</li>
<li>In other words affirmation is the determination of an election by affirming the contract.</li>
<li>Affirmation may take the form of an express communication from the representee that he has elected to treat the contract as binding, or conduct of his in relation to the contract or its subject matter from which the proper inference is that he has so elected.‚Äô (452, Adam J)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Termination: RESTRICTIONS: Ready, Willing and Able
<ul>
<li>Focusing now on the right to terminate for breach or repudiation, the party who has such a right will not be able to terminate the contract if they are not ready, willing and able to perform it.</li>
<li>A plaintiff who wishes to elect for breach or repudiation must be ‚Äòready, willing and able‚Äô to perform their own obligations at the time of election.
<ul>
<li>Psaltis v Schultz (1948) 76 CLR 547
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòTo be ready and willing to perform a contract a party must not only be disposed to do the act promised but also have the capacity to do it.</li>
<li>But the tenor of the promise will show when and how the act is to be performed and it is to that time and mode of performance that the capacity and disposition to fulfil the promise are to be directed.‚Äô (560, Dixon J)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The extent to which the plaintiff must be ready, willing and able to perform depends upon the circumstances.

<li>Was the plaintiff was due to perform any essential obligations before or at the time of the default?</li>
<li>Had the plaintiff breached the contract?</li>

<li>Rawson v Hobbes (1961) 107 CLR 466
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòOne must be very careful to see that nothing but a substantial incapacity or definitive resolve or decision against doing in the future what the contract requires is counted as an absence of readiness and willingness.‚Äô (481, Dixon J)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Psaltis v Schultz (1948) 76 CLR 547
<ul>
<li>It is enough that he is not presently incapacitated from future performance and is not indisposed to do, when the time comes, what the contract requires.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Foran v Wight (1989) 168 CLR 385
<ul>
<li>Sellers repudiated (anticipatory breach) 2 days before settlement.</li>
<li>Purchasers waited for settlement ‚Äì neither parties attempted to settle.</li>
<li>Purchasers terminated for actual breach 2 days after settlement.</li>
<li>Sellers argued that plaintiffs were not ready, willing and able at the time the purchasers terminated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sharjade Pty Ltd v Commonwealth [2009] NSWCA 373
<ul>
<li>[68] As a matter of principle, it seems to me that the view of Deane J is preferable.</li>
<li>If the only question is whether a purported termination is effective to put an end to the contract so as to discharge both parties from future performance, then anticipatory breach by one will justify termination by the other whether or not the latter is ready and willing to perform.</li>
<li>However, if the latter wants to obtain any relief on the basis of the termination, beyond mere discharge of future obligations, then as part of its cause of action it must prove readiness, willingness and ability. (Hodgson JA, Young JA agreeing at [145])</li>
<li>A further and more difficult question is whether ‚Ä¶ a party who is also in breach of the contract ‚Ä¶ can terminate despite its own breach.
<ul>
<li>The answer is that generally it can, at least unless the obligations breached are interdependent or the breach by the party wishing to terminate has caused the breach that this party wishes to rely on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Foran v Wight (1989) 168 CLR 385
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThey were not required to show that upon the day stipulated for settlement they were ready and willing to tender the purchase price.</li>
<li>They were absolved from the obligation of placing themselves in a position to be able to tender the purchase price upon that day by reason of the representation of the vendors two days earlier.‚Äô (454, Dawson J)
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòAll that the purchasers were required to show was that at the time of the repudiation, that is, at the time they were absolved from future performance, there was not a ‚Äúsubstantial incapacity‚Äù on their part or a ‚Äúdefinitive resolve or decision‚Äù against the performance of their obligations.‚Äô (454, Dawson J)</li>

</li>
<li>Rescission: Restitutio in integrum
<ul>
<li>RESCISSION: INTERVENING THIRD PARTY
<ul>
<li>Focusing now on the right to rescind because of a vitiating factor, rescission will not be allowed if the parties cannot be restored to their pre-contractual positions.</li>
<li>Rescission:
<ul>
<li>Voids the contract.</li>
<li>Obliges the parties to restore each other to their pre- contractual positions.</li>
<li>If the parties cannot be restored, then rescission will be denied.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Example
<ul>
<li>Seller induces purchaser to buy a car with a fraudulent misrepresentation.</li>
<li>Purchaser paints the car a different colour and negligently damages it.</li>
<li>Purchaser discovers fraud.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rescission may be denied if purchaser cannot return the care in the same condition as it was transferred to them.</li>
<li>Contracts tainted by a vitiating factor are voidable, not void.
<ul>
<li>Voidable contracts allow title in property to pass, unless and until the contract is rescinded.</li>
<li>If the contract is not rescinded before that title is passed to an innocent third party, then the right to rescind is lost.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On rescission, ownership of property immediately reverts to original owner (plaintiff).
<ul>
<li>Plaintiff can get property from whomever has possession of it</li>

<li>Actions for debt def
<ul>
<li>When a party (the ‚Äòcontractor‚Äô) earns the right to payment for performance of an obligation.
<ul>
<li>When a contractor earns a right to payment under a contract, the contractor can sue for payment in an action called ‚Äòdebt‚Äô.</li>
<li>That right to payment exists independently of the contract, hence, if the contract is terminated after a right to payment has accrued, then the contractor can still sue on the debt owing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ACTIONS FOR DEBT
<ul>
<li>Contracts typically consist of the provision of goods/services for money.</li>
<li>A right to payment depends upon proper performance.</li>
<li>Construe the contract to determine:</li>
<li>Nature of obligations (entire? Divisible?)</li>
<li>Level of performance required (exact? Substantial?)</li>

<li>Young v Queensland Trustees Ltd (1956) 99 CLR 560
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòA debt recoverable under an indebitatus count was not and is not now conceived of simply as a cause of action for breach of duty or obligation.</li>
<li>In other words it is a mistake to regard the liability to pay a debt of a kind formerly recoverable in debt or indebitatus as no more than the result of a breach of contract, a breach which the creditor must affirmatively allege and prove.‚Äô (569, The Court)</li>

<li>Purchaser ordered 4,950 imperial tons of wheat (5,029 metric tons).</li>
<li>Seller delivered 5,029.025 metric tons of wheat.</li>
<li>‚ÄòNow the excess quantity is trifling, so trifling that it is quite impossible to suppose that any business man would regard it as in any way affecting the substance of the contract or as making the contract any the more or any the less an advantageous contract to enter into.</li>

<li>Hoenig hire Isaacs to decorate his flat for ¬£750.</li>
<li>Hoenig was obliged to pay ‚Äòas the work proceeds, and balance on completion‚Äô.</li>
<li>Isaac sued for the balance on completion of work.</li>
<li>Hoenig refused to pay because a bookshelf and wardrobe door were not properly installed.</li>
<li>‚ÄòThis case raises the familiar question: Was entire performance a condition precedent to payment?
<ul>
<li>That depends on the true construction of the contract.‚Äô (180, Denning LJ)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>‚ÄòIt is, of course, always open to the parties by express words to make entire performance a condition precedent.‚Äô (181, Denning LJ)</li>
<li>‚ÄòI think this contract should be regarded as an ordinary lump sum contract. It was substantially performed.
<ul>
<li>The contractor is entitled, therefore, to the contract price, less a deduction for the defects.‚Äô (181, Denning LJ)</li>

<li>Steele v Tardiani (1946) 72 CLR 386
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòBut it can hardly be denied that the consideration which the employees were to give for the remuneration is firewood cut according to contract and, so to speak, only those billets or sticks can be counted which qualify by substantial or reasonable compliance with the specifications.</li>
<li>In this sense the terms of remuneration are ‚Äúentire‚Äù, or, in other words, each divisible application of the contract is entire and is only satisfied by performance, not partial, but substantially complete.‚Äô (401, Dixon J)</li>

<p>Bolton v Mahadeva [1972] 1 WLR 1009</p>
<ul>
<li>Bolton agreed to install a central heating system in Mahadeva‚Äôs home for ¬£560.</li>
<li>It didn‚Äôt heat the home well and emitted unpleasant fumes.</li>
<li>It would have cost ¬£174 to fix: 30% of the contract price.
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòIf a central heating system when installed is such that it does not heat the house adequately and is such, further, that fumes are given out, so as to make living rooms uncomfortable, and if the putting right of those defects is not something which can be done by some slight amendment of the system, then I think that the contract is not substantially performed.‚Äô (1014, Cairns LJ)</li>
<li>‚ÄòIt is not merely that so very much of the work was shoddy, but it is the general ineffectiveness of it for its primary purpose that leads me to that conclusion.‚Äô (1015, Sachs LJ)</li>

<p>SUMMARY</p>

<li>Entire Contract vs Divisible Contract</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Payments independent of performance
<ul>
<li>Not all rights to payment depend upon the contractor first performing.
<ul>
<li>The parties are free to make payments independent of performance, and such payments are claimable as debts owing at the time(s) provided for in the contract.</li>
<li>A classic example of this is the deposit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>PAYMENTS INDEPENDENT OF PERFORMANCE
<ul>
<li>The right to payment does not have to depend on performance.</li>
<li>Parties can provide that payments are due at any time.</li>
<li>If so, the right to sue in debt arises on the arrival of the due date.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DEPOSITS

<li>Howe v Smith (1884) 27 Ch D 89
<ul>
<li>‚Äô.. a deposit ‚Ä¶ is, according to the ordinary interpretation of business men, a security for the completion of the purchase.‚Äô (98, Bowen LJ)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bot v Ristevski [1981] VR 120
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòI prefer to approach the problem by asking whether an unconditional right to recover and retain the deposit arose before the contract was discharged.</li>
<li>If such a right did arise, it will survive the determination of the contract, and if the money has been paid before discharge the purchaser will not get it back, while if the money has not been paid before discharge the purchaser will be compelled to pay it.‚Äô (124-5, Brooking J)</li>

<li>INSTALMENTS
<ul>
<li>McDonald v Dennys Lascelles Ltd (1933) 48 CLR 457
<ul>
<li>Contract for the purchase of land by instalments.</li>
<li>Title transferred on payment of all instalments.
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòIn Reynolds v. Fury, the Full Court of Victoria, after a very full examination of the authorities, decided that instalments of purchase money, which, by the conditions of a contract of sale of land are payable at fixed times before conveyance, become immediately recoverable as debts or liquidated demands, notwithstanding that the sale has not yet been completed by conveyance.‚Äô (476, Dixon J)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>‚ÄòWhen a contract stipulates for payment of part of the purchase money in advance, the purchaser relying only on the vendor‚Äôs promise to give him a conveyance, the vendor is entitled to enforce payment before the time has arrived for conveying the land; yet his title to retain the money has been considered not to be absolute but conditional upon the subsequent completion of the contract.‚Äô (477, Dixon J)</li>

<p>Introduction to damages and specific performance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damages</p>
<ul>
<li>As foreshadowed in tutorial discussions, damagesLinks to an external site. are also available for breach of contract.</li>
<li>They are available for any breach; the right to them does not depend upon the classification of the term.</li>
<li>So, damages are available for breaches of ‚Äòmere‚Äô warranties.</li>
<li>Damages seek to provide a money equivalent of performance in place of the defective performance provided by the defendant.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specific performance</p>
<ul>
<li>Damages is the remedy provided by the common law.</li>
<li>Equity can also provide a remedy: specific performance.</li>
<li>It is also available to remedy an actual - or threatened - breach of contract.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>REMEDIES</p>
<ul>
<li>DAMAGES
<ul>
<li>GUIDING PRINCIPLE
<ul>
<li>Robinson v Harmon (1848) 154 ER 363
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe rule of the common law is, that where a party sustains a loss by reason of a breach of contract, he is, so far as money can do it, to be placed in the same situation, with respect to damages, as if the contract had been performed.‚Äô (365, Parke B)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>EXPECTATION DAMAGES
<ul>
<li>Commonwealth v Amann Aviation Pty Ltd (1992) 174 CLR 64
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe award of damages for breach of contract protects a plaintiff‚Äôs expectation of receiving the defendant‚Äôs performance.</li>
<li>the amount of damages awarded will be commensurate with the plaintiff‚Äôs expectation, objectively determined,</li>
<li>That is to say, a plaintiff must prove, on the balance of probabilities, that his or her expectation of a certain outcome, as a result of performance of the contract, had a likelihood of attainment rather than being mere expectation.‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ASSESSMENT OF DAMAGES
<ul>
<li>Moore v Scenic Tours Pty Ltd [2020] HCA 17
<ul>
<li>[64] ‚Ä¶ a fundamental difference between two components of compensatory damages for breach of contract,</li>
<li>Those components are compensation directly for the performance interest and compensation for consequential losses</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Example 1
<ul>
<li>Purchaser agrees to buy good for $10,000.</li>
<li>On date of delivery, purchaser breaches the contract by refusing to take and pay for the good.</li>
<li>On the date of breach, the market value of the good is $9,000.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Example 1: Assessment
<ul>
<li>Expectation interest is compensated by awarding $1,000.</li>
<li>This puts the seller in the position that they would have been in had the contract been performed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Example 2
<ul>
<li>Purchaser agrees to buy good for $10,000.</li>
<li>On date of delivery, purchaser breaches the contract by refusing to take and pay for the good.</li>
<li>On the date of breach, the market value of the good is $9,000.</li>
<li>Purchaser spends $250 storing the good before selling it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Example 2: Assessment
<ul>
<li>Expectation interest: $1,000; and</li>
<li>Consequential loss: $250</li>
<li>This puts the seller in the position that they would have been in had the contract been performed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CAUSATION
<ul>
<li>The plaintiff must show that the loss that they are claiming for was caused by the breach of contract.</li>
<li>March v E &amp; MH Stramare (1991) 171 CLR 506
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe common law tradition is that what was the cause of a particular occurrence is a question of fact which ‚Äúmust be determined by applying common sense to the facts of each particular case‚Äù ‚Ä¶‚Äô (Mason CJ)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>REMOTENESS
<ul>
<li>Even if the plaintiff proves that loss was caused by a breach of contract, then the defendant will not be liable if the loss is too remote.</li>
<li>Test: ‚Äòreasonable contemplation‚Äô test.</li>
<li>Hadley v Baxendale (1854) 156 ER 145
<ul>
<li>fairly and reasonably be considered arising naturally, that is, according to the usual course of things, from such breach of contract itself, or such as may reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties at the time they made the contract,</li>
<li>If special circumstances under which the contract was actually made were communicated by the plaintiffs to the defendants, and thus known to both parties, the damages resulting from the breach of such a contract, which they would reasonably contemplate, would be the amount of injury which would ordinarily follow from a breach of contract under these special circumstances so known and communicated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CONCLUSION
<ul>

<p>BAILMENT</p>

<li>Hobbs v Petersham Transport Co Pty Ltd (1971) 124 CLR 220
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòA bailment comes into existence upon the delivery of goods of one person, the bailor, into the possession of another person, the bailee, upon a promise, express or implied, that they will be redelivered to the bailor or dealt with in a stipulated way.‚Äô (238, Windeyer J)</li>

<p>Morris v C W Martin &amp; Sons Ltd [1966] 1 QB 716</p>
<ul>
<li>‚ÄúOnce a man has taken charge of goods as a bailee for reward, it is his duty to take reasonable care to keep them safe:
<ul>
<li>and he cannot escape that duty be delegating it to his servant.
<ul>
<li>If the goods are lost or damaged, whilst they are in his possession, he is liable unless he can show - and the burden is on him to show - that the loss or damage occurred without any neglect or default or misconduct of himself or of any of the servants to whom he delegated his duty.‚Äù</li>

<p>City of Sydney v West (1965) 114 CLR 481</p>

<li>‚ÄúBut in the present case what is important, I think, is to recognize that the evident purpose of the clause is to free the appellant from all the responsibility (for loss and damage) to which otherwise its assumption of the position of bailee would have subjected it.</li>
<li>The clause is part and parcel of the bargain by which the bailment was created and the reciprocal rights and obligations of the parties as bailor and bailee were regulated.
<ul>
<li>The concern of the clause, as read in the setting in which it came to be agreed upon (assuming that it was agreed upon), was with the legal responsibility which the appellant‚Äôs acceptance of the bailment should entail.‚Äù</li>

<li>West v AGC (Advances) Ltd (1986) 5 NSWLR 610

<li>‚ÄúThe Contracts Review Act 1980 is revolutionary legislation whose evident purpose is to overcome the common law‚Äôs failure to provide a comprehensive doctrinal framework to deal with ‚Äòunjust‚Äô contracts.‚Äù (621, McHugh JA)</li>

<li>Someone in a position to guarantee the truth of a statement more likely to intend contractual liability for it.</li>
<li>Oscar Chess Ltd v Williams [1957] 1 WLR 370
<ul>
<li>Williams sold a ‚Äò1948 Morris 10 Saloon‚Äô to Oscar Chess for lbs 290.</li>
<li>Williams had represented that the car was a 1948 Model Morris based on registration book.</li>
<li>Car was a 1939 model worth lbs 175.</li>
<li>Did Williams promise that the car was a 1948 model?

<ul>
<li>Actionable representation:
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>False pre-contractual statement of past/present fact (not an opinion or statement that something will happen);</li>
</ol>
</li>

<ol start="2">
<li>Made by the defendant to induce the plaintiff into the contract;</li>

<li>TYPES AND REMEDIES</li>
<li>THREE TYPES
<ul>
<li>Innocent</li>
<li>Fraudulent</li>
<li>Negligent</li>
<li>The type determines whether damages are available in addition to rescission.</li>
<li>Only fraudulent and innocent assessed in this subject.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION / DECEIT
<ul>
<li>Common law allows rescission for fraudulent misrepresentation.</li>
<li>Remedy
<ul>
<li>Plaintiff can choose:
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Rescission (Restoration to pre-contractual position) or</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>Damages (Affirm the contract and sue in tort of deceit).</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Magill v Magill (2006) 226 CLR 551
<ul>
<li>The modern tort of deceit will be established where a plaintiff can</li>
<li>show five elements of deceit:
<ul>
<li>first, that the defendant made a false representation;</li>
<li>secondly, that the defendant made the representation with the knowledge that it was false, or that the defendant was reckless or careless as to whether the representation was false or not</li>
<li>thirdly, that the defendant made the representation with the intention that it be relied upon by the plaintiff;</li>
<li>fourthly, that the plaintiff acted in reliance on the false representation; and</li>
<li>fifthly, that the plaintiff suffered damage which was caused by reliance on the false representation.</li>

<ul>
<li>‚Äô‚Ä¶ if fraud be proved, the motive of the person guilty of it is immaterial.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>INNOCENT MISREPRESENTATION
<ul>
<li>Redgrave v Hurd (1881) 20 Ch D 1
<ul>
<li>Where the defendant honestly believed the statement was correct / was not aware that it was false.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rescission is the only remedy for innocent misrepresentation ‚Äì no damages.</li>
<li>Innocent misrepresentation is the ‚Äúdefault finding‚Äù.
<ul>
<li>The plaintiff has the onus of proving any fraud or negligence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Remedy = rescission of the contract.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ELEMENTS of Non Est Factum
<ul>
<li>Legal instrument (contract, deed, etc) signed by a party;</li>
<li>Signer unable to read/understand the instrument</li>
<li>Signer:</li>
<li>Subjectively mistaken about the legal effect of the instrument; or</li>
<li>Unable to comprehend the legal effect of the instrument.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Two forms of unfair pressure recognised at general law:
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Duress (common law)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>two elements of duress:
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>pressure amounting to compulsion of the will of the victim; and</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>the illegitimacy of the pressure exerted</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Duress involves illegitimate pressure amounting to compulsion</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>Undue influence (equity)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Plaintiff might be capable of looking after own interests, but is subject to (elements of undue influence):
<ul>
<li>pressure</li>
<li>influence</li>
<li>manipulation</li>
<li>misinformation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>such that the plaintiff cannot be said to have exercised free will.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Undue influence involves a skewing of free will but not necessarily through illegitimate means.
<ul>
<li>Unconscionable conduct involves taking advantage of a vulnerable party; often considered an extension or subset of undue influence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Undue influence + unconscionable conduct
<ul>
<li>Facts suggest that plaintiff:
<ul>
<li>was at a special disadvantage vis-a-vis the defendant; AND</li>
<li>influence was applied by the defendant such that the plaintiff did not exercise his or her own free will.</li>
<li>D must show signing is fair, just, and reasonable</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Undue Influence
<ul>
<li>Johnson v Buttress (1936) 56 CLR 113
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe jurisdiction of a court of equity to set aside gifts [and contracts] inter vivos which have been procured by undue influence is exercised where
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>undue influence is proved as a fact, or [‚Äòactual undue influence‚Äô]</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>where, undue influence being presumed from the relations existing between the parties, the presumption has not been rebutted.‚Äô [‚Äòpresumed undue influence‚Äô]</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Duress vs Undue influence
<ul>
<li>The defense of duress exists to protect against contracts that are obtained by some type of threat or coercion.</li>
<li>The defense of undue influence exists for a more specialized role, to protect against assent obtained by unfair persuasion.</li>

<ul>
<li>Consideration
<ul>
<li>The second element necessary for contract formation is consideration</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consideration Essential elements - Bargain theory authority on Consideration
<ul>
<li>Case: Australian Woollen Mills Pty Ltd v Commonwealth (1954) 92 CLR 424 (Privy Council); (1955) 93 CLR 546 (High Court of Australia)</li>
<li>Jurisdiction: Privy Council; High Court of Australia</li>
<li>Facts: Australian Woollen Mills Pty Ltd (AWM) claimed a unilateral contract arose from the Commonwealth government‚Äôs wool subsidy scheme.
<ul>
<li>The scheme subsidized wool purchases for woollen product manufacturers after World War II to ensure low prices.</li>
<li>The Commonwealth promised subsidies to manufacturers buying domestic-use wool.</li>
<li>AWM purchased wool based on this promise but later repaid excess subsidies due to scheme discontinuation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Procedural History: AWM sued Commonwealth for recovery of repaid subsidies and unpaid subsidies on certain purchases</li>
<li>Issue Raised: Whether the letters from Commonwealth constituted a binding offer to form unilateral contracts with manufacturers like AWM.</li>
<li>Legal Reasoning and Ratio:
<ul>
<li>The alleged contracts were of the unilateral type, with acceptance through performance.</li>
<li>To establish a contract, the statement must be offered as consideration for an act, with a quid pro quo relationship between the statement and the act.</li>
<li>In cases like these, the presence of an implied or express request by the alleged promisor is essential to determine the existence of an offer.</li>
<li>The intention to create a legally enforceable duty must be present in the offer.</li>
<li>An implied request can provide a useful test for determining a true offer and acceptance for contract formation.</li>
<li>In this case, the letters from the Commonwealth were statements of policy, not contractual offers. The scheme was more administrative than contractual.</li>
<li>The presence of a request does not automatically establish a contract; it depends on the intention to create an obligation.</li>
<li>Consideration must be sufficient, not adequate
<ul>
<li>(consideration definition).</li>
<li>a contract should be a bargain supported by consideration in the nature of a quid pro quo</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ratio
<ul>
<li>ratio decidendi of Australian Woollen Mills Pty Ltd v Commonwealth is that the expenditure of money in reliance on an announcement by the government that it would pay a subsidy to a manufacturer on wool purchased and used for local manufacture is not itself sufficient to create a contract to pay the subsidy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Result: The court dismissed AWM‚Äôs claim, ruling that no binding contracts were constituted, and the Commonwealth‚Äôs letters were statements of policy rather than contractual offers. The appeal was also dismissed by the Privy Council.</li>

<ul>
<li>duties arising from bargains entered between free parties were to be enforced, not duties deriving from suggested moral obligations such as those deriving from relationships</li>

<ul>
<li>Three situations
<ul>
<li>a promise to transfer property subject to the occurrence of an event or condition
<ul>
<li>promise will not be enforceable even if the event or condition [183] occurs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>a promise to transfer property after which the promisor allows the promisee to act to his detriment in reliance on the promise.
<ul>
<li>equity may prevent the promisor insisting on his strict rights and may enforce the promise</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>where the promise contains an express or implied request by the promisor to do an act or fulfill a condition</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Frustration
<ul>
<li>subdivision is not a legal impossibility; it is possible that in all the circumstances the council might permit the land to be subdivided to enable the title to lot B to pass to the plaintiff</li>

<ul>
<li>The McDivitts have a contractual duty to do everything necessary on their part to enable the plaintiff to have the benefit of the contract</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MAHONEY JA: [175] In my opinion, the transaction between the parties constituted a contract
<ul>
<li>rezoning was a condition subsequent to the contractual arrangements mad
<ul>
<li>Rezoning was no a condition of the contract or that, if it was, the contract has been terminated by failure of it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adequacy OF CONSIDERATION
<ul>
<li>adequacy of consideration refers to its intrinsic value
<ul>
<li>Adequate consideration vs sufficient or good consideration</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Woolworths Ltd v Kelly (1991) 22 NSWLR 189
<ul>
<li>If courts were to entertain disputes concerning the adequacy, or inadequacy, of consideration for a bargain, and if such issues were justiciable, they would lead to litigation prone to open up a vast territory of evidence.</li>
<li>Bargains are too uncertain</li>
<li>Economic freedom from paternalistic courts</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SUFFICIENCY OF CONSIDERATION
<ul>
<li>Past consideration
<ul>
<li>Past consideration is not considered sufficient consideration.
<ul>
<li>Thus, if P performs an apparently gratuitous service for D and D later promises to pay P for that service, D‚Äôs promise will not be enforceable unless specifically agreed.</li>

<li>Case Summary: Foakes v Beer (1884) 9 App Cas 605 (House of Lords)
<ul>
<li>Appeal Information: This was an appeal from the Court of Appeal.</li>
<li>Facts:
<ul>
<li>On 11 August 1875, Beer obtained a judgment against Foakes for a debt amounting to ¬£2 090 19s.</li>
<li>On 21 December 1876, a memorandum of agreement was made and signed by Foakes and Beer.</li>
<li>This agreement specified that if Foakes paid ¬£500 immediately and further installments of ¬£150 on specified dates until the full sum was paid off, Beer would not proceed with the judgment.</li>
<li>By June 1882, Beer took out a summons to proceed on the judgment, leading to a trial on the matter of the debt‚Äôs status.</li>
<li>It was determined at trial that Foakes had paid all required instalments but Beer claimed unpaid interest.</li>
<li>Cave J found in favour of Foakes, believing Beer could not execute any sum due to the agreement.</li>
<li>The Queen‚Äôs Bench Division upheld the decision. However, the Court of Appeal reversed it, favoring Beer‚Äôs claim for the interest.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Judgment (Earl of Selbourne LC):
<ul>
<li>[610] Raised doubts about whether the agreement meant waiving the interest Beer was entitled to by law.</li>
<li>[611] Stressed that the agreement could not be legally enforced against Beer unless there was consideration.</li>
<li>The main question was whether paying a lesser amount than the full debt could be considered legal satisfaction for the whole debt.</li>
<li>Referenced the doctrine stated by Sir Edward Coke in Pinnel‚Äôs case from 1602. According to this, paying a lesser amount could not satisfy a larger debt.</li>
<li>The doctrine made a distinction between agreements under seal and those not under seal. The former is binding, while the latter requires consideration.</li>
<li>[614] The creditor‚Äôs benefit from getting part of their money does not serve as legal consideration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Lords (LORD WATSON, LORD FITZGERALD):
<ul>
<li>Both concurred with Earl of Selbourne LC‚Äôs conclusions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>LORD BLACKBURN:
<ul>
<li>[622] Emphasized that many men of business would see value in prompt payment of part of a debt rather than waiting for full payment, especially when there‚Äôs doubt about the debtor‚Äôs solvency.</li>
<li>Had reservations about fully agreeing with the majority opinion but did not elucidate his full dissent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Decision: The appeal was dismissed, upholding the Court of Appeal‚Äôs decision in favor of Beer.</li>

<p>Williams v Roffey Bros &amp; Nicholls (Contractors)</p>
<ul>
<li>Court &amp; Date: Court of Appeal, 1991</li>
<li>Parties:
<ul>
<li>Plaintiff/Appellant: Williams</li>
<li>Defendant/Respondent: Roffey Bros &amp; Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Facts:
<ul>
<li>Roffey Bros held a contract to refurbish 27 flats.</li>
<li>Williams was subcontracted by Roffey Bros for carpentry for ¬£20,000.</li>
<li>Williams faced financial difficulties due to the low agreed price.</li>
<li>To ensure completion and avoid penalties for delay, Roffey Bros orally agreed to pay Williams an extra ¬£10,300, at ¬£575 per flat.</li>
<li>Williams continued work but stopped after seven weeks when he had only been paid ¬£1,500 by the defendants.</li>
<li>Roffey Bros did not pay the outstanding balance.</li>
<li>Roffey Bros then hired other carpenters to finish the work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Issue:
<ul>
<li>Was there consideration for Roffey Bros‚Äô promise to pay Williams an additional ¬£10,300, at the rate of ¬£575 per completed flat?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Holding:
<ul>
<li>Yes, there was consideration for the promise.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reasoning:
<ul>
<li>The main contention was the traditional legal principle from Stilk v Myrick that performing an existing contractual obligation is not good consideration for a new promise.</li>
<li>It was recognized that the promise to pay more was in both parties‚Äô interests.</li>
<li>Roffey Bros derived practical benefits,
<ul>
<li>such as ensuring Williams continued his work, avoiding penalties, and avoiding the costs of hiring new carpenters.</li>
<li>Practical benefits means that the benefit of not receiving the full amount is still worth it because they are providing enough of a service to get by</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>GLIDEWELL LJ outlined a proposition that refined the traditional principle, stating that if a party obtains a benefit from a promise, and it isn‚Äôt due to duress or fraud, it can be considered good consideration.</li>
<li>Based on these findings, the promise by Roffey Bros was supported by valuable consideration and is enforceable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Judgment:
<ul>
<li>The appeal was dismissed. Williams‚Äô agreement with Roffey Bros was legally binding and enforceable.</li>

<ul>
<li>Jurisdiction: Binding in New South Wales.</li>
<li>Procedural History:
<ul>
<li>Plaintiffs were tenants of a fruit and vegetable shop owned by the defendant.</li>
<li>A larger competing fruit and vegetable shop was introduced in the same shopping center, threatening plaintiffs‚Äô ability to pay rent.</li>
<li>Defendant initially promised reduced rent but later sought to withdraw the promise.</li>
<li>Plaintiffs sought a declaration that the reduced rent promise was binding.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Original Dispute:
<ul>
<li>Plaintiffs‚Äô ability to pay rent was threatened due to competition from a larger tenant.</li>
<li>Defendant initially promised reduced rent but later wanted to withdraw this promise.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Current Reason for Trial:
<ul>
<li>To determine whether the reduced rent promise by the landlord was binding.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Material Facts:
<ul>
<li>Plaintiffs were tenants of a shop owned by the defendant.</li>
<li>A larger competitor tenant was introduced in the shopping center, endangering plaintiffs‚Äô ability to pay rent.</li>

<li>SANTOW J discussed the application of the ‚ÄúWilliams v Roffey‚Äù case and debated the concept of consideration, economic duress, and fairness.</li>
<li>Critiqued the traditional notion of consideration and proposed a broader approach based on practical benefit or detriment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Legal Reasoning and Ratio:
<ul>
<li>The judge re-examined the principles of consideration and economic duress.</li>
<li>Proposed that practical benefits or detriments could suffice as consideration.</li>
<li>Consideration need not be strictly commensurate with the value exchanged.</li>
<li>Proposed a reformulated approach for determining enforceability based on practical benefits or detriments and fairness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Result:
<ul>
<li>The judge concluded that, subject to re-casting the elements of the ‚ÄúWilliams v Roffey‚Äù case, a practical benefit or detriment could suffice as consideration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The reduced rent promise was found to be binding based on the practical benefit to the landlord and detriment to the tenants.</li>

<p>Case Summary (Detailed)</p>
<ul>
<li>Name of the Case and Citation:
<ul>
<li>Williams v Roffey Bros &amp; Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd [1991] 1 QB 1</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jurisdiction:
<ul>
<li>England and Wales (Court of Appeal)</li>
<li>Binding within its jurisdiction and persuasive in many common law jurisdictions globally.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Procedural History:
<ul>
<li>Williams initially brought the case to the Queen‚Äôs Bench Division seeking the extra payment as promised by Roffey Bros.</li>
<li>The matter was then appealed to the Court of Appeal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Original Dispute:
<ul>
<li>The initial disagreement was concerning the amount payable under a carpentry contract.</li>
<li>Williams struggled to complete the work at the originally agreed price due to unforeseen financial hardships.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Current Reason for Trial:
<ul>
<li>The appeal sought to determine whether Roffey Bros‚Äô promise to pay extra, despite no new consideration being apparent, was enforceable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Material Facts:
<ul>
<li>Williams and Roffey Bros entered into a contract where Williams was to provide carpentry services for a predetermined price.</li>
<li>Due to unforeseen financial constraints, Williams approached Roffey Bros, indicating he could not finish the work at the agreed price.</li>
<li>To avoid the inconvenience and potential additional costs of sourcing a new carpenter, Roffey Bros agreed to pay an additional sum per flat completed.</li>
<li>Roffey Bros, despite witnessing Williams continue his work with the understanding of the new agreement, did not pay the promised additional amounts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Issue Raised by the Material Facts:
<ul>
<li>The primary legal question was whether the promise by Roffey Bros to pay more, without any apparent fresh consideration, constituted an enforceable agreement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Precedences:
<ul>
<li>The court revisited Stilk v Myrick (1809), where it was ruled that a party‚Äôs promise to perform a duty they‚Äôre already contractually obligated to perform doesn‚Äôt amount to valid consideration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tests:
<ul>
<li>The court explored if Roffey Bros derived a ‚Äúpractical benefit‚Äù from the revised terms with Williams, even if Williams was only carrying out his existing duty.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Words and Phrases Considered:
<ul>
<li>Key terms assessed included ‚ÄúConsideration‚Äù, ‚ÄúPractical benefit‚Äù, and ‚ÄúEconomic duress‚Äù.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What Each Judge Thought:
<ul>
<li>All judges in the Court of Appeal, while noting the principles from Stilk v Myrick, agreed that in modern commerce, if a party receives a practical benefit from varied terms, even if there‚Äôs no new consideration in the classic sense, that can make the varied terms enforceable.</li>
<li>They recognized the commercial reality and the practical benefit derived by Roffey Bros in ensuring the continued services of Williams.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Legal Reasoning and Ratio of the Case:
<ul>
<li>The court emphasized that the doctrine of consideration shouldn‚Äôt be a tool for injustice.</li>
<li>If one party derives a practical benefit from varied terms, even if those terms merely ensure the performance of an existing duty, such an agreement can be enforceable.</li>
<li>The evolution of business practices and the need for commercial efficacy played a role in this decision.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Result:
<ul>
<li>The Court of Appeal ruled in favor of Williams, holding that Roffey Bros must honor their promise to pay the additional amounts as they derived a genuine practical benefit from the revised agreement.</li>
<li>The potential inconvenience and additional costs they avoided by not having to find a new carpenter were deemed significant.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Re Selectmove Ltd [1995] 1 WLR 474</p>
<ul>
<li>if the principle from ‚ÄúWilliams v Roffey Bros‚Äù (i.e., a promise to perform an existing contractual obligation can be good consideration if the promisor gains a practical benefit) were extended to the obligation to make payment, it would essentially negate the principle set in ‚ÄúFoakes v Beer.‚Äù
<ul>
<li>Foakes v beer principle: if you owe someone money and they agree to let you pay less to settle the entire debt, that agreement isn‚Äôt enforceable unless there‚Äôs something additional given in return.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Court of Appeal can‚Äôt overrule or sidestep ‚ÄúFoakes v Beer‚Äù based on the principles from ‚ÄúWilliams v Roffey Bros.</li>
<li>Need higher authority to evaluate</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Duty owed to a third party</p>
<ul>
<li>A promise to perform an act which the promisor is under an existing duty to a third party to perform may constitute good consideration.
<ul>
<li>A‚Äôs promise to B to perform a duty which A is already contractually obliged to perform for C
<ul>
<li>May = consideration</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Significance &amp; Precedents Set for the Future:
<ul>
<li>The case of Pao On v Lau Yiu Long is significant for several reasons:
<ul>
<li>Clarification on Consideration: The case delved into the nuances of valid consideration, specifically examining whether fulfilling a pre-existing duty can serve as valid consideration.
<ul>
<li>This establishes a clearer boundary for future commercial transactions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Duress vs. Commercial Pressure: One of the most impactful outcomes of this case was the distinction it drew between contracts formed under genuine duress (coercion of will) and those formed under mere commercial pressure.
<ul>
<li>This ensures that not every aggressive negotiation or hard bargaining situation can be used as grounds to set aside a contract.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Upholding Contract Sanctity: By reinforcing the principle that contracts are to be respected unless there are clear undermining factors, the case sent a strong message about the importance of commercial agreements and the legal system‚Äôs commitment to upholding them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Overall, Pao On v Lau Yiu Long sets important precedents for commercial law, especially in situations where the validity of contracts and agreements is under scrutiny due to external pressures or perceived threats.
<ul>
<li>It provides valuable guidance for future cases where the distinction between genuine duress and mere commercial pressure is in question.</li>

<ul>
<li>Intention
<ul>
<li>The third element of contract formation is that the parties must manifest an intention to create legal relations.
<ul>
<li>parties may reach a clear and certain agreement that satisfies the consideration requirement, but may not be intended to create legal relations:
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Where an agreement is made in a commercial context, a question may arise whether the parties intend to make an honourable, rather than legal commitment.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>The issue may arise in a social or domestic context.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>An agreement to help a friend to move some furniture in return for dinner involves an exchange of promises, but is clearly not intended to be legally binding.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An agreement relating to more substantial matters, such as employment or the sale of valuable property, may be intended to attract legal consequences even when it is made with a close relative.</li>
<li>
<ol start="3">
<li>An issue of intention to contract may arise where an agreement is made between a government and an individual.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The implementation of government policy may, for example, lead a government to reach an agreement with a particular individual to provide some assistance.</li>
<li>The fact that the individual is providing something in return for that assistance does not necessarily mean that the parties intend to make a contract.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="4">
<li>Where parties reach a preliminary agreement, the question may arise whether the parties intend to be bound immediately, or not until some time in the future when the parties have finalised some outstanding issues or recorded their agreement in a more formal manner.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>certain types of agreements are presumed to be intended to be binding, while others are presumed not to be made with such an intention.</li>
<li>A person denying the enforceability of a commercial agreement has been said to bear the onus of proving that the parties did not intend legal consequences.

<li>Case Name and Citation:
<ul>
<li>Ermogenous v Greek Orthodox Community of SA Inc [2002] HCA 8.</li>
<li>Jurisdiction:
<ul>
<li>High Court of Australia - binding within Australia.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Procedural History:
<ul>
<li>Archbishop Ermogenous initiated the case seeking employment benefits.</li>
<li>The trial court ruled in favor of the Greek Orthodox Community of SA.</li>
<li>The decision was overturned by the Supreme Court of South Australia.</li>
<li>The matter was then appealed to the High Court.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Original Dispute:
<ul>
<li>The primary question was whether there existed a contractual relationship between Archbishop Ermogenous and the Greek Orthodox Community of SA Inc that could give rise to employment benefits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Current Reason for Trial:
<ul>
<li>The appeal before the High Court was to ascertain if such a contractual relationship was legally recognized.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Material Facts:
<ul>
<li>Archbishop Ermogenous received an offer of employment which he accepted.</li>
<li>While their relationship was primarily spiritual, there were stipulated duties and compensations, leading to a contention of whether it was contractual.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Issue Raised by the Material Facts:
<ul>
<li>Does a spiritual calling and relationship exclude the possibility of a legally enforceable contractual relationship?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Precedences:
<ul>
<li>The case referenced precedents such as Rogers v Booth and Lewery v Salvation Army, which dealt with similar issues.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tests:
<ul>
<li>The court looked at the objective intentions of the parties.</li>
<li>They examined if there was a clear offer, acceptance, and consideration that would make up a valid contract.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Words and Phrases Considered:
<ul>
<li>‚ÄúContractual intention‚Äù, ‚Äúspiritual duties‚Äù, ‚Äúenforceable rights‚Äù, ‚Äúoffer‚Äù, ‚Äúacceptance‚Äù, and ‚Äúconsideration‚Äù.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What Each Judge Thought:
<ul>
<li>While nuances between judges‚Äô opinions might exist, the High Court generally acknowledged that a spiritual relationship doesn‚Äôt preclude a legal contract.</li>
<li>They noted that the terms between the Archbishop and the Greek Orthodox Community were more than mere spiritual obligations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Legal Reasoning and Ratio of the Case:
<ul>
<li>The Court emphasized that the determination of a contract doesn‚Äôt rest solely on the nature of the duties (spiritual vs. secular).</li>
<li>It is about the intention of the parties.</li>
<li>If the terms are clear, providing legal rights and duties, it can be considered a contract even if it‚Äôs within a religious context.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Result:
<ul>
<li>The High Court allowed the appeal, meaning they recognized the possibility of a contractual relationship between Archbishop Ermogenous and the Greek Orthodox Community of SA.</li>

<li>Banque Brussels Lambert v Australian National Industries Case Summary:</li>
<li>Case Name: Banque Brussels Lambert v Australian National Industries (1989) 21 NSWLR 502</li>
<li>Procedural history:
<ul>
<li>The case has progressed through lower courts where the nature and implications of the ‚Äúletter of comfort‚Äù have been debated.</li>
<li>It follows the line of cases such as Kleinwort Benson and Edwards v Skyways Ltd that deal with the enforceability of certain contractual terms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Original dispute:
<ul>
<li>The dispute initially centered around the interpretation of a ‚Äúletter of comfort‚Äù provided by ANI during financial negotiations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Current reason for trial:
<ul>
<li>The court was asked to determine whether the statements made in the ‚Äúletter of comfort‚Äù were legally binding promises or mere representations, and if ANI had indeed breached any such promises.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Material facts:
<ul>
<li>ANI and Banque Brussels Lambert were involved in a financial negotiation regarding a US$1 million facility.</li>
<li>Upon the bank‚Äôs insistence, this was increased to a US$5 million facility, contingent upon ANI providing a ‚Äúletter of comfort‚Äù to give assurance of the deal‚Äôs soundness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Issue raised by the material facts:
<ul>
<li>Were the statements made in the ‚Äúletter of comfort‚Äù legally enforceable promises?
<ul>
<li>If so, did ANI breach these promises?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Precedences:
<ul>
<li>The court looked to prior decisions like Edwards v Skyways Ltd, Kleinwort Benson [1988] 1 WLR 799, and Chemco Leasing SpA v Redifusion plc.</li>
<li>These cases provided guidance on when seemingly non-binding terms might be enforced and the intent behind such terms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tests:
<ul>
<li>The court sought to identify:
<ul>
<li>If the statements in the ‚Äúletter of comfort‚Äù bore any promissory intent.</li>
<li>Whether ANI and Banque Brussels Lambert had an understanding that these terms were binding.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Words and Phrases Considered:
<ul>
<li>The court scrutinized phrases such as ‚ÄúLetter of comfort,‚Äù evaluating its typical usage in the financial sector.</li>
<li>Additionally, terms like ‚ÄúIntention‚Äù and ‚ÄúPromise‚Äù were analyzed to determine their weight in the given context.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What each judge thought:
<ul>
<li>While individual opinions might have varied in nuance, the judges largely agreed that commercial transactions should not be nullified based on mere semantics.</li>
<li>They leaned towards upholding the weight of commercial intent over strict linguistic interpretation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Legal reasoning and the ratio:
<ul>
<li>The court‚Äôs rationale was underpinned by the notion that commercial bargains, especially those involving significant stakes, should be honored.</li>
<li>If statements within such bargains have a promissory shade, they ought to be seen as binding, barring clear evidence to the contrary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Result:
<ul>
<li>The court found ANI liable, holding that certain statements within the ‚Äúletter of comfort‚Äù bore binding intent and that ANI had breached them.</li>

<li>Todd v Nicol
<ul>
<li>intention to create legal relations.
<ul>
<li>voyage by the plaintiffs to Australia to reside with the defendant at her home.</li>
<li>The discourse touches upon various legal principles surrounding contracts, including:
<ul>
<li>Offer and Acceptance:
<ul>
<li>A contract is formed when there‚Äôs an offer by one party and acceptance by another.</li>
<li>This offer and acceptance can be explicit or implied from conduct or language.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consideration:
<ul>
<li>For a contract to be binding, there must be something of value exchanged between the parties, known as consideration.</li>
<li>Consideration can take many forms such as a right, interest, benefit, or even forbearance or responsibility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Intention:
<ul>
<li>The parties must intend the agreement to be legally binding.</li>
<li>This intention can be explicit or implicit.</li>
<li>Factors like language used, the situation of the parties, and the surrounding circumstances can indicate the presence or absence of such intention.</li>
<li>In some situations, legal enforceability is presumed, especially in business arrangements.</li>
<li>However, in personal or domestic arrangements, such presumption may be doubtful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Certainty:
<ul>
<li>The terms of a contract must be clear.</li>
<li>If the terms are vague, uncertain, or still subject to negotiation, it might be unenforceable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>License:
<ul>
<li>The plaintiffs were given a licence to reside with the defendant.</li>
<li>The text examines the revocability of this licence and the conditions under which it becomes irrevocable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implication of Terms:
<ul>
<li>Sometimes, terms are not explicitly stated but are implied to make the contract operational according to the intention of the parties.</li>
<li>The terms must be necessary to the nature of the contract and directly related to its purpose.</li>

<ul>
<li>Appeal from the Supreme Court of Western Australia</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What the original dispute was
<ul>
<li>Cameron (the respondent) and Mr and Mrs Masters (the appellants) signed a document whereby Cameron agreed to sell and the Masters agreed to buy for ¬£17,500 a certain property owned by Cameron.</li>
<li>The purchasers encountered financial difficulties, denied that they were legally bound to purchase the property, and sought to recover the deposit</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Current reason for trial
<ul>
<li>Is the document on its true construction constitutes a binding contract between the respondent and the appellants, or only a record of terms upon which the signatories were agreed as a basis for the negotiation of a contract</li>
</ul>

<li>Or the intention of the parties is not to make a concluded bargain at all, unless and until they execute a formal contract.

<ul>
<li>Intro, Completeness
<ul>
<li>certainty and completeness
<ul>
<li>if the parties have entered into a contract, then it must contain enough terms to function properly,</li>
<li>and those terms must be expressed adequately clearly so that a court can enforce them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Introduction
<ul>
<li>How certain do the terms of an agreement have to be before the law will recognise it to be a legally binding contract?
<ul>
<li>Difficult (if not impossible) for parties to anticipate and provide for every contingency.
<ul>
<li>Also can be difficult for parties to articulate themselves so there is only one interpretation and no ambiguity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Raises issues of sufficiency ‚Äî what is sufficiently complete and what is sufficiently certain.</li>
<li>It is fact specific ‚Äî nature of agreement and circumstances in which agreement was made.</li>
<li>Judicial attitudes differ in their opinions as to the degree of certainty and completeness required, and the extent to which the courts should till gaps and resolve ambiguities.</li>
<li>Trend ‚Äî judges increasingly willing to fill gaps and resolve ambiguities (implied terms).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Certainty aspects
<ul>
<li>Sufficiently certain</li>
<li>Sufficiently complete</li>
<li>Promise must NOT Illusory
<ul>
<li>A promise is discretionary - don‚Äôt have to do it</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Completeness Overview
<ul>
<li>Parties must have reached agreement on all of its essential terms.
<ul>
<li>What is an essential term?
<ul>
<li>A term without which the contract cannot be enforced.</li>
<li>A term which only the parties can supply.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Whether an omission is fatal to contract formation depends on three main factors
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>How important or essential is the term that is missing?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Meaning of essentiality in this context: Milne v Attorney-General (Tas) (1956) 95 CLR 460</li>
<li>Whether the courts can fill the gaps by applying an objective or reasonable standard.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>Have the parties turned their mind to the issue?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Why has the term been left out? Was it deliberately left out or was it by mistake?</li>
<li>Agreements to agree are not enforceable. The court will generally not fill the gap in these circumstances.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="3">
<li>Has the agreement been partly executed?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>If one of the parties has already performed all or some of the contract, the courts are less likely to find that an agreement is incomplete (Foley v Classique).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Note: A mechanism or formula can be used to set an essential term, and this will not result in a contract being void for want of certainty.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sufficiently Complete: Essential Terms
<ul>
<li>For a contract to be sufficiently complete, parties must have reached agreement on all essential terms.</li>
<li>Consider: What is an essential term?
<ul>
<li>A term without which the contract cannot be enforced.</li>
<li>A term which only the parties can supply.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Milne v Attorney-General (Tas) (1956) 95 CLR 460 upholds this</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>HOW IMPORTANT / ESSENTIAL IS THE MISSING TERM?
<ul>
<li>The threshold question is whether the parties have specifically agreed on all the terms that only they can decide.</li>
<li>What matters is whether the court can enforce the contract in the absence of the term in question, without exceeding its role as the interpreter, rather than the author, of the contract.</li>
<li>If the parties have failed to agree on essential terms, the court will refuse to find an enforceable contract.</li>
<li>Depends on nature of the contract and circumstances of the case
<ul>
<li>The complexity of the contract and the courts understanding of and familiarity with the type of transaction.</li>
<li>The reason why the parties failed to reach agreement on the issue.</li>
<li>Whether the agreement remains wholly executory or has been wholly or partly</li>
<li>performed on one side.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Examples
<ul>
<li>Lease of land
<ul>
<li>Essential
<ul>
<li>The commencement date,</li>
<li>the rental to be paid,</li>
<li>parties,</li>
<li>subject matter (description of the land)</li>
<li>Without these terms, the agreement for a lease will not be binding</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sale of land
<ul>
<li>Essential
<ul>
<li>the parties,</li>
<li>description of the land</li>
<li>and the price</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Non-essential:
<ul>
<li>Settlement date ‚Äî the court can imply a reasonable settlement date</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sale of goods
<ul>
<li>Essential:
<ul>
<li>the parties</li>
<li>and description of the goods</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Non-essential:
<ul>
<li>a failure to stipulate the price may not be fatal (s.13 Goods Act (NSW))</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What if one party has already performed all or part of the contract?
<ul>
<li>The courts are less likely to find an agreement is incomplete if one party has already performed all or some of the contract.</li>
<li>See the case of Foley v Classique Coaches Ltd (1934) 2 KB 1, which illustrates the court‚Äôs effort to find certain y in a case where there has been some performance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Foley v Classique Coaches Ltd (1934) 2 KB 1
<ul>
<li>Foley and Classique Coaches entered into a written agreement on the 11th April 1930, whereby it was agreed that Foley would sell some of his land to Classique for lbs 1,100.00 (Land Agreement)</li>
<li>This Land Agreement was made subject to a condition that the parties would enter into another contract, the Petrol Supply Agreement on the same day, with the following terms:
<ul>
<li>Foley would sell petrol to Classique at price to be agreed in writing from time to time</li>
<li>The Petrol Agreement was to remain in force during Foley‚Äôs life and his wife‚Äôs</li>
<li>Classique would not buy petrol from anyone else</li>
<li>If any dispute arose regarding the subject matter or construction of the Petrol Supply Agreement, the dispute shall be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Act 1889 (UK)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In accordance with the two Agreements, the land was transferred to Classique and they bought petrol from Foley for 3 years. Then Classique wanted to purchase cheaper petrol elsewhere</li>
<li>Held
<ul>
<li>There was an effective and enforceable contract, although no definite price had been agreed with regard to the future supply of petrol</li>
<li>Key distinction here is that the land had been conveyed and the parties were well into performance of the agreement.
<ul>
<li>3 years into agreement</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>May and Butcher v The King (1934) 2 KB 17
<ul>
<li>May and Butcher entered into a 12 month contract with the Disposals and Liquidation Commission whereby it was agreed that the Commission would sell Old tentage to May and Butcher but the price would be ‚Äúagreed upon from time to time‚Äù (an agreement to agree).
<ul>
<li>The relationship soured and the Commission did not want to continue with the arrangement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>HELD:
<ul>
<li>The price was an essential term and the agreement was void for want of certainty;
<ul>
<li>the parties had agreed to reach agreement on the price in the future, so for the court to imply a reasonable price would be inconsistent with the expressed intentions of the parties, which was to set the price themselves,</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>However, an agreement to agree on an essential term may be enforceable if:
<ul>
<li>The agreement has been partly performed: Foley v Classique Coaches.</li>
<li>A mechanism / formula is specified to supply a term if the parties are unable to reach agreement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Completeness: A mechanism or formula can fill the gap
<ul>
<li>Effective mechanism
<ul>
<li>Parties may make a valid contract that defers agreement on an essential term by providing an effective mechanism for supplying the term in the event they fail to reach agreement.</li>
<li>See eg, the case of George v Roach (1942) 67 CLR 253:
<ul>
<li>George carried on the business of a newsagent and storekeeper.
<ul>
<li>He agreed to sell his business to Spencer.</li>
<li>The contract provided that a valuation of the newspaper agency would be provided by a third party, Mr Solomon, and this valuation would form the basis of the purchase price.</li>
<li>Spencer paid lbs 1,100 on account of the purchase price even though the valuation for not yet taken place.</li>
<li>Mr Solomon refused to undertake the valuation.</li>
<li>Mr Spencer had died by then but his wife, Roach (on behalf of his estate to recover the lbs 1,100 because the contract was void for uncertainty.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The High Court held that an agreement was ineffective when part of the purchase price was to be fixed by a nominated valuer who refused to carry out the task.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Effective formula
<ul>
<li>An alternative is for the parties to agree on a formula for settling an essential term in the event of a dispute
<ul>
<li>(eg: a base sum and a mathematical formula that incorporates reference to changes in the Consumer Price Index to determine increases in rent each year).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The validity of such a contract will then depend on whether the court regards the formula or standard as sufficiently certain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Certainty
<ul>
<li>The main purpose of interpreting terms of a contract is to work out what exactly each party has to do to meet the obligations under it. Interpretation is not always easy</li>
<li>Consider the agreements below:
<ul>
<li>Parties enter into an agreement to build a rear decking. They agree that the ‚Äú‚Ä¶timber used in the must be of high quality‚Äù</li>
<li>Parties enter into an agreement to ‚Äúsupply Coles with fresh eggs‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What do these terms mean?</li>
<li>Court‚Äôs approach to a particular term that is vague or imprecise
<ul>
<li>Not a pedantic test ‚Äî some ambiguity is acceptable:
<ul>
<li>Council of the Upper Hunter v Aust Chilling and Freezing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Whether an objective standard (where available) can be relied on or implied to save a clause. Courts are often divided as to this approach
<ul>
<li>Biotechnology v Pace (Note: this case also raises issues of illusory promises)</li>
<li>Whitlock v Brew</li>
<li>Hall v Busst</li>
<li>Meehan v Jones</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Uncertainty of meaning is more likely to affect validity if the parties have yet to perform</li>
<li>Agreements to negotiate in good faith are not necessarily too uncertain:
<ul>
<li>United Group Rail v Rail Corp</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Certainty of meaning
<ul>
<li>Court‚Äôs approach to a term that is vague or imprecise
<ul>
<li>The terms must not be vague and imprecise such that the courts cannot attribute sufficiently precise meaning to them.</li>
<li>Courts do not usually take a narrow approach to the requirement of certainty, and will attribute a meaning to the language used by the parties unless it is impossible to do so.</li>
<li>As with incompleteness, uncertainty is more likely to affect a contract that remains wholly executory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Council of the Upper Hunter County District v Australian Chilling &amp; Freezing (1968) 118 CLR 429
<ul>
<li>The Council contracted to sell electricity to Australian Chilling and Freezing (‚ÄúACF‚Äù)</li>
<li>Clause 5 of the agreement provided as follows:
<ul>
<li>It is agreed that during the term of this agreement if the supplier‚Äôs [Council‚Äôs] costs shall vary in other respects than has been hereinbefore provided the supplier [Council] shall have the right to vary the maximum demand charge and the energy charge by notice in writing to the purchaser [ACF]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The agreement also provided for arbitration in the event of a dispute between the parties</li>
<li>Council sought to increase their charges pursuant to clause 5</li>
<li>ACF argued that clause 5, in particular its reference to supplier‚Äôs costs varying, was uncertain and unenforceable</li>
<li>language employed by parties was not ‚Äúso obscure and so incapable of any definite or precise meaning that the court is unable to attribute to the parties any particular contractual intention‚Äù, the contract cannot be held to be uncertain to be void or meaningless</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implying Objective Standards
<ul>
<li>Standards of reasonableness and fairness (and similar concepts) are sometimes employed as terms of a contract expressly by the parties or implied by the courts to make a contract complete. Parties might use terms such as:
<ul>
<li>‚Äúa reasonable price for the goods‚Äù</li>
<li>‚Äúa fair and equitable price for her services‚Äù</li>
<li>‚Äúprice to be set at fair market value‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>These concepts are inherently imprecise but the question is whether they are uncertain.</li>
<li>The courts will endeavour to give those terms meaning in order to uphold a contract.</li>
<li>In some cases, what is reasonable or fair will not be sufficiently certain because it may be impossible to work out what it means.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Whitlock v Brew (1968) 118 CLR 445
<ul>
<li>What are the facts?
<ul>
<li>The difficulty that the court had to deal with was what does the term ‚Äúupon such reasonable terms as commonly govern a lease‚Äù in clause 5 actually mean?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Kitto J held:
<ul>
<li>The expression ‚Äòupon such reasonable terms as commonly govern a lease would have been sufficiently certain had there been an ascertainable set of terms in common use</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The result was that there was no consensus between the parties about key terms, such as the term of the lease, the rent</li>
<li>The arbitration clause would assist if there was a dispute as to what terms are reasonable and common to such a lease if such terms actually existed</li>
<li>The arbitration clause did not authorise an arbitrator to force on the purchaser such terms that the arbitrator might think are reasonable and ought commonly govern such a lease because to do so would alter the contract</li>
<li>Court concluded that clause 5 had no contractual effect, which resulted in the whole contract being rendered void</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hall v Busst (1960) 104 CLR 206
<ul>
<li>Hall and Busst agreed that Hall would purchase Busst‚Äôs land and chattels on an island, known as Bedarra Island for ¬£3.157</li>
<li>The agreement provided that:
<ul>
<li>Hall could not re-sell the land without first obtaining Busst‚Äôs consent</li>
<li>Such consent would be obtained by Hall giving notice to Busst of her intention to resell the land and Busst would have the option of repurchasing</li>
<li>Clause 5 stated: ‚Äúthe purchase price shall be the sum of ¬£3.157 4s 0d to which shall be added the value of all additions and improvements to the said property since the date of purchase‚Ä¶and from which shall be subtracted the value of the deficiencies in chattel property and a reasonable sum to cover depreciation of all buildings and property on the land.‚Äù</li>
<li>Hall sold the land and chattels to a third party for ¬£8,500 without giving notice to Busst</li>
<li>Busst sued Hall for breach of contract. Hall argued that the price clause in the option was void for uncertainty</li>
<li>The High Court held that the option was not enforceable because the price was uncertain</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>‚Äúthe value of all additions and improvements‚Äù is not sufficiently certain to give rise to an enforceable contract because there could be no external standard of value of additions and improvements to the island. There was nothing to compare it to, no external standard</li>
<li>‚ÄúThe value of all deficiencies‚Äù was uncertain in the ascertainment of the price
<ul>
<li>No external standard to assess what ‚Äúdepreciation of all other buildings and other property on the land‚Äù meant</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Certainty &amp; Agreements to negotiate
<ul>
<li>Contracts sometimes contain clauses as follows:
<ul>
<li>Parties must ‚Äònegotiate in good faith‚Äô the precise terms of a more comprehensive joint venture agreement</li>
<li>Parties must ‚Äòundertake genuine and good faith negotiations with a view to resolving disputes‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Such concepts such as ‚Äònegotiation‚Äô, ‚Äòmediation‚Äô and ‚Äògood faith‚Äô are inherently subjective, but the issue is whether they are enforceable
<ul>
<li>UK: these agreements cannot be legally binding on the basis that they are too uncertain to enforce</li>
<li>Australia: courts have been a bit more flexible and have tried to give such agreements some meaning, but it depends on the precise terms used. The Court looks for a promise that is sufficiently clear</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>United Group Rail Services Ltd v Rail Corporation NSW (2009) 74 NSWLR 618
<ul>
<li>
<p>United Group and Rail Corp entered into a contract whereby it was agreed that</p>
<ul>
<li>United Group would design and build new rolling stock for Rail Corp,.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clause 35 of the contract provided a dispute resolution clause.</p>
<ul>
<li>Part of the clause provided that if the dispute is referred to a senior representative of each party, they must meet and undertaken genuine and good faith negotiations with a view to resolving the dispute or difference.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>United Group argued that this clause was too uncertain and was therefore void and unenforceable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Held:</p>
<ul>
<li>The court held that their task is to give effect to business contracts where there is a meaning capable of being ascribed to a word or term or phrase.</li>
<li>Genuineness and good faith are not empty obligations.</li>
<li>Resolving a dispute ‚Äòrequires an honest and genuine attempt to resolve differences by discussion, and if thought to be reasonable and appropriate, by compromise, in the context of showing a faithfulness and fidelity to the existing bargain</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>ILLUSORY PROMISES &amp; CONSEQUENCES OF UNCERTAINTY
<ul>
<li>Certainty &amp; Illusory promises
<ul>
<li>A contract will be illusory if a party gives an unfettered discretion as to performance of a promise
<ul>
<li>What does unfettered mean?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the legal status of an illusory promise?
<ul>
<li>Placer Developments Ltd v Commonwealth (1969) 121 CLR 353</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A term will not be illusory where:
<ul>
<li>A party is given a latitude of choice which does not amount to complete and unfettered discretion
<ul>
<li>See Meehan v Jones (1982) 149 CLR 571</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The discretion relates to the fulfilment of a condition upon which the performance of the contract depends (ie there is no discretion as to the performance of the contract once the condition is satisfied)
<ul>
<li>See Meehan v Jones (1982) 149 CLR 571</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The discretion is exercised by a third party
<ul>
<li>Godecke v Kirwan (1973) 129 CLR 629</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Legal status of an illusory promise
<ul>
<li>Recognised general principle
<ul>
<li>Placer Developments Ltd v Commonwealth (1969) 121 CLR 353, 356 (Kitto J):
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòWherever words which by themselves constitute a promise are accompanied by words showing that the promisor is to have a discretion or option as to whether he will carry out that which purports to be the promise, the result is that there is no contract on which an action can be brought at all.‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are two ways of conceptualising this:
<ul>
<li>No consideration: an illusory promise is no promise at all (recall Australian Woollen Mills case).</li>
<li>Incomplete contract: an essential term has been left to be determined by one party.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Placer Developments Ltd v Commonwealth (1969) 121 CLR 353
<ul>
<li>Clause 14 of the Agreement stated that if customs duty had to be paid on the imported products and not remitted, ‚Äúthe Commonwealth will pay to the Timber Company a subsidy upon the exportation of these products from the Territory ‚Ä¶ of an amount or at a rate determined by the Commonwealth from time to time but the amount of subsidy paid shall not exceed the amount of customs duty paid and not remitted‚Äù</li>
<li>Kitto J held:
<ul>
<li>In this case (with specific reference to clause 14), the Commonwealth‚Äôs promise to pay an unspecified sum of money was illusory, since the Commonwealth was expressly given a discretion to determine the amount to be paid.</li>
<li>A promise to pay a governmental subsidy is meaningless in the absence of a specification of some amount or some basis of calculation.
<ul>
<li>That promise carries no implication that at least a reasonable subsidy shall be paid, for there is no general standard of reasonableness with respect to the quantum of a subsidy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A term will not be illusory where:
<ul>
<li>A party is given a latitude of choice, which does not amount to complete and unfettered discretion</li>
<li>The discretion relates to the fulfilment of a condition upon which the performance of the contract depends, so there is no discretion as to the performance of the contract once the condition is satisfied</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Meehan v Jones (1982) 149 CLR 571
<ul>
<li>The parties entered into a written agreement for the sale of land (an oil refinery) for a price of $800,000.00</li>
<li>The contract was subject to two conditions:
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Purchaser or his nominee entering into a satisfactory Agreement or arrangement with Ampol Petroleum Limited for the supply of a satisfactory quantity of crude oil</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>Purchaser or his nominee receiving approval for finance on satisfactory terms and conditions in an amount sufficient to complete the purchase hereunder;</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>and should either of the above conditions not be satisfied on or before 31 July 1979 (or such extended time as the</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>parties may agree upon) then this Contract (other than for the provisions of this Clause) shall be null and void</li>
<li>On 23 July, Jones sold the land to a 3rd party</li>
<li>On 30 July, Meehan advised Jones that both conditions had been satisfied. Meehan sought specific performance of the contract</li>
<li>The trial judge and the Full Court of the Supreme Court refused specific performance on the basis that the contract was void for uncertainty.
<ul>
<li>Meehan then appealed to the High Court</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CERTAINTY in Meehan v Jones
<ul>
<li>Where the words of a condition state that a contract is subject to finance, the question immediately arises whether the test to be applied is a subjective or objective.</li>
<li>In either case, the purchaser does not have absolute discretion.</li>
<li>The fact that opinions may differ as to which of these two meanings is given to the words of the clause does not mean that the clause is uncertain.</li>
<li>In considering whether the objective / subjective approach applied, the court said that unless a clause of this kind makes a clear indication to the contrary, its natural effect is to leave it to the:
<ul>
<li>purchaser to be [subjectively] satisfied, not some hypothetical reasonable man.</li>
<li>it may be implied that the purchaser will act honestly in deciding whether or not he is satisfied.</li>
<li>but it is not necessary to imply that the purchase will make reasonable efforts to obtain finance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ILLUSORY PROMISE in Meehan v Jones
<ul>
<li>Although there is nothing uncertain about a clause which speaks of [subjective] satisfaction of purchase, could it still be illusory?</li>
<li>There is a well settled principle that when ‚Äúthe promisor is to have a discretion or option as to whether he will carry out that which purports to, be the promise, the result is that there is no contract‚Äù</li>
<li>A contract is illusory where one of the parties has a discretion as to whether to perform the contract, but not where one of the parties has a discretion in relation to the fulfilment of a condition on which the contract depends.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Meehan v Jones (1982) (cont‚Äôd)
<ul>
<li>To say that a ‚Äúsubject to finance‚Äù or ‚Äúsubject to finance on satisfactory terms and conditions‚Äù clause denotes finance which is satisfactory to the purchaser is not to say that he has an absolute or unfettered right to decide what is satisfactory.</li>
<li>With some justification the vendor can claim that the agreement is a binding contract which relieves the purchaser from performance only in the event that, acting honestly, or honestly and reasonably, he is unable to obtain suitable finance.</li>
<li>There is in this formulation no element of uncertainty - the courts are quite capable of deciding whether the purchaser is acting honestly and reasonably.</li>
<li>Because the purchaser must act honestly, or honestly and reasonably, it is not a case where the purchaser has an unfettered discretion as to what constitutes finance on satisfactory terms
<ul>
<li>‚Äì the decision must be reached honestly, or honestly and reasonably.</li>
<li>Just because there is some discretion, does not make it unfettered</li>
<li>In this case, it is a condition, not a term</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Accordingly, the promise is not illusory</li>
</ul>

<li>The parties signed a document headed ‚ÄòOffer and Acceptance‚Äô setting out terms they agreed to for the sale and purchase of land. The agreement provided for a promise by the purchaser to execute, if required to do so, a further agreement in accordance with cl.6</li>
<li>Cl. 6 provided that if a formal agreement was required, it would be prepared by the vendor‚Äôs solicitors containing ‚Äúthe foregoing and such other covenants and conditions as they may reasonably require‚Äù</li>
<li>Kirwan refused to go ahead and transfer the land. He argued the agreement was illusory because they would be bound by the subsequent formal agreement drawn up by solicitors containing other terms and that conferred on them an unfettered discretion</li>
<li>Walsh J: the clause should be construed as limited to permitting the insertion of covenants and conditions not inconsistent with those contained in the offer. It was also limited by a standard of reasonableness, determined objectively so it did not confer an unfettered discretion on the solicitors</li>
<li>What did Gibbs J say?</li>

</li>
<li>Biotechnology Australia Pty Ltd v Pace (1988) 15 NSWLR 130 (Court of Appeal) - scheme one day‚Ä¶ somehow somewhere
<ul>
<li>Dr Pace was a scientist and he entered into an employment contract with a company called Biotechnology.</li>
<li>The contract provided that Dr Pace would receive a salary of $36,000 per annum, a company car and an option to participate in the Company‚Äôs senior staff equity sharing scheme.</li>
<li>Dr Pace was aware that at the time he accepted the offer of employment the Scheme didn‚Äôt exist but the company had plans to introduce it.
<ul>
<li>When his employment was terminated, he sued the company for damages for its failure to give him the option of participating in the equity sharing scheme.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Relevant issues before the Court:
<ul>
<li>Was the disputed clause so uncertain that it cannot be enforced?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Was the disputed clause so devoid of meaning and so dependent upon the initiatives and decision of Biotechnology Australia as to be illusory?</li>
<li>Kirby J - Uncertainty
<ul>
<li>Kirby J made some general observations about the task of courts in trying to resolve uncertainty in contracts.
<ul>
<li>Every case depends upon its own facts. The meaning of an agreement must be discovered objectively.
<ul>
<li>If there is ambiguity or vagueness, regard to extrinsic evidence might give meaning to the term</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Courts will try to uphold the agreements and avoid frustrating the wishes of the parties, but only so far as those wishes may be ascertained from the agreement between them</li>
<li>Courts will not uphold agreements where the court is asked to spell out to an unacceptable extent that which the parties have themselves failed to agree;
<ul>
<li>clarify that which is too obscure and accept for itself a discretion which the parties by their agreement reserved to one of both of them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Judges will differ in opinion about whether a court can give effect to an uncertain term and there is no objectively right decision in such cases.</li>
<li>The decisions are based on the features of the agreement, the relationship between the parties and relevant external reference points in order to resolve an uncertain term</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Application of legal principles to the facts
<ul>
<li>Was the disputed clause so uncertain of content that it could not be enforced?
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòIt was nonetheless void for uncertainty because the challenged term contained within it too many elements which are uncertain‚Ä¶the bare bones of the promise to establish such a scheme leave too mant decisions to be made for a court to attempt to give content to the promise by substituting its opinion of a fair scheme‚Ä¶</li>
<li>There are too many features of apparent peculiarity in which schemes ‚Ä¶
<ul>
<li>to make it safe to conclude that an objectively ascertainable external standard exists.‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The court found that there were too many elements which were uncertain such as:
<ul>
<li>How many shares in Biotech were to be devoted to the scheme?</li>
<li>What class of shares were to be held by the likes of Pace?</li>
<li>What were the terms of the options upon which the shares would issue?</li>
<li>What rights would attach to the shares?</li>
<li>Upon what terms were they acquired and could they be disposed of?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There were too many gaps to fill in which the parties themselves did not fill, and in this basis the term was unenforceable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Application of legal principles to the facts
<ul>
<li>Was the disputed clause so devoid of meaning and so dependent upon the initiatives and decisions of Biotechnology Australia as to be illusory?
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe problem for the court is that the term is just too uncertain of content.‚Äô</li>
<li>The ‚Äòfulfilment of the term relating to the equity sharing scheme depended upon the decision of one party, namely Biotechnology.</li>
<li>There was no external standard to fix an ‚Äúappropriate‚Äù or ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù equity participation scheme.‚Äô</li>
<li>The ‚Äòexistence of other schemes in other companies with other products and other scientists provides no such reference point‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Biotechnology Australia Pty Ltd v Pace (1988) 15 NSWLR 130 (Court of Appeal)
<ul>
<li>McHugh JA (applied similar reasoning to Kirby P):
<ul>
<li>The promise is too illusory or too vague and uncertain to be enforceable.</li>
<li>The parties recognised that Biotech would decide both the nature of the scheme and the rights of the individuals participating in it.</li>
<li>There is no standard by which a court could determine in any meaningful sense whether such a promise was broken.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hope JA (dissent):
<ul>
<li>Biotech was required to give Pace an option on terms which it had honestly arrived at.</li>
<li>The role of staff equity sharing schemes in employment contracts is sufficiently well established to enable courts to apply the concept of reasonableness to them.</li>
<li>The schemes are more complex than bonuses but that merely makes the resolution of the problem more difficult;
<ul>
<li>it does not deny the possibility of resolution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Concluded that the promise was valid - ‚Äô‚Ä¶ in my opinion the proper conclusion at this stage of the hearing is that as there was a valid and enforceable contractual promise on the part of Biotech to establish a senior staff equity sharing scheme and that the promise was not unenforceable for uncertainty or as being illusory‚Ä¶‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consequences of uncertainty
<ul>
<li>If the terms of an agreement are incomplete, uncertain or illusory, the consequences that can flow include:
<ul>
<li>The whole agreement is VOID
<ul>
<li>If the terms of an agreement are incomplete, uncertain or illusory, the courts look at how essential the term is and the intention of the parties in order to determine whether the entire agreement is void.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SEVERANCE ‚Äì the ineffective term can be severed from the rest of the agreement
<ul>
<li>The problematic term can be severed from the rest of the agreement, and the remaining terms are able to be performed and enforced.</li>
<li>The court will take into account the essentiality of the term and whether severing it is consistent with the intention of the parties.
<ul>
<li>If severing the clause changes the agreement into something the parties did not agree to, the court will not allow that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Eg: Whitlock v Brew: If the court had severed clause 5 of the contract, it would have turned the sale into something different from what the parties contemplated</li>

<li>‚ÄòI think Mr. Plant means he is selling ‚Äúthe twenty-four acres we have been looking at,‚Äù or ‚Äúmy twenty-four acres.‚Äù</li>
<li>It is not twenty-four acres of land anywhere in England, but the place, the county, and the parish are all mentioned. ‚Ä¶ Assuming that the parol evidence comes up to what has been stated, the result would be this: that Mr. Plant had twenty-four acres lying within the metes and bounds sufficiently defined; and if the fact be ascertained that he had no other twenty-four acres that would answer that description, then there would be simply the laying the contract alongside that fact, and the result will be ascertained ‚Äî namely, that the twenty-four acres lying within the metes and bounds was the property that was intended to be included in this description.‚Äô (Chitty J, 290)</li>

<li>The following is a simplified outline of this Act:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>(a) For the purposes of a law of this jurisdiction, a transaction is not invalid because it took place by means of one or more electronic communications.</li>
<li>(b) The following requirements imposed under a law of this jurisdiction can generally be met in electronic form:
<ul>
<li>i. a requirement to give information in writing,</li>
<li>ii. a requirement to provide a signature,</li>
<li>iii. a requirement to produce a document,</li>
<li>iv. a requirement to record information,</li>
<li>v. a requirement to retain a document.</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Section 9 ‚Äì Signatures
<ul>
<li>(1) If, under a law of this jurisdiction, the signature of a person is required, that requirement is taken to have been met in relation to an electronic communication if:
<ul>
<li>(a) a method is used to identify the person and to indicate the person‚Äôs intention in respect of the information communicated, and</li>
<li>(b) the method used was either:
<ul>
<li>(i) as reliable as appropriate for the purpose for which the electronic communication was generated or communicated, in the light of all the circumstances, including any relevant agreement, or</li>
<li>(ii) proven in fact to have fulfilled the functions described in paragraph (a), by itself or together with further evidence, and (c) the person to whom the signature is required to be given consents to that requirement being met by way of the use of the method mentioned in paragraph (a).

<li>Ecosse Property Holdings Pty Ltd v Gee Dee Nominees Pty Ltd (2017) 261 CLR 544
<ul>
<li>Westmelton wanted to sell land to Mr Morris.</li>
<li>Local planning laws prohibited the sale.</li>
<li>19 November 1988: Parties entered a 99-year lease to emulate a sale.</li>
<li>Mr Morris paid $70,000 lump-sum ‚Äòrental‚Äô on entry into the lease.</li>
<li>(ie, like paying a price to purchase the land.)</li>
<li>Based on a standard-form memo of a farm lease that had been adapted by the parties.</li>
<li>‚ÄòThe result is that the memorandum of agreement as executed is something of a pastiche.‚Äô</li>
<li>1993: Ecosse property purchased the land from Westmelton (becomes landlord).</li>
<li>2004: Mr Morris transfers tenancy to Gee Dee (becomes tenant).</li>
<li>Parties disputed scope of clause 4.</li>
<li>Ecosse‚Äôs submission: tenant liable for all rates, taxes, assessments and outgoings whatsoever in respect of the land, irrespective Of whether they were they were levied on the landlord or tenant.</li>
<li>Gee Dee‚Äôs submission: tenant liable for all rates, taxes, assessments and outgoings whatsoever in respect of the land levied only on the tenant.</li>
<li>Poorly drafted lease was ambiguous: surrounding circumstances could be considered.</li>
<li>How would a reasonable businessperson in the position of the parties have understood cl 4?</li>
<li>Poor drafting allowed departure from literal meanings to choose an interpretation that further the commercial objects of the agreement.</li>

<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe question is whether the effect of an exception clause in a contract is to absolve a party from liability for the consequences of a breach of duty, or whether its effect is to define substantively the limits of his duty by negativing obligations that the law would otherwise impose and undertakings that it would otherwise imply.

<li>Photo Production Ltd v Securicor Transport Ltd [1980] AC 827
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòMy Lords, the reports are full of cases in which what would appear to be very strained constructions have been placed upon exclusion clauses, mainly in what to-day would be called consumer contracts and contracts of adhesion.</li>
<li>As Lord Wilberforce has pointed out, any need for this kind of judicial distortion of the English language has been banished by Parliament‚Äôs having made these kinds of contracts subject to the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977.‚Äò851 (Lord Wilberforce)</li>

<li>‚ÄòIn commercial contracts negotiated between businessmen capable of looking after their own interests and of deciding how risks inherent in the performance of various kinds of contract can be most economically borne (generally by insurance), it is, in my view, wrong to place a strained construction upon words in an exclusion clause which are clear and fairly susceptible of one meaning only.‚Äô 851 (Lord Wilberforce)</li>

<p>DARLINGTON FUTURES LTD V DELCO AUSTRALIA PTY LTD (1986) 161 CLR 500</p>
<ul>
<li>Leading case on construction of exclusion clauses.</li>
<li>Facts
<ul>
<li>Delco retained Darlington to trade on the futures market on its behalf.</li>
<li>Written contract contained:</li>
<li>Exclusion clause</li>
<li>Limitation of liability clause.</li>
<li>Darlington five principles for exclusions
<ul>
<li>Natural and ordinary means</li>
<li>In light of the contract as a whole</li>
<li>Context of the market</li>
<li>Nature and object of the contract</li>
<li>Where appropriate use contra preferentum</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Clause 6 (Exclusion clause):</li>
<li>‚ÄòThe Client ‚Ä¶ acknowledges that the Agent will not be responsible for any loss arising in any way out of any trading activity undertaken on behalf of the Client whether pursuant to this Agreement or not</li>
<li>Clause 7(c) (Limitation clause):</li>
<li>‚ÄòAny liability on the Agent‚Äôs part ‚Ä¶ for damages for or in respect of any claim arising out of or in connection with the relationship established by this agreement or any conduct under it or any orders or instructions given to the Agent by the Client ‚Ä¶ shall not in any event (and whether or not such liability results from or involves negligence) exceed one hundred dollars.‚Äô</li>
<li>Delco authorised Darlington to enter ‚Äòday trading‚Äô transactions, that should have been ‚Äòclosed out‚Äô within 24-hour of entering them.</li>
<li>Darlington breached the contract by not closing out certain transactions within 24 hours.</li>
<li>Caused Delco loss of $280,000.</li>
<li>Darlington relied on Cl 6 and 7(c) to exclude/limit liability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Clause 6 (Exclusion clause) did not totally exclude liability.</li>
<li>‚ÄòThe Client ‚Ä¶ acknowledges that the Agent will not be responsible for any loss arising in any way out of any trading activity undertaken on behalf of the Client whether pursuant to this Agreement or not .</li>
<li>Clause 7(c) (Limitation clause) did limit liability.</li>
<li>‚ÄòAny liability on the Agent‚Äôs part ‚Ä¶ for damages for or in respect of any claim arising out of or in connection with the relationship established by this agreement or any conduct under it or any orders or instructions given to the Agent by the Client ‚Ä¶ shall not in any event (and whether or not such liability results from or involves negligence) exceed one hundred dollars.‚Äô</li>
<li>Interpretation
<ul>
<li>Natural and Ordinary Meaning: Both the sign and the ticket seem to exclude liability quite broadly. The wording covers damages, losses, or injuries and doesn‚Äôt limit the scope of incidents from which the car park seeks to exclude its liability.</li>
<li>Contra Proferentem: If any ambiguity were found in the clauses, the interpretation should not favor Lodge Carpark.</li>
<li>The court accepted that this clause effectively limited Darlington‚Äôs liability.
<ul>
<li>This meant that any potential damages payable by Darlington to Delco would be capped at <span class="katex"><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord">100</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">e</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">v</span><span class="mord mathnormal">e</span><span class="mord mathnormal">n</span><span class="mord mathnormal">t</span><span class="mord mathnormal">h</span><span class="mord mathnormal">o</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">ug</span><span class="mord mathnormal">h</span><span class="mord mathnormal">t</span><span class="mord mathnormal">h</span><span class="mord mathnormal">e</span><span class="mord mathnormal">a</span><span class="mord mathnormal">c</span><span class="mord mathnormal">t</span><span class="mord mathnormal">u</span><span class="mord mathnormal">a</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.01968em;">ll</span><span class="mord mathnormal">osss</span><span class="mord mathnormal">u</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.10764em;">ff</span><span class="mord mathnormal">ere</span><span class="mord mathnormal">d</span><span class="mord mathnormal">b</span><span class="mord mathnormal">yDe</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.01968em;">l</span><span class="mord mathnormal">co</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.02691em;">w</span><span class="mord mathnormal">a</span><span class="mord mathnormal">ss</span><span class="mord mathnormal">i</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">g</span><span class="mord mathnormal">ni</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.10764em;">f</span><span class="mord mathnormal">i</span><span class="mord mathnormal">c</span><span class="mord mathnormal">an</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.01968em;">tl</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">y</span><span class="mord mathnormal">m</span><span class="mord mathnormal">ore</span><span class="mopen">(</span></span></span></span>280,000).</li>

<li>Donoghue v Stevenson [19321 AC 562

<li>‚ÄòThe fact that there is a contractual relationship between the parties which may give rise to an action for breach of contract, does not exclude the co-existence of a right of action founded on negligence as between the same parties, independently of the contract, though arising out of the relationship in fact brought about by the contract.‚Äô 609 (Lord Macmillan)</li>

<ul>
<li>‚ÄòIf the happening of a stipulated event will always result in the defeat of the main object of the contract, there will be no scope for holding that that object requires the conclusion that the exempting clause is not applicable to that event.</li>
<li>But even in cases where the occurrence of the events stipulated in the exemption clause will not always defeat the main object of the contract, the nature of those events may nevertheless give rise to the inference that the clause was intended to apply to those events even when they occur in circumstances which defeat the main object of the contract.‚Äô 227</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>TL;DR</p>
<ul>
<li>Darlington is the leading modern authority on construing exclusion clauses.</li>
<li>Construe exclusion clauses using the ordinary principles of construction.</li>
<li>If the clause is ambiguous, then it may be construed contra proferentum.</li>
<li>Older cases are examples of how clauses may be read down, not binding rules.</li>
<li>A clearly drafted exclusion clause may be of wide scope.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implied terms</p>
<ul>
<li>INTRODUCTION
<ul>
<li>Implied terms are as valid as express terms:</li>
<li>Damages can be awarded for breach.</li>
<li>Right to terminate may be conferred if the implied term is a condition.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hart v MacDonald (1910) 10 CLR 417
<ul>
<li>an implication is as much a part of a contract as any term couched in express words.‚Äô (430, Isaacs J)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Courts cautiously find implied terms as they do not want to rewrite the contract.</li>
<li>Exception: Legislation may provide that it cannot be contracted out of.</li>
<li>Servcorp WA Pty Ltd v Perron Investments Pty Ltd (2016) 50 WAR 226
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe requirement that an alleged implied term not ‚Äòcontradict‚Äô any express term plainly includes a direct contradiction.</li>
<li>However, the requirement has a broader connotation.</li>
<li>For example, a term cannot be implied if it is apparent, on the face of the document, that the parties adverted to the point in question and either deliberately rejected it or deliberately refrained from dealing with it.‚Äô (257, Buss</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hart v MacDonald (1910) 10 CLR 417
<ul>
<li>‚Äò[An entire agreement clause] excludes what is extraneous to the written contract: but it does not in terms exclude implications arising on a fair construction of the agreement itself, and in the absence of definite exclusion, an implication is as much a part of a contract as any term couched in express words.‚Äô (430, Isaacs J)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the court will not find the implied term then there is a gap in the contract.
<ul>
<li>One party will likely wear the loss / inconvenience.</li>
<li>Contract may fail:
<ul>
<li>Uncertain / incomplete</li>
<li>Frustrated.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>NATURE
<ul>
<li>Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of NSW(1982) 149 CLR 337</li>
<li>with implication the term is one which it is presumed that the parties would have agreed upon had they turned their minds to it ‚Äî it is not a term that they have actually agreed upon.‚Äô 346 (Mason J)</li>
<li>Finding implied terms risks making a court an author.</li>
<li>The court mitigates this risk by:
<ul>
<li>Viewing implication of terms as part of the process of construction (ie, discerning the parties‚Äô intentions from express terms.)</li>
<li>Imposing high barriers to the implication of terms.</li>

<li>Plaintiff shipowner moored at a jetty of defendant wharf-owner.</li>
<li>Both parties knew that the ship would rest on Thames riverbed at low tide.
<ul>
<li>Ship was damaged when it rested on hard ridge in the riverbed.</li>
<li>Plaintiff argued that there was an implied term that the ship could safely moor at the jetty at low tide.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Both parties knew that the ship would rest on the riverbed at low tide.</li>
<li>It was obvious that no shipowner would moor at an unsafe jetty.
<ul>
<li>Only the defendants could discover whether the riverbed was safe and take steps to make it safe.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Therefore, they impliedly promised either that:
<ul>
<li>It was safe to moor at the jetty; or</li>
<li>That they would warn the plaintiff if it was not safe.</li>

<ul>
<li>BP (Westernport) entered a rate agreement with the Shire of Hastings for the construction and operation of a refinery in the local government area.</li>
<li>The agreement required significant capital investment by BP (Westernport) and performance of obligations for at least 20 years.

<ul>
<li>Shirlaw v Southern Foundries (1926) Ltd [1939] 2 KB 206
<ul>
<li>Prima facie that which in any contract is left to be implied and need not be expressed is something so obvious that it goes without saying;
<ul>
<li>so that, if while the parties were making their bargain, an officious bystander were to suggest some express provision for it in the agreement, they would testily suppress him with a common, ‚ÄòOh, of course‚Äô.‚Äô 227 (MacKinnon LJ)</li>

<li>Servcorp WA Pty Ltd v Perron Investments Pty Ltd (2016) 50 WAR 226
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe requirement that an alleged implied term be capable of clear expression overlaps with the requirement of obviousness.</li>

<p>Terms implied in fact: Formal and informal contracts</p>
<ul>
<li>FORMAL CONTRACTS
<ul>
<li>Detailed written agreements that appear exhaustive.</li>

<li>BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings (1977) 180 CLR 266
<ul>
<li>for a term to be implied, the following conditions (which may overlap) must be satisfied (BP Refinery Test loosley):</li>
<li>Implied term interpretation construction loosley:</li>
<li>Formal term interpretation construction strictly:
<ul>
<li>(1) it must be reasonable and equitable;</li>
<li>(2) it must be necessary to give business efficacy (got to make it work) to the contract, so that no term will be implied if the contract is effective without it;</li>
<li>(3) it must be so obvious that ‚Äúit goes without saying‚Äù;</li>
<li>(4) it must be capable of clear expression;</li>
<li>(5) it must not contradict any express term of the contract.‚Äô 282-3 (Lord Simon of Glaisdale for the majority)</li>

<li>Hawkins v Clayton (1988) 164 CLR 539
<ul>
<li>(Subject to Realestate.com.au Pty Ltd v Hardingham [2022] HCA 39.)</li>
<li>January 1970: Ms Brasier executed a will appointing Mr Hawkins as executor and residual beneficiary.</li>
<li>Ms Brasier‚Äôs solicitor was Clayton Utz.
<ul>
<li>January 1975: Ms Brasier died.</li>
<li>Clayton Utz didn‚Äôt attempt to find Mr Hawkins until March 1981.</li>
<li>House had degraded and estate was fined for late lodgement of death duty.</li>
<li>Therefore the value of residuary estate was reduced.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mr Hawkins (for the Estate) argued that Clayton Utz had breached an implied term of Ms Brasier‚Äôs retainer contract with the firm imposing a duty to take reasonable care and locate the executor after her death.</li>
<li>Terms inferred based on ‚Äòactual‚Äô intention:
<ul>
<li>Will would be kept safe until Ms Brasier‚Äôs death.</li>
<li>Ms Brasier could request it be delivered to her at any time before her death.</li>

<ul>
<li>Hardingham: Sub-licence granted by REMA to the agencies permitted them to use the works only to market the relevant properties.</li>
<li>Therefore, Realestate and RP had breached copyright by continuing to use the works.</li>
<li>Contracts between REMA and the agencies were informal oral contracts.</li>
<li>No express terms on the scope of the sub-licence.</li>
<li>Was the limit on the sub-licences an implied term of these contracts?</li>
<li>REMA aware that:
<ul>
<li>The agencies needed to upload the Works to Realestate.com.au to properly market the properties.</li>
<li>Realestate.com.au required a licence be granted to use the Works as it saw fit, including sub-licencing the works to third parties.</li>

<p>TERMS IMPLIED BY TRADE CUSTOM</p>
<ul>
<li>Con-Stan Industries of Australia Pty Ltd v Norwich Winterthur Insurance (Australia) Ltd (1986) 160 CLR 226
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThere must be evidence that the custom relied on is so well known and acquiesced in that everyone making a contract in that situation can reasonably be presumed to have imported that term into the contract.‚Äô (236, The Court)</li>
<li>Con-Stan entered an insurance contract with Norwich.
<ul>
<li>Con-Stan paid premiums to a third-party broker operating on behalf of Norwich, which were never passed onto Norwich.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Norwich sued Con-Stan for the unreceived premiums.
<ul>
<li>Con-Stan argued that the insurance contract contained a term implied by trade custom that an insurer could only claim remiums from the broker.</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Topic 4.3 Terms implied by law (Not assessed)
<ul>
<li>The final basis for implication of terms is when the law itself implies terms into certain classes of contract. The law can imply terms in two ways
<ul>
<li>First, the common law can imply terms, provided that the implied terms are not inconsistent with the express terms.</li>
<li>Second - and perhaps more commonly these days - legislation can imply terms into contract. Terms implied by legislation often cannot be contracted out of.</li>
<li>doThird, and perhaps most commonly, they can be implied based upon the presumed intention of the parties as evidenced in the express terms.</li>

<li>Discharge, termination of contract
<ul>
<li>A contract may be ended in 3 ways:
<ul>
<li>Discharged by full performance</li>
<li>Terminated before full performance</li>
<li>By agreement</li>
<li>Because of breach or repudiation</li>
<li>Frustrated</li>
<li>Consent vitiated</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The contract is ‚Äòterminated‚Äô when:
<ul>
<li>Termination by agreement</li>
<li>Termination because of breach or repudiation</li>
<li>Termination by frustration</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Legal effect: parties are released</li>

<ul>
<li>the contract is not rescinded as from the beginning.</li>
<li>This case is significant in Australian contract law regarding the right to terminate a contract for repudiation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>RESCISSION
<ul>
<li>The contract is ‚Äòrescinded‚Äô when a party whose consent was impaired elects to void the contract.</li>
<li>Rescinding the contract voids everything done under the contract.</li>
<li>Parties must be restored to their pre-contractual positions.</li>

</li>
<li>DISCHARGE BY PERFORMANCE
<ul>
<li>Most contracts are discharged by being performed.</li>
<li>Full performance does not make the contract disappear.</li>
<li>Secondary terms can continue to bind the parties. Eg, confidentiality clauses, dispute resolution clauses, etc.</li>
<li>To assess whether a contract is performed, it must be construed to determine:
<ul>
<li>What parties are obliged to do.</li>
<li>When those obligations must be performed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tendered performance is then measured against that proper construction.</li>

<li>INTRODUCTION TO TERMINATION BY AGREEMENT
<ul>
<li>Printing and Numerical Registering Co v Sampson (1875) LR 19 Eq 462</li>
<li>INTRODUCTION
<ul>
<li>Termination by agreement rests on mutual consent.</li>
<li>Termination for breach/repudiation: unilateral act of one party in response to failure to perform by the other.</li>
<li>Frustration: automatic termination by the law in response to a frustrating event.</li>
<li>Termination by agreement can be achieved by:
<ul>
<li>Power granted by a term in the contract.</li>
<li>Expressly or impliedly agreeing to end a contract by entering into another contract.</li>
<li>A contract may also be varied by entering a further agreement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>TERMINATION BY CONTRACTUAL TERM
<ul>
<li>EXPRESS POWER
<ul>
<li>Parties can agree to terms conferring a power to terminate.
<ul>
<li>At will: Contract is immediately terminable at any time.</li>
<li>With notice: A party provides notice and the contract expires after the agreed notice period. (Eg, employment contracts)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CONTINGENT CONDITIONS
<ul>
<li>Terms that either automatically terminate ‚Äî or give the parties the right to terminate ‚Äî if an identified event does / does not occur.</li>
<li>New Zealand Shipping Co Ltd v Soci√©t√© des Ateliers et Chantiers de France [1919] AC 1
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòIt is undoubtedly competent for the two parties to a contract to stipulate by a clause in it that the contract shall be void upon the happening of an event over which neither of the parties shall have any control, cannot bring about, prevent or retard.</li>
<li>For instance, they may stipulate that if rain should fall on the thirtieth day after the date of the contract, the contract should be void.</li>
<li>Then if rain did fall on that day the contract would be put to an end by this event, whether the parties so desire or not.‚Äô (9, Lord Atkinson)</li>

<li>Seen as a sub-class or inessential terms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If a promisor breaches an intermediate term, then the promisee may terminate the contract only if the breach is serious.</li>

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<ul>
<li>BREACH
<ul>
<li>Breach = Failure to properly perform when required.</li>
<li>‚ÄòActual‚Äô breach requires:</li>
<li>Identification of relevant express or implied term(s) imposing obligation(s).</li>
<li>Construction of relevant term(s) to determine what is required.</li>
<li>Failure to properly perform when required.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>TOTAL / PARTIAL BREACH
<ul>
<li>Not necessary to classify a breach as ‚Äòtotal‚Äô or ‚Äòpartial‚Äô.</li>
<li>Relevant issue is whether it a term is breached at all.</li>
<li>Consequences of breach may be relevant if the term is classed as ‚Äòintermediate‚Äô.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>ANTICIPATORY BREACH</p>
<ul>
<li>Where a party by words or conduct indicates either:
<ul>
<li>an intention not to perform or</li>
<li>a complete incapacity to perform</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>a promise before that performance falls due.</li>
<li>Foran v Wight (1989) 168 CLR 385
<ul>
<li>‚Äô‚Ä¶ an announcement by the promisor before the time for performance arrives that he will not perform the promise is an anticipatory breach ‚Ä¶ .‚Äô 416 (Brennan J)</li>

<li>
<p>TRIPARTITE CLASSIFICATION OF TERMS</p>
<ul>
<li>Conditions definition
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòEssential‚Äô terms</li>
<li>Any breach allows termination</li>
<li>Damages available</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Intermediate definition
<ul>
<li>Serious breach allows termination</li>
<li>No termination for trivial breach</li>
<li>Damages available</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Warranty definition
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòInessential‚Äô terms</li>
<li>No termination for breach</li>
<li>Damages available</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A terminable breach does not automatically terminate the contract.</li>
<li>Innocent party may choose to:</li>
<li>Terminate; or</li>
<li>Affirm the contract.</li>
<li>Process of choosing = ‚Äòelection‚Äô.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Principal points to note</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether an innocent party has a right to terminate depends upon the classification of the term.</li>
<li>If they have the right, then they may choose to terminate or affirm (See: Election)</li>
<li>Other remedies (like damages) may be cumulative with the right to terminate</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>MODIFYING THE COMMON LAW RIGHT TO TERMINATE</p>
<ul>
<li>Parties may agree to modify the common law rights to terminate for breach.
<ul>
<li>For example:</li>
<li>Allow termination for any breach of any type of term.</li>
<li>Impose a procedure on how to terminate.</li>

<ul>
<li>TEST OF ESSENTIALITY
<ul>
<li>‚ÄùThe test of essentiality is whether it appears from the general nature of the contract considered as a whole, or from some particular term or terms, that the promise is of such importance to the promisee that he would not have entered into the contract unless he had been assured of a strict ‚Ä¶ performance of the promise ‚Ä¶ and that this ought to have been apparent to the promisor.‚Äô 641-2</li>

<ul>
<li>Tramways promised to display boards on trams advertising Luna Park.</li>
<li>‚ÄòWe guarantee that these boards will be on the tracks at least eight hours per day throughout your season.‚Äô</li>
<li>Tramways displayed the boards for an average of 8 hours a day over the season.</li>
<li>NSW District Court: Tramways breached the term by not displaying all boards for a minimum of 8 hours a day, every day.</li>
<li>High Court: Was the term a condition?</li>
<li>The term was a condition:</li>
<li>Strong language: ‚Äòwe guarantee ‚Ä¶‚Äô</li>
<li>Luna Park obligated to pay only after Tramways had provided the service.</li>

<li>Bancks terminated the contract for Associated‚Äôs breach.</li>
<li>Was the term a condition?</li>
<li>The term was a condition:
<ul>
<li>The parties‚Äô mutual promises were ‚Äòconcurrent and corelative‚Äô. ie. the principal reasons why both parties entered the contract.</li>

</ul>
</li>

</li>
<li>ANTICIPATORY BREACH
<ul>
<li>Where a party by words or conduct indicates either:
<ul>
<li>an intention not to perform or</li>
<li>a complete incapacity to perform</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A promise before that performance falls due.</li>
<li>Foran v Wight (1989) 168 CLR 385
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòWhen a promise is an essential term of a contract, an announcement by the promisor before the time for performance arrives that he will not perform the promise is an anticipatory breach amounting to a repudiation of the contract conferring on the promisee a right to [terminate] the contract.‚Äô (416, Brennan J)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Allows a party to terminate immediately on notice that an essential promise will not be performed ‚Äì Innocent party does not have to wait until breach has occurred.</li>
<li>Or innocent party can choose to wait and see.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>TWO FORMS
<ul>
<li>Express anticipatory breach</li>
<li>Implied anticipatory breach</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>EXPRESS ANTICIPATORY BREACH
<ul>
<li>Foran v Wight (1989) 168 CLR 385
<ul>
<li>The Wights agreed to sell land to the Forans.</li>
<li>Date of settlement was an essential term.</li>
<li>Wights telephoned 2 days before settlement to advise that they would not be able to settle.</li>
<li>Neither party attempted settlement.</li>
<li>Forans terminated the contract 2 days after settlement date.</li>
<li>The breach was then anticipatory because it amounted to a refusal by the vendors to perform an essential term of the contract before the time for performance had arrived.‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>IMPLIED ANTICIPATORY BREACH
<ul>
<li>Where the defaulting party‚Äôs conduct or other circumstances make it clear to the innocent party that the defaulting party will not perform an essential obligation when it is due.</li>
<li>Also known as factual inability or factual impossibility.</li>
<li>Universal Cargo Carriers Corp v Citati [1957] 2 QB 401
<ul>
<li>Universal agree to transport Citati‚Äôs cargo from Basrah to Buenos Aires.</li>
<li>Citati did not have cargo available for loading 3 days before Universal‚Äôs ship was due to depart.</li>
<li>Universal departed ‚Äì argued that Citati had impliedly committed an anticipatory breach because cargo was not available with enough time to load.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An anticipatory breach must be proved in fact and not in supposition.‚Äô
<ul>
<li>if Mr. Roskill can produce out of the award a finding, that on July 18 the charterer was unable to load a cargo within such a time as would not have frustrated the object of the venture, the owners would be entitled to succeed.‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>IMPLIED ANTICIPATORY BREACH
<ul>
<li>Terminating because of an implied anticipatory breach is risky because the innocent party must prove the factual impossibility.
<ul>
<li>If the anticipatory breach is express, the innocent party may act on the express statement without more.</li>

</li>
<li>SUMMARY
<ul>
<li>Shevill v Builders Licensing Board (1982) 146 CLR 620
<ul>
<li>‚Äò[A valid contract] may be repudiated if one party renounces his liabilities under it ‚Äì if he evinces an intention no longer to be bound by the contract ‚Ä¶ or shows that he intends to fullfil the contract only in a manner substantially inconsistent with his obligations and not in any other way ‚Ä¶ . In such a case the innocent party is entitled to accept the repudiation, thereby discharging himself from further performance, and sue for damages.‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Repudiation def
<ul>
<li>Repudiation of a contract occurs when one party to the contract demonstrates that it is unwilling or unable to fulfill its obligations under that contract.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Repudiation test
<ul>
<li>The test is whether the party‚Äôs conduct would convey to a reasonable person, in the position of the other contracting party, renunciation of the contract as a whole (ie. an unwillingness or inability to perform all of that party‚Äôs obligations) or of a fundamental obligation under it.
<ul>
<li>A sufficiently serious failure to perform obligations that are not fundamental may also show an unwillingness or an inability to substantially perform the contract according to its requirements (Koompahtoo).</li>

<li>Topic 5.5 Discharge by frustration
<ul>
<li>DEFINITION
<ul>
<li>National Carriers Ltd v Panalpina (Northern) Ltd [1981] AC 675
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòFrustration of a contract takes place when there supervenes an event (without default of either party) and for which the contract makes no sufficient provision) which so significantly changes the nature (not merely the expense or onerousness) of the outstanding contractual rights and/or obligations from what the parties could reasonably have contemplated</li>
<li>The law declares both parties to be discharged from further performance.‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>

</li>
<li>NATURE OF CONTRACTUAL PROMISES
<ul>
<li>Paradine v Jane (1646) Aleyn 26
<ul>
<li>when the party by his own contract creates a duty or charge upon himself, he is bound to make it good, if he may, notwithstanding any accident by inevitable necessity, because he might have provided against it by his contract.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>‚ÄòAbsolute contract‚Äô rule.</li>
<li>To avoid liability for failure to perform:
<ul>
<li>Do not make absolute promises.</li>
<li>Include an exclusion clause.</li>
<li>Include a force majeure clause.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Taylor v Caldwell (1863) 122 ER 309
<ul>
<li>where, from the nature of the contract, it appears that the parties must from the beginning have known that it could not be fulfilled unless when the time for the fulfilment of the contract arrived some particular specified thing continued to exist, so that, when entering into the contract, they must have contemplated such continuing existence as the foundation of what was to be done</li>

</li>
<li>ROLE OF THE CONTRACT
<ul>
<li>Davis Contractors Ltd v Fareham Urban District Council [1956] AC 696
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe question is whether the contract which they did make is, on its true construction, wide enough to apply to the new situation: if it is not, then it is at an end.‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Relevant questions:
<ul>
<li>What was the purpose/foundation of the contract?</li>
<li>What did the parties promise to do?</li>
<li>Does the contract account for the supervening event?</li>
<li>What was the impact of the supervening event on the contract?</li>

<li>Relevant question: what is the effect of the supervening event?</li>
<li>The supervening event must radically impact performance for both parties.</li>

<li>Completion within 130 weeks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Legal advice said that working could not be restricted.</li>
<li>Residents obtained injunctions limiting Codelfa‚Äôs daily work hours.</li>
<li>Codelfa argued that the injunctions frustrated the contract.</li>
<li>‚ÄòThe critical issue then is whether the situation resulting from the grant of the injunction is fundamentally different from the situation contemplated by the contract on its true construction in the light of the surrounding circumstances.‚Äô (360, Mason J (Stephen J agreeing)).</li>
<li>‚ÄòThe answer must, I think, be in the affirmative. ‚Ä¶</li>
<li>Performance by means of a two shift operation, necessitated by the grant of the injunctions, was fundamentally different from that contemplated by the contract.‚Äô (363, Mason J (Stephen J agreeing)).</li>

<li>Penrith District Rugby League Football Club Limited v Fittler [1996] NSWSC 523
<ul>
<li>In my judgment, it would be grossly inequitable if a party could shelter behind the fact that it had brought about the frustrating event in order to avoid what would otherwise have been the consequences of such frustration, namely discharge of the contract at the behest of the other party.</li>
<li>There is English authority that such an inequitable outcome is not the result.</li>
<li>Rather, the innocent party may rely upon the circumstances brought about by the other party to the contract as giving rise to frustration.‚Äô (Santow J)</li>

</li>
<li>[74] In the case of foreseeable but unforeseen events, the nature and extent of foreseeability is critical.

<li>Smith v Hughes (1871) LR 6 QB 597
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe general rule, both of law and equity, in respect to concealment, is that mere silence with regard to a material fact, which there is no legal obligation to divulge, will not avoid a contract, although it operate as an injury to the party from whom it is concealed.</li>

<ul>
<li>The purchaser, therefore, would be led to suppose, as to these farms, that he was purchasing with continuing tenancies at fixed rents, whereas he would, in fact, have to find tenants immediately after the completion of his purchase.‚Äô (Sir GJ Turner LJ)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Changed circumstances
<ul>
<li>A representation that is true at the time it is made, but which becomes untrue by the time the contract is formed, is a misrepresentation.</li>
<li>Eg: a statement of fact which becomes false; a statement of intent to do something which changes.</li>
<li>If the defendant becomes aware that the representation has become untrue before the contract is formed they must inform the plaintiff.</li>
<li>The law allows a plaintiff to assume that representations made by a defendant are true up until the contract is formed.</li>

</ol>
</li>
<li>

<li>If a material representation is made which is calculated to induce the plaintiff to enter into a contract and that person in fact enters into a contract there arises a fair inference of fact that he or she was induced to do so by the representation.</li>

<ol start="3">
<li>The inference may be rebutted, for example, by showing that the plaintiff, before he or she entered into the contract, either was possessed of actual knowledge or the true facts and knew them to be true or alternatively made it plain that whether, he or she knew the true facts or not, he or she did not rely on the representation.</li>

<li>Concrete Constructions (NSW) Pty Ltd v Nelson (1990) 169 CLR 594
<ul>
<li>the conduct of a corporation towards persons‚Ä¶ with whomit it‚Ä¶ has or may have dealings in the course of those activities or transactions which, of their nature, bear a trading or commercial character.‚Äô</li>
<li>As a matter of language, a prohibition against engaging
<ul>
<li>in conduct ‚Äúin trade or commerce‚Äù can be construed as encompassing conduct in the course of the myriad of activities which are not, of their nature, of a trading or commercial character but which are undertaken in the course of, or as incidental to, the carrying on of an overall trading or commercial business.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>‚Äô ‚Ä¶it is plain that [s 18] was not intended to extend to all conduct, regardless of its nature, in which a corporation might engage inthe course of, or for the purposes of, its overall trading or commercial business.
<ul>
<li>activities or transactions which, of their nature, bear a trading or commercial character.</li>
<li>An internal communication by one employee to another employee in the course of their ordinary activities in and about the construction of a building.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Such conduct includes, of course, promotional activities in relation to, or for the purposes of, the supply of goods or services to actual or potential consumers, be they identified persons or merely an unidentifiable section of the public.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hearn v O‚ÄôRourke (2003) 129 FCR 63
<ul>
<li>[28] The following propositions emerge from the above extract [from Nelson]:
<ul>
<li>The phrase ‚Äúin trade or commerce‚Äù has a restrictive operation, in the sense that it narrows the operation of [s 18].</li>
<li>The phrase is capable of both a wider and a narrower interpretation.</li>
<li>The wider interpretation would include ‚Äù‚Ä¶ the myriad of activities which are not, of their nature, of a trading or commercial character but which are undertaken in the course of, or as incidental to, the carrying on of an overall trading or commercial business.‚Äù</li>
<li>Such an approach would impose an overlay of Commonwealth law upon any area in which a corporation might act in carrying on its trading or commercial activities. ‚Ä¶</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The second, and narrower construction is that [s 18] applies only to conduct ‚Äù‚Ä¶ which is itself an aspect or element of activities or transactions which, of their nature, bear a trading or commercial character.‚Äù
<ul>
<li>The narrower construction is correct.</li>
<li>The section is concerned with the conduct of a corporation towards persons with whom it has, or may have dealings in the course of its trading activities or transactions which dealings, of their nature, bear a trading or commercial character.</li>
<li>The dividing line between conduct which is in trade or commerce and conduct which is not may be unclear, in which case it may be necessary to identify the features which import a trading or commercial character to an activity which would not, without more, have that character.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The mere driving of a truck or construction of a building is not, without more, in trade or commerce.</li>
<li>To engage in conduct which is divorced from any relevant actual or potential trading or commercial relationship or dealing will not, of itself, constitute conduct ‚Äúin trade or commerce‚Äù for the purposes of the section. (Dowsett J)
<ul>
<li>The focus must be upon the conduct in question and not upon the range of activities in which a relevant corporation may be engaged.</li>
<li>In other words, one does not simply identify the conduct in question, note that the relevant corporation is engaged in commercial activity of some kind, then look for a connection between the two.
<ul>
<li>Because corporations are usually formed to engage in commercial activities, it will rarely be difficult to find such a connection.</li>
<li>The correct approach is to determine whether or not the relevant conduct can, according to ordinary usage, be described as having occurred in the course of dealings ‚Äú‚Ä¶which, of their nature, bear a trading or commercial character‚Äù.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ultimately a question of fact.</li>
<li>Note: only the defendant needs to be acting in trade or commerce: not the plaintiff.</li>
<li>Lubidineuse v Bevanere Pty Ltd (1984) 3 FCR 1
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòIn determining whether, in a particular case, that test is met it is relevant to consider inter alia the character of the parties involved ‚Äì which I assume to include whether they are people who have engaged, or are about to engage, in commercial activities ‚Äì whether the transaction is motivated by business, as distinct from personal, reasons and whether the person whose conduct is under attack played an active part in the transaction.‚Äô (12, Wilcox J)</li>

<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe sale of the clinic should not be viewed in isolation from the totality of the appellant‚Äôs commercial activities</li>
<li>The mere fact that it was the sale of a capital asset did not deprive it of its character as a transaction in trade or commerce.‚Äô</li>
<li>But that is not to say that a corporation must engage in multiple transactions of a similar kind for it to be engaged in trade or commerce</li>
<li>In our opinion, the making of the arrangements necessary to dispose of the clinic were part and parcel of the totality of the appellant‚Äôs activities in trade or commerce.‚Äô</li>

<li>while in most cases, the focus would be on the nature of the business of the party making the representation, [s 18] was not so limited;

<li>MISLEADING OR DECEPTIVE‚Äô
<ul>
<li>In dealings between identified individuals, the court will look at all the circumstances of the case:</li>
<li>The nature of the parties (Sophisticated business people dealing at arm‚Äôs length?</li>
<li>A consumer dealing with a corporation? Age, education, experience, etc)</li>
<li>The nature of the transaction (Sale of valuable property? Provision of a highly technical service? Purchase of a toilet brush?)</li>
<li>What was said/communicated in writing and how it was communicated.</li>

<li>Choo v Zhang [2016] NSWCA 193 (5 August 2016)
<ul>
<li>But in a case where the impugned conduct is said to consist of representations, the question of whether the conduct was misleading or deceptive ordinarily must be determined by what a reasonable person in the position of the representee would have made of the representations, taking into account all relevant circumstances</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>OPINIONS / STATEMENT OF FUTURE MATTER
<ul>
<li>Common law reasoning can apply.</li>
<li>ie, it can be misleading or deceptive if a defendant gives an opinion or makes a statement of future action when:</li>
<li>They do not honestly believe the statement; or</li>
<li>Do not have reasonable grounds for making the statement</li>
<li>Campbell v Backoffice Investments Pty Ltd (2009) 238 CLR 304
<ul>
<li>Opinions may carry with them one or more implied representations according to the circumstances of the case.
<ul>
<li>There will ordinarily be an implied representation that the person offering the opinion actually holds it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other implied representations may be that the opinion is based upon reasonable grounds, which may include the representation that it was formed on the basis of reasonable enquiries.</li>

<li>STATEMENT OF FUTURE MATTER
<ul>
<li>Wheeler Grace and Pierucci Pty Ltd v Wright (1989) ATPR ¬∂40-940
<ul>
<li>Employee induced Wrights into investing in mining operation with a clear, unqualified promise that they would receive a certain return.</li>
<li>Wrights argued that employee impliedly represented that he had reasonable grounds for the promise when he made it, which he did not.</li>
<li>The implied representation was misleading or deceptive conduct.
<ul>
<li>The fact that the corporation believed or had reasonable grounds for belief that the prediction would be fulfilled, would not answer the question as to whether the conduct was misleading or deceptive conduct in trade or commerce.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Honest belief in and reasonable grounds for saying that something will occur may not prevent the statement being misleading or deceptive.
<ul>
<li>For example, if the context requires that the statement be qualified to acknowledge risk.</li>

</li>
<li>OPINIONS
<ul>
<li>Forrest v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (2012) 247 CLR 486
<ul>
<li>Forrest told an audience of sophisticated investors that Fortescue Metals Group had a ‚Äòbinding contract‚Äô with a Chinese company.</li>
<li>Fortescue had not signed a legally binding contract.</li>
<li>Anticipating an ‚Äòopinion‚Äô argument, ASIC argued that Forrest impliedly misrepresented that he had a reasonable ground for making the statement.</li>
<li>It is ultimately unprofitable to attempt to classify the statement according to some taxonomy, no matter whether that taxonomy adopts as its relevant classes fact and opinion, fact and law, or some mixture of these classes.
<ul>
<li>It is necessary instead to examine more closely and identify more precisely what it is that the impugned statements conveyed to their audience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The common law approach may be used, but not necessary.
<ul>
<li>Only question: would a reasonable person be misled or deceived by the defendant‚Äôs conduct?</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>STATEMENT OF FUTURE MATTER</li>
<li>Australian Consumer Law Section 4 ‚Äì Misleading representations with respect to future matters
<ul>
<li>(1) If:
<ul>
<li>(a) a person makes a representation with respect to any future matter (including the doing of, or the refusing to do, any act); and</li>
<li>(b) the person does not have reasonable grounds for making the representation;
<ul>
<li>the representation is taken, for the purposes of this Schedule, to be misleading.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(2) For the purposes of applying subsection (1) in relation to a proceeding concerning a representation made with respect to a future matter by:
<ul>
<li>(a) a party to the proceeding; or</li>
<li>(b) any other person;
<ul>
<li>the party ‚Ä¶ is taken not to have had reasonable grounds for making the representation, unless evidence is adduced to the contrary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="3">
<li>To avoid doubt, subsection (2) does not:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>(a) have the effect that, merely because such evidence to the contrary is adduced, the person who made the representation is taken to have had reasonable grounds for making the representation; or</li>
<li>(b) have the effect of placing on any person an onus of proving that the person who made the representation had reasonable grounds for making the representation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(4) Subsection (1) does not limit by implication the meaning of a reference in this Schedule to:
<ul>
<li>(a) a misleading representation; or</li>
<li>(b) a representation that is misleading in a material particular; or</li>
<li>(c) conduct that is misleading or is likely or liable to mislead;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>and, in particular, does not imply that a representation that a person makes with respect to any future matter is not misleading merely because the person has reasonable grounds for making the representation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SILENCE
<ul>
<li>At common law, silence is only a misrepresentation when there is a recognised duty to speak.</li>
<li>Under s 18, silence is misleading or deceptive in wider circumstances:</li>
<li>Where there is a common law duty to speak.</li>
<li>When the circumstances give right to a ‚Äòreasonable expectation‚Äô that the defendant would disclose something.</li>
<li>Demagogue Pty Ltd v Ramensky (1992) 39 FCR 31
<ul>
<li>Facts
<ul>
<li>Ramenskys bought terrace house off the plan.</li>
<li>Only vehicular access to land across land owned by third party.</li>
<li>Discussion and documents did not reveal that the driveway subject to approval by the third party.</li>
<li>Ramenskys argued that the failure to disclose the circumstances of the driveway was misleading or deceptive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The question is simply whether, having regard to all the relevant circumstances, there has been conduct that is misleading or deceptive or that is likely to mislead or deceive</li>
<li>That context may or may not include facts giving rise to a reasonable expectation, in the circumstances of the case for if particular matters exist they will be disclosed.</li>

<li>BMW required that the policy be ‚Äòassignable and cancellable‚Äô but did not clearly communicate this to Miller.</li>
<li>The policy was not assignable nor cancellable. Miller provided a copy of it to BMW before the money was loaned, but BMW did not read it.</li>
<li>Consolidated defaulted ‚Äì BMW sued Miller alleging that:

<li>PASSING ON INFORMATION
<ul>
<li>Butcher v Lachlan Elder Realty Pty Ltd (2004) 218 CLR 592
<ul>
<li>Facts
<ul>
<li>Lachlan Elder included a misleading survey in a brochure promoting a house for sale.</li>
<li>The brochure was short and contained two disclaimers.</li>
<li>The Butchers relied on the survey to make plans for development of the house.</li>
<li>After contracts exchanged, the Butchers discovered that the survey was inaccurate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>causal link between the impugned conduct and the loss that is claimed.</li>
<li>Character of the particular conduct of the particular agent in relation to the particular purchasers, bearing in mind what matters of fact each knew about the other as a result of the nature of their dealings and the conversations between them, or which each may be taken to have known.
<ul>
<li>Hence it would have been plain to a reasonable purchaser that the agent was not the source of the information which was said to be misleading.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DISCLAIMERS
<ul>
<li>Disclaim endorsement of and responsibility for the accuracy of a statement.

</ul>
</li>
<li>Campbell v Backoffice Investments Pty Ltd (2009) 238 CLR 304

</li>
<li>Butcher v Lachlan Elder Realty Pty Ltd (2004) 218 CLR 592

<ul>
<li>‚Äòa great opportunity exists to upgrade the building for a new tenant, owner/occupier or a developer who will strata the building.‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Of course, if the clause actually has the effect or erasing whatever is misleading in the conduct, the clause will be effective, not by any independent force of its own, but by actually modifying the conduct.
<ul>
<li>the suggestion of the suitability of the building for strata title conversion might continue to influence the mind of a prospective purchaser notwithstanding his awareness of the existence of a disclaimer clause, which did not single out the particular representation, but purported to apply generally to every detail stated in the investment report.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If a disclaimer clause has the effect of erasing whatever is misleading in the conduct, the clause will be effective, not by any independent force of its own, but by actually modifying the conduct.

<ul>
<li>(1) A court may:

<li>(a) on application of a person (the injured person) who has suffered, or is likely to suffer, loss or damage because of the conduct of another person that:
<ul>
<li>(i) was engaged in a contravention of a provision of Chapter 2, 3 or 4; or ‚Ä¶ make such order or orders as the court thinks appropriate against the person who engaged in the conduct, or a person involved in that conduct.</li>

<li>Gould v Vaggelas (1985) 157 CLR 215
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Notwithstanding that a representation is both false and fraudulent, if the plaintiff does not rely upon it, he or she has no case.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>If a material representation is made which is calculated to induce the plaintiff to enter into a contract and that person in fact enters into a contract there arises a fair inference of fact that he or she was induced to do so by the representation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="3">
<li>The inference may be rebutted, for example, by showing that the plaintiff, before he or she entered into the contract, either was possessed of actual knowledge or the true facts and knew them to be true or alternatively made it plain that whether, he or she knew the true facts or not, he or she did not rely on the representation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="4">
<li>The representation need not be the sole inducement. It is sufficient so long as it plays some part, even if only a minor part, in contributing to the formation of the contract. (Wilson J)</li>

<li>A subsequent declaration of non-reliance by a person said to have been affected by the conduct is more likely to be relevant to the question of causation</li>
<li>For if a person expressly declares in a contractual document that he or she did not rely upon pre-contractual representations, that declaration may, according to the circumstances, be evidence of non-reliance and of the want of a causal link between the impugned conduct and the loss or damage flowing from entry into the contract.</li>

<li>ACL s 18 is pleaded extensively in practice.</li>
<li>However, common law misrepresentation still exists ‚Äì used when the defendant‚Äôs conduct is not ‚Äòin trade or commerce‚Äô.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>MISTAKE</p>
<ul>
<li>Mistake can manifest in two ways in contract:
<ul>
<li>It can vitiate consent (be a reason to avoid a contract).</li>
<li>Be a typographical error in a written agreement.</li>
<li>Remedy is rectification: studied in 71116 Remedies</li>
<li>In this subject, we look at mistake as a reason to avoid a contract.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MISTAKE AS A VITIATING FACTOR
<ul>
<li>Mistake is very rarely pleaded and rarely found to void a contract:
<ul>
<li>The mistake must be fundamental: it must make the contract unworkable, or it must be unconscionable to enforce it in light of the mistake: Couturier v Hastie (1856) 10 ER 1065</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bell v Lever Bros [1932] AC 161
<ul>
<li>So the agreement of A and B to purchase a specific article is void if in fact the article had perished before the date of sale.
<ul>
<li>In this case, though the parties in fact were agreed about the subject-matter, yet a consent to transfer or take delivery of something not existent is deemed useless, the consent is nullified.‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Often the contract will allocate the risks of any mistake, which can be resolved by construction or implication of terms.
<ul>
<li>The mistake must not be due to the fault of the defendant.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>McRae v Commonwealth Disposals Commission (1951) 84 CLR 377
<ul>
<li>the Commission cannot in this case rely on any mistake as avoiding the contract, because any mistake was induced by the serious fault of their own servants, who asserted the existence of a tanker recklessly and without any reasonable ground.
<ul>
<li>The Commission contracted that a tanker existed in the position specified.
<ul>
<li>Since there was no such tanker, there has been a breach of contract, and the plaintiffs are entitled to damages for that breach</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Often the mistake can be resolved by operation of other vitiating factors which are easier to prove.
<ul>
<li>Esp, misrepresentation or misleading or deceptive conduct.</li>
<li>Mistake concerns the subjective intentions of the parties, but contract law is premised on how parties objectively manifest their intentions.</li>
<li>Certainty of contract would be unacceptably disrupted if parties could avoid contracts because of mistakes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Smith v Hughes (1871) LR 6 QB 597
<ul>
<li>The rule of law is that stated in Freeman v Cooke.
<ul>
<li>If, whatever a man‚Äôs real intention may be, he so conducts himself that a reasonable man would believe that he was assenting to the terms proposed by the other party, and that other party upon that belief enters into the contract with him, the man thus conducting himself would be equally bound as if he had intended to agree to the other party‚Äôs terms.‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Three types of mistake:
<ul>
<li>Common mistake: both parties make the same mistake.</li>
<li>Mutual mistake: The parties are at ‚Äòcross purposes‚Äô because both parties have made their own mistake.</li>
<li>Unilateral mistake: The parties are at ‚Äòcross purposes‚Äô but only one party is mistaken.</li>

<li>Such instruments are often signed by people who have not read and understood all their terms, but who are nevertheless committed to those terms by the act of signature or execution.

<li>INABILITY TO READ / UNDERSTAND

<li>INSTRUMENT RADICALLY DIFFERENT

<li>Mrs Gallie believed that she transferred her house to her nephew (Parkin) so that he and his business partner (Lee) could use it as security in their business venture.</li>
<li>She could not read the transfer because her glasses were broken.</li>
<li>In fact, the document transferred the house to Lee.</li>
<li>They used the house as security for a loan from Anglia and defaulted.</li>
<li>Anglia moved to sell the house.</li>
<li>Mrs Gallie argued that the transfer to Lee was void due to non est factum, thus she retained ownership of it.</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CARELESSNESS
<ul>
<li>Petelin v Cullen (1975) 132 CLR 355
<ul>
<li>The insistence that such precautions should be taken as a condition of making out the defence is of fundamental importance when the defence is asserted against an innocent person</li>
<li>It is otherwise when the defence is asserted against the other party to the transaction who is aware of the circumstances in which it came to be executed and who knows (because the document was signed on his representation) or has reason to suspect that it was executed under some misapprehension as to its character.
<ul>
<li>element of carelessness has no relevance for the present case.</li>
<li>The appellant‚Äôs belief that the document was a receipt was inspired by the agent‚Äôs representation</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>‚ÄòReasonable precautions‚Äô will depend upon the facts of the case.
<ul>
<li>For example:
<ul>
<li>Take reasonable steps to verify the contents of an instrument before signing.</li>
<li>Having a trusted person read/translate the instrument.</li>
<li>Wearing glasses or other aid if reasonably available.</li>

<li>Loan arranged through third party broker, so Perpetual was unaware of Ford‚Äôs incapacity.</li>
<li>Ford argued his signature was voided by non est factum.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The totality of the findings are clear that Mr Ford did not know what he was signing, in that he did not understand anything at all about the documents he was signing such that it can be concluded that his mind did not go with his pen.</p>

<li>UNILATERAL MISTAKE IN EQUITY
<ul>
<li>Equity can also void a written contract entered under a mistake about a fundamental term.
<ul>
<li>More than mistake is required: it must be unconscionable to hold the mistaken party to the signed document.</li>
<li>Typically, that requires the non-mistaken party to take steps to ensure the mistaken party does not discover their mistake.</li>
</ul>

<li>Goldsbrough Mort &amp; Co Ltd v Quinn (1910) 10 CLR 674
<ul>
<li>Quinn granted an option to sell his land for ‚Äò¬£1 10s per acre calculated on a freehold basis.‚Äô</li>
<li>Quinn was mistaken about how much he would receive.</li>

<li>Taylor v Johnson (1983) 151 CLR 422
<ul>
<li>Lead case in unilateral mistakes</li>
<li>Mrs Johnson granted an option to sell 10 acres of land to the Taylors, which they exercised.</li>
<li>Mrs Johnson believed that the price was $15,000 per acre.
<ul>
<li>The price recorded in both the option and later contract was $15,000 for the entire 10 acres.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Evidence suggested that the Taylors knew Mrs Johnson was mistaken and they actively prevented her from discovering the truth.</li>
<li>It is that a party who has entered into a written contract under a serious mistake about its contents in relation to a fundamental term will be entitled in equity to an order rescinding the contract if the other party is aware

</ul>
</li>
<li>Barton v Armstrong [1976] AC 104
<ul>
<li>‚Äò[An alleged case of duress] involves consideration of what the law regards as voluntary, or its opposite; for in life, including the life of commerce and finance, many acts are done under pressure, sometimes overwhelming pressure, so that one can say that the actor had no choice but to act.</li>
<li>Absence of choice in this sense does not negate consent in law: for this the pressure must be one of a kind which the law does not regard as legitimate. Thus, out of the various means by which consent may be obtained ‚Äì advice, persuasion, influence, inducement, representation, commercial pressure - the law has come to select some which it will not accept as a reason for voluntary action: fraud, abuse of relation of confidence, undue influence, duress or coercion.‚Äô (Lord Wilberforce and Lord Simon of Glaisdale (Dissent))</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The mere fact that pressure is applied ‚Äì even overwhelming pressure ‚Äì or that parties bargain from unequal bargaining positions is not sufficient to amount to duress.</li>
<li>Crescendo Management v Westpac (1988) 19 NSWLR 40
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe proper approach in my opinion is to: ask whether any applied pressure induced the victim to enter into the contract and then ask whether that pressure went beyond what the law is prepared to countenance as legitimate?
<ul>
<li>Pressure will be illegitimate if it consists of unlawful threats ‚Ä¶ But the categories are not closed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Even overwhelming pressure, not amounting to unconscionable or unlawful conduct, however, will not necessarily constitute economic duress.‚Äô (McHugh JA)</li>

<ul>
<li>‚ÄòIt is unnecessary, however, for the victim to prove that the illegitimate pressure was the sole reason for him entering into the contract.</li>
<li>It is sufficient that the illegitimate pressure was one of the reasons for the person entering into the agreement.</li>
<li>Once the evidence establishes that the pressure exerted on the victim was illegitimate, the onus lies on the person applying the pressure to show that it made no contribution to the victim entering into the agreement: Barton v Armstrong [1976] AC 104.‚Äô(McHugh JA)</li>

<li>the law vigilantly protects the sanctity of the person and property interests.</li>
<li>It‚Äôs harder to establish causation in economic duress cases, because the plaintiff will always have the option to refuse, seek legal advice, reserve rights, etc.</li>

</li>
<li>Mason v New South Wales (1959) 102 CLR 108
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòIt is all very well to say in such a case that there was an alternative to payment, namely to carry on as if ss. 12 and 28 had not been passed, resist the resulting prosecutions by pleading the invalidity of the Act, seek protection from the courts by injunction or otherwise in respect of a seizure, and appeal, if necessary to the Privy Council, against any unfavourable decision.

<li>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<ul>
<li>Common law duress requires the application of illegitimate pressure.</li>
<li>Equity will relieve a plaintiff of a contract obtained by ‚Äòundue‚Äô influence, which may be less than ‚Äòillegitimate‚Äô pressure.</li>
<li>Allcard v Skinner (1887) 36 Ch D 145
<ul>
<li>Or is it that it is right and expedient to save them from being victimised by other people?
<ul>
<li>In my opinion the doctrine of undue influence is founded upon the second of these two principles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On the other hand, to protect people from being forced, tricked or misled in any way by others into parting with their property is one of the most legitimate objects of all laws;
<ul>
<li>and the equitable doctrine of undue influence has grown out of and been developed by the necessity of grappling with insidious forms of spiritual tyranny and with the infinite varieties of fraud.‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>COMPARISON WITH DURESS
<ul>
<li>Duress is sometimes seen as an extreme form of undue influence.</li>
<li>Whereas:
<ul>
<li>a victim of duress will be consciously coerced into a contract,</li>
<li>undue influence can be subtle, well-intended and the victim may not be aware of it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Thorne v Kennedy (2017) 263 CLR 85
<ul>
<li>‚Äúno Court has ever attempted to define undue influence‚Äù‚Ä¶ the boundaries, particularly between undue influence and duress, are blurred.</li>
<li>One reason why there is no clear distinction is that undue influence can arise from widely different sources,</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2 FORMS OF UNDUE INFLUENCE
<ul>
<li>Johnson v Buttress (1936) 56 CLR 113
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe jurisdiction of a court of equity to set aside gifts [and contracts] inter vivos which have been procured by undue influence is exercised where

<li>

</ol>
<ul>
<li>Typically a trick (scared out of cookie)</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Credit and Commerce International SA v Aboody [1990] 1 QB 923
<ul>
<li>‚Äô‚Ä¶ we think that a person relying on a plea of actual undue influence must show that:
<ul>
<li>

<li>the other party to the transaction (or someone who induced the transaction for his own benefit) had the capacity to influence the complainant;</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>CAPACITY TO INFLUENCE
<ul>
<li>Influential relationships are very common, thus the capacity to influence is seldom difficult to establish.
<ul>
<li>Influential relationships can take infinite forms.</li>
<li>Often there will be unequal bargaining power.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Typically, the relationships involve close, personal relationships of trust, confidence or reliance:
<ul>
<li>Spouses</li>
<li>Family members</li>
<li>Professionals/clients</li>
<li>Religious teachers/followers</li>

<li>Over threats Persistent persuasion.</li>
<li>Taking advantage of someone at an unusual time or place ‚Äì esp if they‚Äôre distracted or vulnerable.</li>
<li>Taking advantage of a position of authority.</li>
<li>Merely being a silent, but forceful, presence in the room.</li>
<li>Having others apply pressure or persuasion.</li>

<li>Allcard v Skinner (1887) 36 Ch D 145
<ul>
<li>The law does not exclude influence. Nay, it recognises influence as natural and right.
<ul>
<li>Few, if any, men are gifted with characters enabling them to act, or even think, with complete independence of others, which could not largely exist without destroying the foundations of society.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But the law requires that, influence, however natural and right, shall not be unduly exercised, that is, shall be exercised only in due proportion to the surrounding circumstances and the strength of the person submitted to it.</li>
<li>The more powerful influence or the weaker patient alike evokes a stronger application of the safeguard ‚Ä¶‚Äô (157-158, Kewich J)</li>

<li>There is no doubt in my mind that the presumption has not been rebutted. ‚Ä¶ Rather it is my view that the evidence goes further than simply giving rise to the presumption; it establishes a case of actual undue influence.‚Äô (416-417, Duggan J)</li>

<li>2 CLASSES OF PRESUMED UNDUE INFLUENCE
<ul>
<li>Johnson v Buttress (1936) 56 CLR 113
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòWhere certain special relations exist undue influence is presumed</li>
<li>Wherever the relation between donor and donee is such that the latter is in a position to exercise dominion over the former by reason of the trust and confidence reposed in the latter, the presumption of undue influence is raised</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>FIDUCIARY RELATIONSHIPS
<ul>
<li>If the relationship between the parties is fiduciary, then the law will presume undue influence on proof of that relationship without more.
<ul>
<li>Examples:
<ul>
<li>Solicitor to client</li>
<li>Doctor to patient</li>
<li>Religious adviser to disciple</li>
<li>Parent (or person in loco parentis) to child</li>
<li>Guardian to ward</li>
<li>Trustee to beneficiary</li>
<li>DOES NOT INCLUDE: Siblings; Child/Parent; Husband/Wife;</li>
<li>Employer/employee; Banker/customer</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation (1984) 156 CLR 41
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe critical feature of these relationships is that the fiduciary undertakes or agrees to act for or on behalf of or in the interests of another person in the exercise of a power or discretion which will affect the interests of that other person in a legal or practical sense.
<ul>
<li>The relationship between the parties is therefore one which gives the fiduciary a special opportunity to exercise the power or discretion to the detriment of that other person who is accordingly vulnerable to abuse by the fiduciary of his position.‚Äô (96-97, Mason J)</li>

<li>PRESUMPTION IN FACT
<ul>
<li>Johnson v Buttress (1936) 56 CLR 113
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe [fiduciary] relations mentioned, however, do not constitute an exhaustive list of the cases in which undue influence will be presumed from personal relations.
<ul>
<li>Wherever the relation between donor and donee is such that the latter is in a position to exercise dominion over the former by reason of the trust and confidence reposed in the latter, the presumption of undue influence is raised ‚Ä¶ .</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Facts
<ul>
<li>Mr Buttress: low intelligence, illiterate, totally dependant on Mrs Johnson in business and finance matters.</li>
<li>Mr Johnson gave away his only real asset to Mrs Johnson during his lifetime.</li>
<li>Mr Johnson‚Äôs estate sought to rescind the transfer by raising a presumption of undue influence.</li>

<li>One occupying such a position falls under a duty in which fiduciary characteristics may be seen.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tulloch (deceased) v Braybon (No 2) [2010] NSWSC 650 (17 June 2010)
<ul>
<li>In my opinion, ‚Ä¶ more than mere confidence and reciprocal influence is required to establish a ‚Äúspecial relationship of influence‚Äù from the existence of which undue influence will be presumed unless rebutted;
<ul>
<li>for a relationship to be brought within the doctrine, it must go beyond one of mere confidence and influence, to one involving dominion or ascendancy by one over the will of the other, and correlatively dependence and subjection on the part of the other.</li>

<li>[34] ‚Ä¶ A presumption ‚Ä¶ arises where common experience is that the existence of one fact means that another fact also exists.</li>
<li>Common experience gives rise to a presumption that a transaction was not the exercise of a person‚Äôs free will if
<ul>
<li>(i) the person is proved to be in a particular relationship, and</li>
<li>(ii) the transaction is one, commonly involving a ‚Äúsubstantial benefit‚Äù to another, which cannot be explained by ‚Äúordinary motives‚Äù, or ‚Äúis not readily explicable by the relationship of the parties‚Äù.‚Äù (Kiefel CJ, Bell, Gageler, Keane and Edelman JJ)</li>

<li>It is necessary for the [defendant] to prove that the gift was the result of the free exercise of independent will.
<ul>
<li>The most obvious way to prove this is by establishing that the gift was made after the nature and effect of the transaction had been fully explained to the [plaintiff] by some independent and qualified person so completely as to satisfy the Court that the [plaintiff] was acting independently of any influence from the [defendant] and with the full appreciation of what he was doing;</li>
</ul>

<li>Equity is the ‚Äòcourt of conscience‚Äô, hence, many of its principles are directed to preventing unconscionable conduct.</li>

</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>that disability was sufficiently evident to the stronger party to make it prima facie unfair or ‚Äúunconscientious‚Äù that he procure, or accept, the weaker party‚Äôs assent to the impugned transaction in the circumstances in which he procured or accepted it.</li>

<li>SPECIAL DISADVANTAGE
<ul>
<li>Blomley v Ryan (1956) 99 CLR 362
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe circumstances adversely affecting a party, which may induce a court of equity either to refuse its aid or to set a transaction aside, are of great variety and can hardly be satisfactorily classified.
<ul>
<li>Among them are poverty or need of any kind, sickness, age, sex, infirmity of body or mind, drunkenness, illiteracy or lack of education, lack of assistance or explanation where assistance or explanation is necessary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The common characteristic seems to be that they have the effect of placing one party at a serious disadvantage vis-a-vis the other.‚Äô (405, Fullagar J)</li>

</li>
<li>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) v Samton Holdings Pty Ltd (2002) 117 FCR 301
<ul>
<li>[48] Under the rubric of unconscionable conduct, equity will:
<ul>
<li>(i) Set aside a contract or disposition resulting from the knowing exploitation by one party of the special disadvantage of another.</li>
<li>The special disadvantage may be constitutional, deriving from age, illness, poverty, inexperience or lack of education</li>

<li>Commercial Bank of Australia v Amadio (1983) 151 CLR 447
<ul>
<li>I qualify the word ‚Äúdisadvantage‚Äù by the adjective ‚Äúspecial‚Äù in order to disavow any suggestion that the principle applies whenever there is some difference in the bargaining power of the parties and in order to emphasize that the disabling condition or circumstance is one which seriously affects the ability of the innocent party to make a judgment as to his own best interests</li>

<li>CG refused to renew the lease unless the Roberts discontinued a claim against it, and released CG from future claims.</li>
<li>Roberts independently advised not to sign the release.</li>

<li>Many, perhaps even most, contracts are made between parties of unequal bargaining power, and good conscience does not require parties to contractual negotiations to forfeit their advantages, or neglect their own interests‚Ä¶</li>

<ul>
<li>[161] Equitable intervention to deprive a party of the benefit of its bargain on the basis that it was procured by unfair exploitation of the weakness of the other party requires proof of a predatory state of mind.
<ul>
<li>Heedlessness of, or indifference to, the best interests of the other party is not sufficient for this purpose.</li>
<li>The principle is not engaged by mere inadvertence, or even indifference, to the circumstances of the other party to an arm‚Äôs length commercial transaction.</li>

<li>Nitopi v Nitopi [2022] NSWCA 162
<ul>
<li>[9] In my view, the only way to reconcile Kakavas and Thorne in relation to questions of knowledge is that Kakavas must be understood as standing as authority only for the negative proposition that constructive notice is insufficient but not as standing for the additional proposition that constructive knowledge of a special disadvantage in the sense I have explained is also insufficient. (Bell CJ)</li>
<li>[10] ‚Ä¶ Constructive notice, in the sense of being on notice of facts that might lead on inquiry to discovery of the existence of a special disadvantage, is insufficient. (Bell CJ)</li>

</li>
<li>Nitopi v Nitopi [2022] NSWCA 162
<ul>
<li>[28] In Wu v Ling [2016] NSWCA 322 at [14], Leeming JA observed in considering the passage from Kakavas extracted at [23] above that ‚Äúvictimisation in this context is no narrow concept‚Äù.</li>
<li>His Honour was surely correct in so doing. ‚Ä¶ were it otherwise, it becomes almost impossible to accommodate statements of high authority to the effect that the passive acceptance or retention of a benefit may, in certain circumstances, be unconscionable and result in a transaction being set aside or a gift successfully impeached.

<li>EVIDENCE OF EXPLOITATION

<li>Blomley v Ryan (1956) 99 CLR 362, 405
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòIt does not appear to be essential in all cases that the party at a disadvantage should suffer loss or detriment by the bargain. ‚Ä¶</li>
<li>But inadequacy of consideration, while never of itself a ground for resisting enforcement, will often be a specially important element in cases of this type. It may be important in either or both of two ways firstly as supporting the inference that a position of disadvantage existed, and secondly as tending to show that an unfair use was made of the occasion.‚Äô (406, Fullagar J)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Kakavas v Crown Melbourne Limited (2013) 250 CLR 392
<ul>
<li>Kakavas = ‚Äòhigh roller‚Äô gambler.</li>
<li>Crown encouraged Kakavas to gamble by providing him benefits such as free accommodation etc.</li>
<li>Kakavas lost $20m in 1 year.</li>
<li>Kakavas wanted to void the transactions by arguing that he was addicted to gambling and Crown exploited that disadvantage.</li>
<li>High Court held that he was not at a special disadvantage and Crown had no knowledge.</li>
<li>Gambling transactions are a rare, if not unique, species of economic activity in a civilised community, in that each party sets out openly to inflict harm on the counterparty.</li>
<li>The plaintiff must be able to point to conduct on the part of the defendant, beyond the ordinary conduct of the business, which makes it just to require the defendant to restore the plaintiff to his or her previous position.</li>

<li>Johnson v Smith [2010] NSWCA 306
<ul>
<li>Mother with dementia gifted $540,000 to son.</li>
<li>Gift was notionally for the purpose of giving the son funds to spend on his mother‚Äôs wellbeing if she needed it.</li>
<li>However, he denied any legal obligation to spend it only on his mother.</li>
<li>Was it unconscionable for him to retain the gift unconditionally?</li>
<li>it is the attempt to retain the benefit obtained from the special disadvantage of his mother that is the issue.</li>
<li>This may occur because of the unconscientious use of power arising or existing in the circumstances or (as here) the unconscientious attempt to retain the benefit obtained from the person with the special disadvantage.‚Äù</li>

<li>Stubbings v Jams 2 Pty Ltd (2022) 96 ALJR 271
<ul>
<li>Lawyer (agent for lenders) contrived a system of communication that kept borrowers at a distance so that they would not become aware of any special disadvantages (ie, wilful blindness)</li>
<li>Borrowers obliged to obtain advice and provide signed:

<li>Certificate of Financial Advice; and</li>
<li>Certificate of Legal Advice.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>‚Ä¶ The certificates might also be seen to have been a precautionary artifice designed to prevent an inference that the respondents were wilfully blind to the obvious danger to the appellant.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[49] ‚Ä¶ Indeed, one might regard the deployment of such artifices in a context where the lender or its agent deliberately distances itself from evidence that must confirm the dangerous nature of the transaction for the borrower or its guarantor as evidence pointing to an exploitative state of mind on the part of the lender.

<li>‚Äò‚Ä¶relief on the ground of ‚Äúunconscionable conduct‚Äù is usually taken to refer to the class of case in which a party makes unconscientious use of his superior position or bargaining power to the detriment of a party who suffers from some special disability or is placed in some special situation of disadvantage.‚Äô (461)
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòAlthough unconscionable conduct in this narrow sense bears some resemblance to the doctrine of undue influence, there is a difference between the two.</li>
<li>In the latter the will of the innocent party is not independent and voluntary because it is overborne.</li>
</ul>

<li>In the former the will of the innocent party, even if independent and voluntary, is the result of the disadvantageous position in which he is placed and of the other party unconscientiously taking advantage of that position.‚Äô</li>

<li>Third party Impropriety
<ul>
<li>If A contracts with B because A was unduly influenced by C - and B knew that A was unduly influenced by C - then equity will allow A to rescind the contract with B.
<ul>
<li>Equity allows this because, even though B did not engage in undue influence, it is still unconscionable to knowingly profit from someone who was not able to properly consent to the contract.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>THIRD PARTY IMPROPRIETY
<ul>
<li>Bainbrigge v Browne (1881) 18 Ch D 188
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe inference of undue influence operates not only ‚Äúagainst the person who is able to exercise the influence‚Äù, but ‚Äúagainst ‚Ä¶ every person who claimed under him with notice of the equity thereby created, or with notice of the circumstances from which the court infers the equity ‚Ä¶‚Äô (197, Fry LJ</li>

<li>THIRD PARTY ACTUAL UNDUE INFLUENCE
<ul>
<li>Khan v Khan (2004) 62 NSWLR 229
<ul>
<li>Facts
<ul>
<li>Mrs Sadiq and her son orally agreed to sell a newly-built house to Mr and Mrs Khan.</li>
<li>The Khans moved in before settlement but relations with Mrs Sadiq soured.</li>
<li>Mrs Sadiq repudiated the agreement.</li>
<li>Meeting of families called, presided over by local mufti. (Islamic jurist who can advise on religious law.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The meeting lasted for hours.
<ul>
<li>Her family and mufti pressured Mrs Sadiq to complete the sale.</li>
<li>The purchasers were present at all times.</li>
<li>Mrs Sadiq was a religious person. The mufti quoted several religious authorities and said that she would be rewarded in the afterlife.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Held
<ul>
<li>[21] In the ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúthird party‚Äù case ‚Ä¶ evidence must ‚Ä¶ show that
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>[the third party] had influence over [a party to the contract ‚Äì‚Äòinfluenced party‚Äô];</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>that [the third party] exercised that influence so that what [the influenced party] did was the result of the influence rather than [the influenced party]‚Äòs will; and that</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="3">
<li>[the other party to the contract] unconscientiously derived a benefit from the conduct of [the influenced party] knowing that that conduct was a result of the influence of [the third party] rather than [the influenced party]‚Äòs will. (Barrett J)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The case is one in which Mrs Sadiq, under the religious influence of Mufti Naiem, contracted to dispose of property to [the purchasers] who had notice of that influence and the effect of it upon Mrs Sadiq‚Äôs will.
<ul>
<li>The bargain under which they received a benefit from Mrs Sadiq is therefore one which equity regards as unconscionable and will not allow to be enforced against Mrs Sadiq.</li>

<li>THIRD PARTY PRESUMED UNDUE INFLUENCE
<ul>
<li>Bank of NSW v Rogers (1941) 65 CLR 42
<ul>
<li>Uncle had cared for Miss Rogers for 23 years after her parents were killed.</li>
<li>Uncle faced bankruptcy and owed money to the Bank.</li>
<li>Uncle persuaded Miss Rogers to provide her only substantial asset as security.</li>
<li>Miss Rogers did not know Uncle faced bankruptcy and was unlikely to recover.</li>
<li>She signed the documents at the Bank but it did not explain the transaction to her.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Facts justify the inference ‚Ä¶ that the bank knew that some special relationship existed
<ul>
<li>it was for the bank to establish that the security given to it by the respondent was free from any undue influence and was the voluntary and well-understood act of her mind</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At no time when the respondent signed any document charging her shares in favour of the bank was she severed from Gardiner‚Äôs influence. ‚Ä¶</li>
<li>The question the bank‚Äôs conscience is fettered against retaining the securities by notice of the relation between Gardiner and the respondent or of the circumstances in which Gardiner procured them.‚Äô</li>

<li>Wives‚Äô equity
<ul>
<li>In Yerkey v Jones (1939) 63 CLR 649, Dixon J held that equity protects a wife who guarantees the debts of her husband, when the person to whom she provides a guarantee takes that guarantee knowing that she is the wife of the debtor husband.
<ul>
<li>In Garcia v National Australian Bank (1998) 194 CLR 395, the High Court almost unanimously endorsed this principle as good law.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Garcia v National Australia Bank (1998) 194 CLR 395
<ul>
<li>Mr and Mrs Garcia were directors of Citizens Gold, a company, in practice, run by Mr Garcia.</li>
<li>1979: The Garcias grant a mortgage over the family home security ‚Äòall moneys‚Äô owing.</li>
<li>1987: Mrs Garcia executed personal guarantee in favour of Citizens Gold.
<ul>
<li>Told by Mr Garcia that there was no risk.</li>
<li>Did not understand that it was covered by the mortgage.</li>
<li>Bank did not explain it to her.</li>
</ul>

<li>1988: The Garcias divorce. Mrs Garcia seeks declaration that guarantee is unenforceable.</li>

</li>
<li>1st Class: ACTUAL UNDUE INFLUENCE
<ul>
<li>Garcia v National Australia Bank (1998) 194 CLR 395
<ul>
<li>[25] Thus, Dixon J was dealing with two kinds of case. In the former, the case of actual undue influence</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2ND CLASS: WIFE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND
<ul>
<li>[23] In his reasons for decision in Yerkey v Jones, Dixon J dealt with at least two kinds of circumstances:
<ul>
<li>the first in which there is actual undue influence by a husband over a wife and</li>
<li>the second ‚Ä¶ in which there is no undue influence but there is a failure to explain suretyship transaction which the husband seeks to have the wife enter for the immediate economic benefit not of the wife but of the husband, or the circumstances in which her liability may arise.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Yerkey v Jones begins with the recognition that the surety is a volunteer</li>
<li>VOLUNTEER
<ul>
<li>Notice of husband/wife relationship sufficient to ground the claim:
<ul>
<li>no need for notice of undue influence or other impropriety.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The wife must be a ‚Äòvolunteer‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>NOTICE OF MARRIAGE RELATIONSHIP
<ul>
<li>Garcia v National Australia Bank (1998) 194 CLR 395
<ul>
<li>[40] We consider that the only question of notice that arises is whether the creditor knew at the time of the taking of the guarantee that the surety was then married to the borrower.</li>
<li>Other questions of notice do not intrude.</li>
<li>And what makes it unconscionable to enforce it in the second kind of case is the combination of circumstances that
<ul>
<li>a) in fact the surety did not understand the purport and effect of the transaction;</li>
<li>b) the transaction was voluntary (in the sense that the surety obtained no gain from the contract the performance of which was guaranteed);</li>
<li>c) the lender is to be taken to have understood that, as a wife, the surety may repose trust and confidence in her husband in matters of business and therefore to have understood that the husband may not fully and accurately explain the purport and effect of the transaction to his wife; and yet</li>
<li>d) the lender did not itself take steps to explain the transaction to the wife or find out that a stranger had explained it to her.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Just wives?
<ul>
<li>Presently, only wives may seek the protection of the principle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Remedies
<ul>
<li>Defective performance def
<ul>
<li>If a binding contract is not performed properly by a defaulting party, then the law can provide the following remedies to the ‚Äòinnocent‚Äô party.
<ul>
<li>First, if the contract has been seriously breached or repudiated, then the innocent party use the ‚Äòself-help‚Äô remedy of terminating the contract. We looked at these concepts of termination for breach and repudiation in Module 7.</li>
<li>Second, the law can order the defaulting party to pay damages in place of performance, or it can order the defaulting party to specifically perform it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Impaired consent def
<ul>
<li>If a party is bound to a contract that they did not properly consent to, then the law provides a remedy in the form of rescission.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>TERMINATION / RESCISSION
<ul>
<li>TERMINOLOGY
<ul>
<li>Terminate def/ Termination def
<ul>
<li>Used to describe the legal effect of:</li>
<li>A party‚Äôs decision to end a contract because of breach or repudiation.</li>
<li>A frustrating event.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rescind def / rescission def
<ul>
<li>Used to describe the legal effect of a party‚Äôs decision to void a contract because of a vitiating factor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Highfield Property Investments Pty Ltd v Commercial &amp; Residential Developments (SA) Pty Ltd [2012] SASC 165
<ul>
<li>The word ‚Äúrescission‚Äù is ambiguous. It is sometimes used to encompass not only ‚Äúrescission‚Äù ab initio for misrepresentation but also ‚Äúrescission‚Äù prospectively for breach and sometimes just to refer to ‚Äúrescission‚Äù ab initio for misrepresentation.
<ul>
<li>For clarity, I use that term exclusively to denote a rescission which has the effect of avoiding the contract (and actions taken under it) from the outset (eg for misrepresentation) and I use the term ‚Äútermination‚Äù to denote a termination of future performance only (or dissolution) of the contract (eg for breach).</li>

<li>TERMINATION

<li>Rights unconditionally acquired before termination are enforceable.</li>
<li>Secondary terms intended to survive termination are enforceable.</li>
<li>McDonald v Dennys Lascelles Ltd (1933) 48 CLR 457
<ul>
<li>When a party to a simple contract, upon breach by the other contracting party of a condition of the contract, elects to treat the contract as no longer binding upon him, the contract is not rescinded as from the beginning.
<ul>
<li>Both parties are discharged from the further performance of the contract, but rights are not divested or discharged which have already been unconditionally acquired.</li>
<li>Rights and obligations that arise from the partial execution of the contract and causes of action which have accrued from its breach alike continue unaffected.‚Äô</li>

<li>Election
<ul>
<li>Election def
<ul>
<li>If a party has the right to end a contract - whether that is a right to terminate because of the other party‚Äôs default or a right to rescind because their consent was vitiated - then that party must choose whether to end the contract.</li>
<li>The process of choosing is called ‚Äòelection‚Äô.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>PART 1 HOW TO ELECT
<ul>
<li>Election is a general legal principle that applies when a person must choose between legally inconsistent outcomes.</li>
<li>When a contract is voidable due to vitiating conduct, the plaintiff must choose (elect) between two legally inconsistent outcomes:
<ul>
<li>Rescind the contract; or</li>
<li>Affirm (and continue to be bound by) the contract.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once the choice is unequivocally made, the plaintiff cannot change their mind.</li>
<li>Eg, if a plaintiff has elected to affirm the contract, then rescission or termination is no longer possible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A binding election requires:
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Full knowledge of the ‚Äòmaterial facts‚Äô (ie, at least knowledge of the vitiating conduct; maybe also knowledge of the right to rescind.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Unequivocal conduct indicating affirmation or rescission/termination</li>
<li>Conduct is judged objectively:
<ul>
<li>there is no need for the plaintiff to subjectively intend to elect.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sargent v ASL Developments Ltd (1974) 131 CLR 634
<ul>
<li>Term in contract for the sale of land provided a right to terminate if certain planning controls were imposed over the land.</li>
<li>The planning controls were imposed.</li>
<li>Despite this, the sellers continued to perform the contract.</li>
<li>32 months later, the sellers purported to terminate the contract, relying on the term.
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe words or conduct ordinarily required to constitute an election must be unequivocal in the sense that it is consistent only with the exercise of one of the two sets of rights and inconsistent with the exercise of the other ‚Ä¶ For an election there need be no actual, subjective intention to elect ‚Ä¶ an election is the effect which the law attributes to conduct justifiable only if such an election had been made</li>

<li>Tropical Traders Ltd v Goonan (1964) 111 CLR 41
<ul>
<li>Contract for the sale of land provided for payment of the price in instalments over 5 years.</li>
<li>Time was of the essence for payment of the balance on 6 January 1963.</li>
<li>6 Jan: Purchaser failed to pay and asked for 3 more months.</li>
<li>Seller: ‚ÄòThe company will not take action under the contract until Monday, 14 January</li>

</li>
<li>Tropical Traders Ltd v Goonan (1964) 111 CLR 41
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe company will not take action under the contract until Monday, 14 January but this must be regarded as an act of grace on the part of the Company and without prejudice to and in no way varying the Company‚Äôs right to strict enforcement of the contract.‚Äô</li>

<li>Immer (No 145) Pty Ltd v Uniting Church in Australia Property Trust (NSW) (1993) 182 CLR 26
<ul>
<li>Sale of air rights subject to Council approval by 1 April 1989.</li>
<li>Approval not granted by 1 April: both parties in a position to terminate.</li>
<li>26 June: Immer sends settlement documents to the</li>
<li>Trust under mistaken belief that the Council had approve the transfer.</li>
<li>26 August: Immer terminates the contract.
<ul>
<li>Were its actions consistent only with an intention to keep the agreement on foot and inconsistent with the exercise of the right to rescind</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>‚ÄòIf a party to a contract, faced with the choice of terminating the contract or keeping it on foot, terminates the contract that party will ordinarily have acted in a way that leaves no doubt as to the choice made.‚Äô (41, Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ)
<ul>
<li>‚Äô‚Ä¶ at the heart of election is the idea of confrontation which in turn produces the necessity of making a choice.</li>
<li>But in a case such as the present one, the choice is not merely one of affirming the agreement; it involves as well the abandonment of the right to rescind.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>‚Äô ‚Ä¶ where the right to rescind is a continuing one, it is not so readily concluded that the party entitled to rescind has abandoned that right completely as opposed to taking no action to exercise the right at the time in question. (42, Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ)</li>

<li>Rogue had sold the car to Universal Finance: did Caldwell rescind before this sale?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Restrictions on the right to end a contract
<ul>
<li>Even if a party wants to terminate or rescind a contract, they may find that their right to do so is lost.</li>
<li>Affirmation
<ul>
<li>The right to elect presents the relevant party with two inconsistent choices:
<ul>
<li>either end the contract (ie, terminate or rescind it) or affirm it and continue performing.</li>
<li>If the the party elects to affirm the contract, then the right to end it is lost unless a ‚Äòfresh‚Äô right to end it later accrues.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>RESTRICTIONS: AFFIRMATION
<ul>
<li>The plaintiff must elect to end or affirm a contract when:
<ul>
<li>The contract is breach or repudiated.</li>
<li>Their consent was vitiated.</li>
<li>A contingency is fulfilled providing a right to terminate.</li>
<li>But sometimes the plaintiff‚Äôs choice is restricted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If seller affirms:
<ul>
<li>Right to terminate is surrendered.</li>
<li>Seller can sue for damages.</li>
<li>Parties obliged to continue performing</li>

<ul>
<li>‚ÄòAlthough he may do so, the other party does not have to accept the repudiation.</li>
<li>He may continue to treat the contract as on foot and hold the party guilty of repudiation to the performance of his obligations.</li>
<li>If those obligations remain unperformed when the time for performance arrives, the anticipatory breach will be converted into an actual breach.</li>
<li>If the other party keeps the contract alive, he does so not only for his own benefit but also for the benefit of the party guilty of repudiation.</li>

<li>Coastal Estates Pty Ltd v Melevende [1965] VR 433
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòIn my opinion, affirmation as a defence to a claim to rescind a contract rests on the principle that having elected to adhere to a contract after discovery of the falsity of the representations inducing it, the right to rescind is lost.</li>
<li>In other words affirmation is the determination of an election by affirming the contract.</li>
<li>Affirmation may take the form of an express communication from the representee that he has elected to treat the contract as binding, or conduct of his in relation to the contract or its subject matter from which the proper inference is that he has so elected.‚Äô (452, Adam J)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Termination: RESTRICTIONS: Ready, Willing and Able
<ul>
<li>Focusing now on the right to terminate for breach or repudiation, the party who has such a right will not be able to terminate the contract if they are not ready, willing and able to perform it.</li>
<li>A plaintiff who wishes to elect for breach or repudiation must be ‚Äòready, willing and able‚Äô to perform their own obligations at the time of election.
<ul>
<li>Psaltis v Schultz (1948) 76 CLR 547
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòTo be ready and willing to perform a contract a party must not only be disposed to do the act promised but also have the capacity to do it.</li>
<li>But the tenor of the promise will show when and how the act is to be performed and it is to that time and mode of performance that the capacity and disposition to fulfil the promise are to be directed.‚Äô (560, Dixon J)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<li>If the only question is whether a purported termination is effective to put an end to the contract so as to discharge both parties from future performance, then anticipatory breach by one will justify termination by the other whether or not the latter is ready and willing to perform.</li>
<li>However, if the latter wants to obtain any relief on the basis of the termination, beyond mere discharge of future obligations, then as part of its cause of action it must prove readiness, willingness and ability. (Hodgson JA, Young JA agreeing at [145])</li>
<li>A further and more difficult question is whether ‚Ä¶ a party who is also in breach of the contract ‚Ä¶ can terminate despite its own breach.
<ul>
<li>The answer is that generally it can, at least unless the obligations breached are interdependent or the breach by the party wishing to terminate has caused the breach that this party wishes to rely on.</li>

<li>Foran v Wight (1989) 168 CLR 385
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThey were not required to show that upon the day stipulated for settlement they were ready and willing to tender the purchase price.</li>
<li>They were absolved from the obligation of placing themselves in a position to be able to tender the purchase price upon that day by reason of the representation of the vendors two days earlier.‚Äô (454, Dawson J)
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòAll that the purchasers were required to show was that at the time of the repudiation, that is, at the time they were absolved from future performance, there was not a ‚Äúsubstantial incapacity‚Äù on their part or a ‚Äúdefinitive resolve or decision‚Äù against the performance of their obligations.‚Äô (454, Dawson J)</li>

<ul>
<li>RESCISSION: INTERVENING THIRD PARTY
<ul>
<li>Focusing now on the right to rescind because of a vitiating factor, rescission will not be allowed if the parties cannot be restored to their pre-contractual positions.</li>
<li>Rescission:
<ul>
<li>Voids the contract.</li>
<li>Obliges the parties to restore each other to their pre- contractual positions.</li>
<li>If the parties cannot be restored, then rescission will be denied.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Example
<ul>
<li>Seller induces purchaser to buy a car with a fraudulent misrepresentation.</li>
<li>Purchaser paints the car a different colour and negligently damages it.</li>
<li>Purchaser discovers fraud.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rescission may be denied if purchaser cannot return the care in the same condition as it was transferred to them.</li>
<li>Contracts tainted by a vitiating factor are voidable, not void.
<ul>
<li>Voidable contracts allow title in property to pass, unless and until the contract is rescinded.</li>
<li>If the contract is not rescinded before that title is passed to an innocent third party, then the right to rescind is lost.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On rescission, ownership of property immediately reverts to original owner (plaintiff).

<li>When a party (the ‚Äòcontractor‚Äô) earns the right to payment for performance of an obligation.
<ul>
<li>When a contractor earns a right to payment under a contract, the contractor can sue for payment in an action called ‚Äòdebt‚Äô.</li>
<li>That right to payment exists independently of the contract, hence, if the contract is terminated after a right to payment has accrued, then the contractor can still sue on the debt owing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ACTIONS FOR DEBT

<li>Contracts typically consist of the provision of goods/services for money.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Payments independent of performance
<ul>
<li>Not all rights to payment depend upon the contractor first performing.
<ul>
<li>The parties are free to make payments independent of performance, and such payments are claimable as debts owing at the time(s) provided for in the contract.</li>
<li>A classic example of this is the deposit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>PAYMENTS INDEPENDENT OF PERFORMANCE
<ul>
<li>The right to payment does not have to depend on performance.</li>
<li>Parties can provide that payments are due at any time.</li>
<li>If so, the right to sue in debt arises on the arrival of the due date.</li>

<li>‚ÄòI prefer to approach the problem by asking whether an unconditional right to recover and retain the deposit arose before the contract was discharged.</li>

<p>Introduction to damages and specific performance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damages</p>
<ul>
<li>As foreshadowed in tutorial discussions, damagesLinks to an external site. are also available for breach of contract.</li>
<li>They are available for any breach; the right to them does not depend upon the classification of the term.</li>
<li>So, damages are available for breaches of ‚Äòmere‚Äô warranties.</li>
<li>Damages seek to provide a money equivalent of performance in place of the defective performance provided by the defendant.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specific performance</p>
<ul>
<li>Damages is the remedy provided by the common law.</li>
<li>Equity can also provide a remedy: specific performance.</li>
<li>It is also available to remedy an actual - or threatened - breach of contract.</li>

<ul>
<li>GUIDING PRINCIPLE
<ul>
<li>Robinson v Harmon (1848) 154 ER 363
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe rule of the common law is, that where a party sustains a loss by reason of a breach of contract, he is, so far as money can do it, to be placed in the same situation, with respect to damages, as if the contract had been performed.‚Äô (365, Parke B)</li>

<li>EXPECTATION DAMAGES
<ul>
<li>Commonwealth v Amann Aviation Pty Ltd (1992) 174 CLR 64
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe award of damages for breach of contract protects a plaintiff‚Äôs expectation of receiving the defendant‚Äôs performance.</li>
<li>the amount of damages awarded will be commensurate with the plaintiff‚Äôs expectation, objectively determined,</li>
<li>That is to say, a plaintiff must prove, on the balance of probabilities, that his or her expectation of a certain outcome, as a result of performance of the contract, had a likelihood of attainment rather than being mere expectation.‚Äô</li>

</li>
<li>ASSESSMENT OF DAMAGES
<ul>
<li>Moore v Scenic Tours Pty Ltd [2020] HCA 17
<ul>
<li>[64] ‚Ä¶ a fundamental difference between two components of compensatory damages for breach of contract,</li>
<li>Those components are compensation directly for the performance interest and compensation for consequential losses</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Example 1
<ul>
<li>Purchaser agrees to buy good for $10,000.</li>
<li>On date of delivery, purchaser breaches the contract by refusing to take and pay for the good.</li>
<li>On the date of breach, the market value of the good is $9,000.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Example 1: Assessment
<ul>
<li>Expectation interest is compensated by awarding $1,000.</li>
<li>This puts the seller in the position that they would have been in had the contract been performed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Example 2
<ul>
<li>Purchaser agrees to buy good for $10,000.</li>
<li>On date of delivery, purchaser breaches the contract by refusing to take and pay for the good.</li>
<li>On the date of breach, the market value of the good is $9,000.</li>
<li>Purchaser spends $250 storing the good before selling it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Example 2: Assessment
<ul>
<li>Expectation interest: $1,000; and</li>
<li>Consequential loss: $250</li>
<li>This puts the seller in the position that they would have been in had the contract been performed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CAUSATION
<ul>
<li>The plaintiff must show that the loss that they are claiming for was caused by the breach of contract.</li>
<li>March v E &amp; MH Stramare (1991) 171 CLR 506
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe common law tradition is that what was the cause of a particular occurrence is a question of fact which ‚Äúmust be determined by applying common sense to the facts of each particular case‚Äù ‚Ä¶‚Äô (Mason CJ)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>REMOTENESS
<ul>
<li>Even if the plaintiff proves that loss was caused by a breach of contract, then the defendant will not be liable if the loss is too remote.</li>
<li>Test: ‚Äòreasonable contemplation‚Äô test.</li>
<li>Hadley v Baxendale (1854) 156 ER 145
<ul>
<li>fairly and reasonably be considered arising naturally, that is, according to the usual course of things, from such breach of contract itself, or such as may reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties at the time they made the contract,</li>
<li>If special circumstances under which the contract was actually made were communicated by the plaintiffs to the defendants, and thus known to both parties, the damages resulting from the breach of such a contract, which they would reasonably contemplate, would be the amount of injury which would ordinarily follow from a breach of contract under these special circumstances so known and communicated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CONCLUSION

<p>BAILMENT</p>
<ul>
<li>Hobbs v Petersham Transport Co Pty Ltd (1971) 124 CLR 220
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòA bailment comes into existence upon the delivery of goods of one person, the bailor, into the possession of another person, the bailee, upon a promise, express or implied, that they will be redelivered to the bailor or dealt with in a stipulated way.‚Äô (238, Windeyer J)</li>

<p>Morris v C W Martin &amp; Sons Ltd [1966] 1 QB 716</p>
<ul>
<li>‚ÄúOnce a man has taken charge of goods as a bailee for reward, it is his duty to take reasonable care to keep them safe:
<ul>
<li>and he cannot escape that duty be delegating it to his servant.
<ul>
<li>If the goods are lost or damaged, whilst they are in his possession, he is liable unless he can show - and the burden is on him to show - that the loss or damage occurred without any neglect or default or misconduct of himself or of any of the servants to whom he delegated his duty.‚Äù</li>

<li>‚ÄúBut in the present case what is important, I think, is to recognize that the evident purpose of the clause is to free the appellant from all the responsibility (for loss and damage) to which otherwise its assumption of the position of bailee would have subjected it.</li>
<li>The clause is part and parcel of the bargain by which the bailment was created and the reciprocal rights and obligations of the parties as bailor and bailee were regulated.
<ul>
<li>The concern of the clause, as read in the setting in which it came to be agreed upon (assuming that it was agreed upon), was with the legal responsibility which the appellant‚Äôs acceptance of the bailment should entail.‚Äù</li>

<p>CONTRACTS REVIEW ACT 1980 (NSW)</p>
<ul>
<li>West v AGC (Advances) Ltd (1986) 5 NSWLR 610
<ul>
<li>‚ÄúThe Contracts Review Act 1980 is revolutionary legislation whose evident purpose is to overcome the common law‚Äôs failure to provide a comprehensive doctrinal framework to deal with ‚Äòunjust‚Äô contracts.‚Äù (621, McHugh JA)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd v Khoshaba [2006] NSWCA 41 [115] ‚Ä¶
<ul>
<li>Thus, while equity provides relief against the unconscientious conduct of the defendant, the Act may permit relief in circumstances where the conscience of the defendant is not affected.</li>
<li>Similarly, a contract, or a provision thereof, may be unjust in circumstances where there was no pre-existing duty owed by, say, a lender to a borrower to act in a particular way. (Basten JA)</li>

</li>
<li>Magill v Magill (2006) 226 CLR 551
<ul>
<li>The modern tort of deceit will be established where a plaintiff can</li>
<li>show five elements of deceit:
<ul>
<li>first, that the defendant made a false representation;</li>
<li>secondly, that the defendant made the representation with the knowledge that it was false, or that the defendant was reckless or careless as to whether the representation was false or not</li>
<li>thirdly, that the defendant made the representation with the intention that it be relied upon by the plaintiff;</li>
<li>fourthly, that the plaintiff acted in reliance on the false representation; and</li>
<li>fifthly, that the plaintiff suffered damage which was caused by reliance on the false representation.</li>

</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>the illegitimacy of the pressure exerted</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Duress involves illegitimate pressure amounting to compulsion</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>Undue influence (equity)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Plaintiff might be capable of looking after own interests, but is subject to (elements of undue influence):
<ul>
<li>pressure</li>
<li>influence</li>
<li>manipulation</li>
<li>misinformation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>such that the plaintiff cannot be said to have exercised free will.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Undue influence involves a skewing of free will but not necessarily through illegitimate means.
<ul>
<li>Unconscionable conduct involves taking advantage of a vulnerable party; often considered an extension or subset of undue influence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Undue influence + unconscionable conduct
<ul>
<li>Facts suggest that plaintiff:
<ul>
<li>was at a special disadvantage vis-a-vis the defendant; AND</li>
<li>influence was applied by the defendant such that the plaintiff did not exercise his or her own free will.</li>
<li>D must show signing is fair, just, and reasonable</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Undue Influence
<ul>
<li>Johnson v Buttress (1936) 56 CLR 113
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe jurisdiction of a court of equity to set aside gifts [and contracts] inter vivos which have been procured by undue influence is exercised where
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>undue influence is proved as a fact, or [‚Äòactual undue influence‚Äô]</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>where, undue influence being presumed from the relations existing between the parties, the presumption has not been rebutted.‚Äô [‚Äòpresumed undue influence‚Äô]</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Duress vs Undue influence
<ul>
<li>The defense of duress exists to protect against contracts that are obtained by some type of threat or coercion.</li>
<li>The defense of undue influence exists for a more specialized role, to protect against assent obtained by unfair persuasion.</li>

<li>Gibson v Manchester City Council
<ul>
<li>1970 Change of government during gibson purchasing freehold title to council housing
<ul>
<li>Tried to remove this idea, said no binding agreement</li>
<li>Gibson completed an application form, said there was a contract after valuation</li>
<li>Judge upheld gibson as open contract</li>
<li>Appeal - dissent held that it was a negotiating step for contract, owing to the change in the political complexion of the council, never reached fruition.</li>
<li>Words used in valuation to sell are ‚Äúmay be prepared to sell‚Äù and not, to accept the offer,
<ul>
<li>but ‚Äúto make formal application to buy‚Äù upon the enclosed application form.</li>
<li>‚ÄúThis letter should not be regarded as a firm offer of a mortgage.‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>However, gibson after correspondence replied with
<ul>
<li>‚Äúcarry on with the purchase as per my application already in your possession</li>

<li>when an offer is made, it is necessary in order to make a binding contract,
<ul>
<li>not only that it should be accepted</li>
<li>but that the acceptance should be notified</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This offer is continuous and never revoked, no notification necessary, all elements necessary to form binding contract
<ul>
<li>However vagueness of language shows that a legal promise was never intended</li>

</li>
<li>Judge is interpreting the offer as correct usage + getting influenza or cold or other diseases caused by taking cold within a reasonable time after so using it

<li>No acceptance of contract because he never mentioned or knew of it nor performance, so no contract.</li>

<li>But acceptance is essential to contractual obligation, because without it there is no agreement, and in the absence of agreement, actual or imputed, there can be no contract</li>

<li>While silence alone is not an acceptance silence of an offeree in conjunction with the other circumstances of the case may indicate that he has accepted the offer.</li>
<li>knowing of the terms of the offer and the offeror‚Äôs intention to enter into a contract, he has exercised a choice and taken the benefit of the offer</li>

<ul>
<li>Consideration
<ul>
<li>The second element necessary for contract formation is consideration</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consideration Essential elements - Bargain theory authority on Consideration
<ul>
<li>Case: Australian Woollen Mills Pty Ltd v Commonwealth (1954) 92 CLR 424 (Privy Council); (1955) 93 CLR 546 (High Court of Australia)</li>
<li>Jurisdiction: Privy Council; High Court of Australia</li>
<li>Facts: Australian Woollen Mills Pty Ltd (AWM) claimed a unilateral contract arose from the Commonwealth government‚Äôs wool subsidy scheme.
<ul>
<li>The scheme subsidized wool purchases for woollen product manufacturers after World War II to ensure low prices.</li>
<li>The Commonwealth promised subsidies to manufacturers buying domestic-use wool.</li>
<li>AWM purchased wool based on this promise but later repaid excess subsidies due to scheme discontinuation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Procedural History: AWM sued Commonwealth for recovery of repaid subsidies and unpaid subsidies on certain purchases</li>
<li>Issue Raised: Whether the letters from Commonwealth constituted a binding offer to form unilateral contracts with manufacturers like AWM.</li>
<li>Legal Reasoning and Ratio:
<ul>
<li>The alleged contracts were of the unilateral type, with acceptance through performance.</li>
<li>To establish a contract, the statement must be offered as consideration for an act, with a quid pro quo relationship between the statement and the act.</li>
<li>In cases like these, the presence of an implied or express request by the alleged promisor is essential to determine the existence of an offer.</li>
<li>The intention to create a legally enforceable duty must be present in the offer.</li>
<li>An implied request can provide a useful test for determining a true offer and acceptance for contract formation.</li>
<li>In this case, the letters from the Commonwealth were statements of policy, not contractual offers. The scheme was more administrative than contractual.</li>
<li>The presence of a request does not automatically establish a contract; it depends on the intention to create an obligation.</li>
<li>Consideration must be sufficient, not adequate
<ul>
<li>(consideration definition).</li>
<li>a contract should be a bargain supported by consideration in the nature of a quid pro quo</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ratio
<ul>
<li>ratio decidendi of Australian Woollen Mills Pty Ltd v Commonwealth is that the expenditure of money in reliance on an announcement by the government that it would pay a subsidy to a manufacturer on wool purchased and used for local manufacture is not itself sufficient to create a contract to pay the subsidy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Result: The court dismissed AWM‚Äôs claim, ruling that no binding contracts were constituted, and the Commonwealth‚Äôs letters were statements of policy rather than contractual offers. The appeal was also dismissed by the Privy Council.</li>

<li>Occupied land without payment - per agreement</li>
<li>Dillwyn v Llewelyn - ‚Äúan exception to the modern requirement that a contract should be a bargain supported by consideration in the nature of a quid pro quo‚Äù. (consideration definition).</li>
<li>consideration must be satisfied in the form of a price in return for the promisor‚Äôs promise or a quid pro quo.
<ul>
<li>duties arising from bargains entered between free parties were to be enforced, not duties deriving from suggested moral obligations such as those deriving from relationships</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Currie v Misa (1875) LR 10 Exch 153 at 162</li>
<li>A valuable consideration, in the sense of the law, may consist either in some right, interest, profit, or benefit accruing to one party, or some forbearance, detriment, loss, or responsibility, given, suffered, or undertaken by the other.‚Äù</li>
<li>The contract
<ul>
<li>Three situations
<ul>
<li>a promise to transfer property subject to the occurrence of an event or condition
<ul>
<li>promise will not be enforceable even if the event or condition [183] occurs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>a promise to transfer property after which the promisor allows the promisee to act to his detriment in reliance on the promise.
<ul>
<li>equity may prevent the promisor insisting on his strict rights and may enforce the promise</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>where the promise contains an express or implied request by the promisor to do an act or fulfill a condition</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Frustration
<ul>
<li>subdivision is not a legal impossibility; it is possible that in all the circumstances the council might permit the land to be subdivided to enable the title to lot B to pass to the plaintiff</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>MAHONEY JA: [175] In my opinion, the transaction between the parties constituted a contract

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adequacy OF CONSIDERATION
<ul>
<li>adequacy of consideration refers to its intrinsic value
<ul>
<li>Adequate consideration vs sufficient or good consideration</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Woolworths Ltd v Kelly (1991) 22 NSWLR 189
<ul>
<li>If courts were to entertain disputes concerning the adequacy, or inadequacy, of consideration for a bargain, and if such issues were justiciable, they would lead to litigation prone to open up a vast territory of evidence.</li>
<li>Bargains are too uncertain</li>
<li>Economic freedom from paternalistic courts</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SUFFICIENCY OF CONSIDERATION
<ul>
<li>Past consideration
<ul>
<li>Past consideration is not considered sufficient consideration.
<ul>
<li>Thus, if P performs an apparently gratuitous service for D and D later promises to pay P for that service, D‚Äôs promise will not be enforceable unless specifically agreed.</li>

<li>Case Summary: Foakes v Beer (1884) 9 App Cas 605 (House of Lords)
<ul>
<li>Appeal Information: This was an appeal from the Court of Appeal.</li>
<li>Facts:
<ul>
<li>On 11 August 1875, Beer obtained a judgment against Foakes for a debt amounting to ¬£2 090 19s.</li>
<li>On 21 December 1876, a memorandum of agreement was made and signed by Foakes and Beer.</li>
<li>This agreement specified that if Foakes paid ¬£500 immediately and further installments of ¬£150 on specified dates until the full sum was paid off, Beer would not proceed with the judgment.</li>
<li>By June 1882, Beer took out a summons to proceed on the judgment, leading to a trial on the matter of the debt‚Äôs status.</li>
<li>It was determined at trial that Foakes had paid all required instalments but Beer claimed unpaid interest.</li>
<li>Cave J found in favour of Foakes, believing Beer could not execute any sum due to the agreement.</li>
<li>The Queen‚Äôs Bench Division upheld the decision. However, the Court of Appeal reversed it, favoring Beer‚Äôs claim for the interest.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Judgment (Earl of Selbourne LC):
<ul>
<li>[610] Raised doubts about whether the agreement meant waiving the interest Beer was entitled to by law.</li>
<li>[611] Stressed that the agreement could not be legally enforced against Beer unless there was consideration.</li>
<li>The main question was whether paying a lesser amount than the full debt could be considered legal satisfaction for the whole debt.</li>
<li>Referenced the doctrine stated by Sir Edward Coke in Pinnel‚Äôs case from 1602. According to this, paying a lesser amount could not satisfy a larger debt.</li>
<li>The doctrine made a distinction between agreements under seal and those not under seal. The former is binding, while the latter requires consideration.</li>
<li>[614] The creditor‚Äôs benefit from getting part of their money does not serve as legal consideration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Lords (LORD WATSON, LORD FITZGERALD):
<ul>
<li>Both concurred with Earl of Selbourne LC‚Äôs conclusions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>LORD BLACKBURN:
<ul>
<li>[622] Emphasized that many men of business would see value in prompt payment of part of a debt rather than waiting for full payment, especially when there‚Äôs doubt about the debtor‚Äôs solvency.</li>
<li>Had reservations about fully agreeing with the majority opinion but did not elucidate his full dissent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Decision: The appeal was dismissed, upholding the Court of Appeal‚Äôs decision in favor of Beer.</li>

<li>Defendant/Respondent: Roffey Bros &amp; Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Facts:
<ul>
<li>Roffey Bros held a contract to refurbish 27 flats.</li>
<li>Williams was subcontracted by Roffey Bros for carpentry for ¬£20,000.</li>
<li>Williams faced financial difficulties due to the low agreed price.</li>
<li>To ensure completion and avoid penalties for delay, Roffey Bros orally agreed to pay Williams an extra ¬£10,300, at ¬£575 per flat.</li>
<li>Williams continued work but stopped after seven weeks when he had only been paid ¬£1,500 by the defendants.</li>
<li>Roffey Bros did not pay the outstanding balance.</li>
<li>Roffey Bros then hired other carpenters to finish the work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Issue:
<ul>
<li>Was there consideration for Roffey Bros‚Äô promise to pay Williams an additional ¬£10,300, at the rate of ¬£575 per completed flat?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Holding:
<ul>
<li>Yes, there was consideration for the promise.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reasoning:
<ul>
<li>The main contention was the traditional legal principle from Stilk v Myrick that performing an existing contractual obligation is not good consideration for a new promise.</li>
<li>It was recognized that the promise to pay more was in both parties‚Äô interests.</li>
<li>Roffey Bros derived practical benefits,
<ul>
<li>such as ensuring Williams continued his work, avoiding penalties, and avoiding the costs of hiring new carpenters.</li>
<li>Practical benefits means that the benefit of not receiving the full amount is still worth it because they are providing enough of a service to get by</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>GLIDEWELL LJ outlined a proposition that refined the traditional principle, stating that if a party obtains a benefit from a promise, and it isn‚Äôt due to duress or fraud, it can be considered good consideration.</li>
<li>Based on these findings, the promise by Roffey Bros was supported by valuable consideration and is enforceable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Judgment:
<ul>
<li>The appeal was dismissed. Williams‚Äô agreement with Roffey Bros was legally binding and enforceable.</li>

<ul>
<li>Jurisdiction: Binding in New South Wales.</li>
<li>Procedural History:
<ul>
<li>Plaintiffs were tenants of a fruit and vegetable shop owned by the defendant.</li>
<li>A larger competing fruit and vegetable shop was introduced in the same shopping center, threatening plaintiffs‚Äô ability to pay rent.</li>
<li>Defendant initially promised reduced rent but later sought to withdraw the promise.</li>
<li>Plaintiffs sought a declaration that the reduced rent promise was binding.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Original Dispute:
<ul>
<li>Plaintiffs‚Äô ability to pay rent was threatened due to competition from a larger tenant.</li>
<li>Defendant initially promised reduced rent but later wanted to withdraw this promise.</li>

<li>Current Reason for Trial:
<ul>
<li>To determine whether the reduced rent promise by the landlord was binding.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Result:

<p>Case Summary (Detailed)</p>
<ul>
<li>Name of the Case and Citation:
<ul>
<li>Williams v Roffey Bros &amp; Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd [1991] 1 QB 1</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jurisdiction:
<ul>
<li>England and Wales (Court of Appeal)</li>
<li>Binding within its jurisdiction and persuasive in many common law jurisdictions globally.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Procedural History:
<ul>
<li>Williams initially brought the case to the Queen‚Äôs Bench Division seeking the extra payment as promised by Roffey Bros.</li>
<li>The matter was then appealed to the Court of Appeal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Original Dispute:
<ul>
<li>The initial disagreement was concerning the amount payable under a carpentry contract.</li>
<li>Williams struggled to complete the work at the originally agreed price due to unforeseen financial hardships.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Current Reason for Trial:
<ul>
<li>The appeal sought to determine whether Roffey Bros‚Äô promise to pay extra, despite no new consideration being apparent, was enforceable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Material Facts:
<ul>
<li>Williams and Roffey Bros entered into a contract where Williams was to provide carpentry services for a predetermined price.</li>
<li>Due to unforeseen financial constraints, Williams approached Roffey Bros, indicating he could not finish the work at the agreed price.</li>
<li>To avoid the inconvenience and potential additional costs of sourcing a new carpenter, Roffey Bros agreed to pay an additional sum per flat completed.</li>
<li>Roffey Bros, despite witnessing Williams continue his work with the understanding of the new agreement, did not pay the promised additional amounts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Issue Raised by the Material Facts:
<ul>
<li>The primary legal question was whether the promise by Roffey Bros to pay more, without any apparent fresh consideration, constituted an enforceable agreement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Precedences:
<ul>
<li>The court revisited Stilk v Myrick (1809), where it was ruled that a party‚Äôs promise to perform a duty they‚Äôre already contractually obligated to perform doesn‚Äôt amount to valid consideration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tests:
<ul>
<li>The court explored if Roffey Bros derived a ‚Äúpractical benefit‚Äù from the revised terms with Williams, even if Williams was only carrying out his existing duty.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Words and Phrases Considered:
<ul>
<li>Key terms assessed included ‚ÄúConsideration‚Äù, ‚ÄúPractical benefit‚Äù, and ‚ÄúEconomic duress‚Äù.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What Each Judge Thought:
<ul>
<li>All judges in the Court of Appeal, while noting the principles from Stilk v Myrick, agreed that in modern commerce, if a party receives a practical benefit from varied terms, even if there‚Äôs no new consideration in the classic sense, that can make the varied terms enforceable.</li>
<li>They recognized the commercial reality and the practical benefit derived by Roffey Bros in ensuring the continued services of Williams.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Legal Reasoning and Ratio of the Case:
<ul>
<li>The court emphasized that the doctrine of consideration shouldn‚Äôt be a tool for injustice.</li>
<li>If one party derives a practical benefit from varied terms, even if those terms merely ensure the performance of an existing duty, such an agreement can be enforceable.</li>
<li>The evolution of business practices and the need for commercial efficacy played a role in this decision.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Result:
<ul>
<li>The Court of Appeal ruled in favor of Williams, holding that Roffey Bros must honor their promise to pay the additional amounts as they derived a genuine practical benefit from the revised agreement.</li>
<li>The potential inconvenience and additional costs they avoided by not having to find a new carpenter were deemed significant.</li>
</ul>

<p>Re Selectmove Ltd [1995] 1 WLR 474</p>
<ul>
<li>if the principle from ‚ÄúWilliams v Roffey Bros‚Äù (i.e., a promise to perform an existing contractual obligation can be good consideration if the promisor gains a practical benefit) were extended to the obligation to make payment, it would essentially negate the principle set in ‚ÄúFoakes v Beer.‚Äù
<ul>
<li>Foakes v beer principle: if you owe someone money and they agree to let you pay less to settle the entire debt, that agreement isn‚Äôt enforceable unless there‚Äôs something additional given in return.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Court of Appeal can‚Äôt overrule or sidestep ‚ÄúFoakes v Beer‚Äù based on the principles from ‚ÄúWilliams v Roffey Bros.</li>
<li>Need higher authority to evaluate</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Duty owed to a third party</p>
<ul>
<li>A promise to perform an act which the promisor is under an existing duty to a third party to perform may constitute good consideration.
<ul>
<li>A‚Äôs promise to B to perform a duty which A is already contractually obliged to perform for C
<ul>
<li>May = consideration</li>

<li>Original Dispute:
<ul>
<li>Share transfer transaction dispute between Pao On and Lau Yiu Long over a guarantee provision.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Current Reason for Trial:
<ul>
<li>Challenge to the validity of a guarantee provision under the threat of canceling an existing agreement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Material Facts:
<ul>
<li>Share transfer agreement in question.</li>
<li>Guarantee provision to ensure share price stability.</li>
<li>Threat to cancel a subsidiary agreement unless the guarantee was provided.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Issue Raised by the Material Facts:
<ul>
<li>The validity of forming a contract (guarantee provision) under commercial pressure or perceived duress.</li>

<li>‚ÄúCoercion of Will‚Äù</li>
<li>‚ÄúPublic Policy‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What Each Judge Thought:</li>
<li>Legal Reasoning and the Ratio of the Case:
<ul>
<li>Contracts formed under coercion of will can be considered voidable.</li>
<li>Mere commercial pressure isn‚Äôt enough for a contract to be voidable.</li>
<li>Upholding the sanctity of contracts unless they‚Äôre undermined by specific factors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Result:
<ul>
<li>Appeal in favor of Pao On and others was allowed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Significance &amp; Precedents Set for the Future:
<ul>
<li>The case of Pao On v Lau Yiu Long is significant for several reasons:
<ul>
<li>Clarification on Consideration: The case delved into the nuances of valid consideration, specifically examining whether fulfilling a pre-existing duty can serve as valid consideration.
<ul>
<li>This establishes a clearer boundary for future commercial transactions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Duress vs. Commercial Pressure: One of the most impactful outcomes of this case was the distinction it drew between contracts formed under genuine duress (coercion of will) and those formed under mere commercial pressure.
<ul>
<li>This ensures that not every aggressive negotiation or hard bargaining situation can be used as grounds to set aside a contract.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Upholding Contract Sanctity: By reinforcing the principle that contracts are to be respected unless there are clear undermining factors, the case sent a strong message about the importance of commercial agreements and the legal system‚Äôs commitment to upholding them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Overall, Pao On v Lau Yiu Long sets important precedents for commercial law, especially in situations where the validity of contracts and agreements is under scrutiny due to external pressures or perceived threats.
<ul>
<li>It provides valuable guidance for future cases where the distinction between genuine duress and mere commercial pressure is in question.</li>

<ul>
<li>Intention
<ul>
<li>The third element of contract formation is that the parties must manifest an intention to create legal relations.
<ul>
<li>parties may reach a clear and certain agreement that satisfies the consideration requirement, but may not be intended to create legal relations:
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Where an agreement is made in a commercial context, a question may arise whether the parties intend to make an honourable, rather than legal commitment.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>The issue may arise in a social or domestic context.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>An agreement to help a friend to move some furniture in return for dinner involves an exchange of promises, but is clearly not intended to be legally binding.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An agreement relating to more substantial matters, such as employment or the sale of valuable property, may be intended to attract legal consequences even when it is made with a close relative.</li>
<li>
<ol start="3">
<li>An issue of intention to contract may arise where an agreement is made between a government and an individual.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The implementation of government policy may, for example, lead a government to reach an agreement with a particular individual to provide some assistance.</li>
<li>The fact that the individual is providing something in return for that assistance does not necessarily mean that the parties intend to make a contract.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="4">
<li>Where parties reach a preliminary agreement, the question may arise whether the parties intend to be bound immediately, or not until some time in the future when the parties have finalised some outstanding issues or recorded their agreement in a more formal manner.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>certain types of agreements are presumed to be intended to be binding, while others are presumed not to be made with such an intention.</li>
<li>A person denying the enforceability of a commercial agreement has been said to bear the onus of proving that the parties did not intend legal consequences.

</ul>
</li>
<li>Procedural History:
<ul>
<li>Archbishop Ermogenous initiated the case seeking employment benefits.</li>
<li>The trial court ruled in favor of the Greek Orthodox Community of SA.</li>
<li>The decision was overturned by the Supreme Court of South Australia.</li>
<li>The matter was then appealed to the High Court.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Original Dispute:
<ul>
<li>The primary question was whether there existed a contractual relationship between Archbishop Ermogenous and the Greek Orthodox Community of SA Inc that could give rise to employment benefits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Current Reason for Trial:
<ul>
<li>The appeal before the High Court was to ascertain if such a contractual relationship was legally recognized.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Material Facts:
<ul>
<li>Archbishop Ermogenous received an offer of employment which he accepted.</li>
<li>While their relationship was primarily spiritual, there were stipulated duties and compensations, leading to a contention of whether it was contractual.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Issue Raised by the Material Facts:
<ul>
<li>Does a spiritual calling and relationship exclude the possibility of a legally enforceable contractual relationship?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Precedences:
<ul>
<li>The case referenced precedents such as Rogers v Booth and Lewery v Salvation Army, which dealt with similar issues.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tests:
<ul>
<li>The court looked at the objective intentions of the parties.</li>
<li>They examined if there was a clear offer, acceptance, and consideration that would make up a valid contract.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Words and Phrases Considered:
<ul>
<li>‚ÄúContractual intention‚Äù, ‚Äúspiritual duties‚Äù, ‚Äúenforceable rights‚Äù, ‚Äúoffer‚Äù, ‚Äúacceptance‚Äù, and ‚Äúconsideration‚Äù.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What Each Judge Thought:
<ul>
<li>While nuances between judges‚Äô opinions might exist, the High Court generally acknowledged that a spiritual relationship doesn‚Äôt preclude a legal contract.</li>
<li>They noted that the terms between the Archbishop and the Greek Orthodox Community were more than mere spiritual obligations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Legal Reasoning and Ratio of the Case:
<ul>
<li>The Court emphasized that the determination of a contract doesn‚Äôt rest solely on the nature of the duties (spiritual vs. secular).</li>
<li>It is about the intention of the parties.</li>
<li>If the terms are clear, providing legal rights and duties, it can be considered a contract even if it‚Äôs within a religious context.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Result:
<ul>
<li>The High Court allowed the appeal, meaning they recognized the possibility of a contractual relationship between Archbishop Ermogenous and the Greek Orthodox Community of SA.</li>

<li>Banque Brussels Lambert v Australian National Industries Case Summary:</li>
<li>Case Name: Banque Brussels Lambert v Australian National Industries (1989) 21 NSWLR 502</li>
<li>Procedural history:
<ul>
<li>The case has progressed through lower courts where the nature and implications of the ‚Äúletter of comfort‚Äù have been debated.</li>
<li>It follows the line of cases such as Kleinwort Benson and Edwards v Skyways Ltd that deal with the enforceability of certain contractual terms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Original dispute:
<ul>
<li>The dispute initially centered around the interpretation of a ‚Äúletter of comfort‚Äù provided by ANI during financial negotiations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Current reason for trial:
<ul>
<li>The court was asked to determine whether the statements made in the ‚Äúletter of comfort‚Äù were legally binding promises or mere representations, and if ANI had indeed breached any such promises.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Material facts:
<ul>
<li>ANI and Banque Brussels Lambert were involved in a financial negotiation regarding a US$1 million facility.</li>
<li>Upon the bank‚Äôs insistence, this was increased to a US$5 million facility, contingent upon ANI providing a ‚Äúletter of comfort‚Äù to give assurance of the deal‚Äôs soundness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Issue raised by the material facts:
<ul>
<li>Were the statements made in the ‚Äúletter of comfort‚Äù legally enforceable promises?
<ul>
<li>If so, did ANI breach these promises?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Precedences:
<ul>
<li>The court looked to prior decisions like Edwards v Skyways Ltd, Kleinwort Benson [1988] 1 WLR 799, and Chemco Leasing SpA v Redifusion plc.</li>
<li>These cases provided guidance on when seemingly non-binding terms might be enforced and the intent behind such terms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tests:
<ul>
<li>The court sought to identify:
<ul>
<li>If the statements in the ‚Äúletter of comfort‚Äù bore any promissory intent.</li>
<li>Whether ANI and Banque Brussels Lambert had an understanding that these terms were binding.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Words and Phrases Considered:
<ul>
<li>The court scrutinized phrases such as ‚ÄúLetter of comfort,‚Äù evaluating its typical usage in the financial sector.</li>
<li>Additionally, terms like ‚ÄúIntention‚Äù and ‚ÄúPromise‚Äù were analyzed to determine their weight in the given context.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What each judge thought:
<ul>
<li>While individual opinions might have varied in nuance, the judges largely agreed that commercial transactions should not be nullified based on mere semantics.</li>
<li>They leaned towards upholding the weight of commercial intent over strict linguistic interpretation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Legal reasoning and the ratio:
<ul>
<li>The court‚Äôs rationale was underpinned by the notion that commercial bargains, especially those involving significant stakes, should be honored.</li>
<li>If statements within such bargains have a promissory shade, they ought to be seen as binding, barring clear evidence to the contrary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Result:
<ul>
<li>The court found ANI liable, holding that certain statements within the ‚Äúletter of comfort‚Äù bore binding intent and that ANI had breached them.</li>

<ul>
<li>intention to create legal relations.
<ul>
<li>voyage by the plaintiffs to Australia to reside with the defendant at her home.</li>
<li>The discourse touches upon various legal principles surrounding contracts, including:
<ul>
<li>Offer and Acceptance:
<ul>
<li>A contract is formed when there‚Äôs an offer by one party and acceptance by another.</li>
<li>This offer and acceptance can be explicit or implied from conduct or language.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consideration:
<ul>
<li>For a contract to be binding, there must be something of value exchanged between the parties, known as consideration.</li>
<li>Consideration can take many forms such as a right, interest, benefit, or even forbearance or responsibility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Intention:
<ul>
<li>The parties must intend the agreement to be legally binding.</li>
<li>This intention can be explicit or implicit.</li>
<li>Factors like language used, the situation of the parties, and the surrounding circumstances can indicate the presence or absence of such intention.</li>
<li>In some situations, legal enforceability is presumed, especially in business arrangements.</li>
<li>However, in personal or domestic arrangements, such presumption may be doubtful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Certainty:
<ul>
<li>The terms of a contract must be clear.</li>
<li>If the terms are vague, uncertain, or still subject to negotiation, it might be unenforceable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>License:
<ul>
<li>The plaintiffs were given a licence to reside with the defendant.</li>
<li>The text examines the revocability of this licence and the conditions under which it becomes irrevocable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implication of Terms:
<ul>
<li>Sometimes, terms are not explicitly stated but are implied to make the contract operational according to the intention of the parties.</li>
<li>The terms must be necessary to the nature of the contract and directly related to its purpose.</li>

<ul>
<li>Masters v Cameron (1954) 91 CLR 35</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Clarify the procedural history of the case.
<ul>
<li>Appeal from the Supreme Court of Western Australia</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What the original dispute was
<ul>
<li>Cameron (the respondent) and Mr and Mrs Masters (the appellants) signed a document whereby Cameron agreed to sell and the Masters agreed to buy for ¬£17,500 a certain property owned by Cameron.</li>
<li>The purchasers encountered financial difficulties, denied that they were legally bound to purchase the property, and sought to recover the deposit</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Current reason for trial
<ul>
<li>Is the document on its true construction constitutes a binding contract between the respondent and the appellants, or only a record of terms upon which the signatories were agreed as a basis for the negotiation of a contract</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ascertain the material facts
<ul>
<li>Plainly enough they were agreed that there should be a sale and purchase, and the parties, the property, the price, and the date for possession were all clearly settled between them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>State the issue raised by the material facts

<ul>
<li>THE COURT (DIXON CJ, McTIERNAN and KITTO JJ):
<ul>
<li>3 classes of contract in this case:
<ul>
<li>Everything is ready, but want to have the terms restated in a form which will be fuller or more precise but not different in effect.
<ul>
<li>Most common</li>
<li>Rossiter v Miller (1878) 3 App Cas 1124,</li>
<li>as soon as the fact is established of the final mutual assent of the parties so that those who draw up the formal agreement have not the power to vary the terms already settled, I think the contract is completed‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Duplicate contract, but made performance of one or more of the terms conditional upon the execution of a formal document.
<ul>
<li>Niesmann v Collingridge (1921) 29 -</li>
<li>Rich and Starke JJ observed that this did not make the signing of a contract a condition of agreement, but made it a condition of the obligation to pay, and carried a necessary implication that each party would sign a contract in accordance with the terms of agreement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Or the intention of the parties is not to make a concluded bargain at all, unless and until they execute a formal contract.
<ul>
<li>are cases in which the terms of agreement are not intended to have, and therefore do not have, any binding effect of their own</li>

<li>Intro, Completeness
<ul>
<li>certainty and completeness
<ul>
<li>if the parties have entered into a contract, then it must contain enough terms to function properly,</li>
<li>and those terms must be expressed adequately clearly so that a court can enforce them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Introduction
<ul>
<li>How certain do the terms of an agreement have to be before the law will recognise it to be a legally binding contract?
<ul>
<li>Difficult (if not impossible) for parties to anticipate and provide for every contingency.
<ul>
<li>Also can be difficult for parties to articulate themselves so there is only one interpretation and no ambiguity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Raises issues of sufficiency ‚Äî what is sufficiently complete and what is sufficiently certain.</li>
<li>It is fact specific ‚Äî nature of agreement and circumstances in which agreement was made.</li>
<li>Judicial attitudes differ in their opinions as to the degree of certainty and completeness required, and the extent to which the courts should till gaps and resolve ambiguities.</li>
<li>Trend ‚Äî judges increasingly willing to fill gaps and resolve ambiguities (implied terms).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Certainty aspects
<ul>
<li>Sufficiently certain</li>
<li>Sufficiently complete</li>
<li>Promise must NOT Illusory
<ul>
<li>A promise is discretionary - don‚Äôt have to do it</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Completeness Overview
<ul>
<li>Parties must have reached agreement on all of its essential terms.
<ul>
<li>What is an essential term?
<ul>
<li>A term without which the contract cannot be enforced.</li>
<li>A term which only the parties can supply.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Whether an omission is fatal to contract formation depends on three main factors
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>How important or essential is the term that is missing?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Meaning of essentiality in this context: Milne v Attorney-General (Tas) (1956) 95 CLR 460</li>
<li>Whether the courts can fill the gaps by applying an objective or reasonable standard.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>Have the parties turned their mind to the issue?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Why has the term been left out? Was it deliberately left out or was it by mistake?</li>
<li>Agreements to agree are not enforceable. The court will generally not fill the gap in these circumstances.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="3">
<li>Has the agreement been partly executed?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>If one of the parties has already performed all or some of the contract, the courts are less likely to find that an agreement is incomplete (Foley v Classique).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Note: A mechanism or formula can be used to set an essential term, and this will not result in a contract being void for want of certainty.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sufficiently Complete: Essential Terms
<ul>
<li>For a contract to be sufficiently complete, parties must have reached agreement on all essential terms.</li>
<li>Consider: What is an essential term?
<ul>
<li>A term without which the contract cannot be enforced.</li>
<li>A term which only the parties can supply.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Milne v Attorney-General (Tas) (1956) 95 CLR 460 upholds this</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>HOW IMPORTANT / ESSENTIAL IS THE MISSING TERM?
<ul>
<li>The threshold question is whether the parties have specifically agreed on all the terms that only they can decide.</li>
<li>What matters is whether the court can enforce the contract in the absence of the term in question, without exceeding its role as the interpreter, rather than the author, of the contract.</li>
<li>If the parties have failed to agree on essential terms, the court will refuse to find an enforceable contract.</li>
<li>Depends on nature of the contract and circumstances of the case
<ul>
<li>The complexity of the contract and the courts understanding of and familiarity with the type of transaction.</li>
<li>The reason why the parties failed to reach agreement on the issue.</li>
<li>Whether the agreement remains wholly executory or has been wholly or partly</li>
<li>performed on one side.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Examples
<ul>
<li>Lease of land
<ul>
<li>Essential
<ul>
<li>The commencement date,</li>
<li>the rental to be paid,</li>
<li>parties,</li>
<li>subject matter (description of the land)</li>
<li>Without these terms, the agreement for a lease will not be binding</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sale of land
<ul>
<li>Essential
<ul>
<li>the parties,</li>
<li>description of the land</li>
<li>and the price</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Non-essential:
<ul>
<li>Settlement date ‚Äî the court can imply a reasonable settlement date</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sale of goods
<ul>
<li>Essential:
<ul>
<li>the parties</li>
<li>and description of the goods</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Non-essential:
<ul>
<li>a failure to stipulate the price may not be fatal (s.13 Goods Act (NSW))</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What if one party has already performed all or part of the contract?
<ul>
<li>The courts are less likely to find an agreement is incomplete if one party has already performed all or some of the contract.</li>
<li>See the case of Foley v Classique Coaches Ltd (1934) 2 KB 1, which illustrates the court‚Äôs effort to find certain y in a case where there has been some performance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Foley v Classique Coaches Ltd (1934) 2 KB 1
<ul>
<li>Foley and Classique Coaches entered into a written agreement on the 11th April 1930, whereby it was agreed that Foley would sell some of his land to Classique for lbs 1,100.00 (Land Agreement)</li>
<li>This Land Agreement was made subject to a condition that the parties would enter into another contract, the Petrol Supply Agreement on the same day, with the following terms:
<ul>
<li>Foley would sell petrol to Classique at price to be agreed in writing from time to time</li>
<li>The Petrol Agreement was to remain in force during Foley‚Äôs life and his wife‚Äôs</li>
<li>Classique would not buy petrol from anyone else</li>
<li>If any dispute arose regarding the subject matter or construction of the Petrol Supply Agreement, the dispute shall be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Act 1889 (UK)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In accordance with the two Agreements, the land was transferred to Classique and they bought petrol from Foley for 3 years. Then Classique wanted to purchase cheaper petrol elsewhere</li>
<li>Held
<ul>
<li>There was an effective and enforceable contract, although no definite price had been agreed with regard to the future supply of petrol</li>
<li>Key distinction here is that the land had been conveyed and the parties were well into performance of the agreement.
<ul>
<li>3 years into agreement</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>May and Butcher v The King (1934) 2 KB 17
<ul>
<li>May and Butcher entered into a 12 month contract with the Disposals and Liquidation Commission whereby it was agreed that the Commission would sell Old tentage to May and Butcher but the price would be ‚Äúagreed upon from time to time‚Äù (an agreement to agree).
<ul>
<li>The relationship soured and the Commission did not want to continue with the arrangement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>HELD:
<ul>
<li>The price was an essential term and the agreement was void for want of certainty;
<ul>
<li>the parties had agreed to reach agreement on the price in the future, so for the court to imply a reasonable price would be inconsistent with the expressed intentions of the parties, which was to set the price themselves,</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>However, an agreement to agree on an essential term may be enforceable if:
<ul>
<li>The agreement has been partly performed: Foley v Classique Coaches.</li>
<li>A mechanism / formula is specified to supply a term if the parties are unable to reach agreement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Completeness: A mechanism or formula can fill the gap
<ul>
<li>Effective mechanism
<ul>
<li>Parties may make a valid contract that defers agreement on an essential term by providing an effective mechanism for supplying the term in the event they fail to reach agreement.</li>
<li>See eg, the case of George v Roach (1942) 67 CLR 253:
<ul>
<li>George carried on the business of a newsagent and storekeeper.
<ul>
<li>He agreed to sell his business to Spencer.</li>
<li>The contract provided that a valuation of the newspaper agency would be provided by a third party, Mr Solomon, and this valuation would form the basis of the purchase price.</li>
<li>Spencer paid lbs 1,100 on account of the purchase price even though the valuation for not yet taken place.</li>
<li>Mr Solomon refused to undertake the valuation.</li>
<li>Mr Spencer had died by then but his wife, Roach (on behalf of his estate to recover the lbs 1,100 because the contract was void for uncertainty.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The High Court held that an agreement was ineffective when part of the purchase price was to be fixed by a nominated valuer who refused to carry out the task.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Effective formula
<ul>
<li>An alternative is for the parties to agree on a formula for settling an essential term in the event of a dispute
<ul>
<li>(eg: a base sum and a mathematical formula that incorporates reference to changes in the Consumer Price Index to determine increases in rent each year).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The validity of such a contract will then depend on whether the court regards the formula or standard as sufficiently certain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Certainty
<ul>
<li>The main purpose of interpreting terms of a contract is to work out what exactly each party has to do to meet the obligations under it. Interpretation is not always easy</li>
<li>Consider the agreements below:
<ul>
<li>Parties enter into an agreement to build a rear decking. They agree that the ‚Äú‚Ä¶timber used in the must be of high quality‚Äù</li>
<li>Parties enter into an agreement to ‚Äúsupply Coles with fresh eggs‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What do these terms mean?</li>
<li>Court‚Äôs approach to a particular term that is vague or imprecise
<ul>
<li>Not a pedantic test ‚Äî some ambiguity is acceptable:
<ul>
<li>Council of the Upper Hunter v Aust Chilling and Freezing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Whether an objective standard (where available) can be relied on or implied to save a clause. Courts are often divided as to this approach
<ul>
<li>Biotechnology v Pace (Note: this case also raises issues of illusory promises)</li>
<li>Whitlock v Brew</li>
<li>Hall v Busst</li>
<li>Meehan v Jones</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Uncertainty of meaning is more likely to affect validity if the parties have yet to perform</li>
<li>Agreements to negotiate in good faith are not necessarily too uncertain:
<ul>
<li>United Group Rail v Rail Corp</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Certainty of meaning
<ul>
<li>Court‚Äôs approach to a term that is vague or imprecise
<ul>
<li>The terms must not be vague and imprecise such that the courts cannot attribute sufficiently precise meaning to them.</li>
<li>Courts do not usually take a narrow approach to the requirement of certainty, and will attribute a meaning to the language used by the parties unless it is impossible to do so.</li>
<li>As with incompleteness, uncertainty is more likely to affect a contract that remains wholly executory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Council of the Upper Hunter County District v Australian Chilling &amp; Freezing (1968) 118 CLR 429
<ul>
<li>The Council contracted to sell electricity to Australian Chilling and Freezing (‚ÄúACF‚Äù)</li>
<li>Clause 5 of the agreement provided as follows:
<ul>
<li>It is agreed that during the term of this agreement if the supplier‚Äôs [Council‚Äôs] costs shall vary in other respects than has been hereinbefore provided the supplier [Council] shall have the right to vary the maximum demand charge and the energy charge by notice in writing to the purchaser [ACF]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The agreement also provided for arbitration in the event of a dispute between the parties</li>
<li>Council sought to increase their charges pursuant to clause 5</li>
<li>ACF argued that clause 5, in particular its reference to supplier‚Äôs costs varying, was uncertain and unenforceable</li>
<li>language employed by parties was not ‚Äúso obscure and so incapable of any definite or precise meaning that the court is unable to attribute to the parties any particular contractual intention‚Äù, the contract cannot be held to be uncertain to be void or meaningless</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implying Objective Standards
<ul>
<li>Standards of reasonableness and fairness (and similar concepts) are sometimes employed as terms of a contract expressly by the parties or implied by the courts to make a contract complete. Parties might use terms such as:
<ul>
<li>‚Äúa reasonable price for the goods‚Äù</li>
<li>‚Äúa fair and equitable price for her services‚Äù</li>
<li>‚Äúprice to be set at fair market value‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>These concepts are inherently imprecise but the question is whether they are uncertain.</li>
<li>The courts will endeavour to give those terms meaning in order to uphold a contract.</li>
<li>In some cases, what is reasonable or fair will not be sufficiently certain because it may be impossible to work out what it means.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Whitlock v Brew (1968) 118 CLR 445
<ul>
<li>What are the facts?
<ul>
<li>The difficulty that the court had to deal with was what does the term ‚Äúupon such reasonable terms as commonly govern a lease‚Äù in clause 5 actually mean?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Kitto J held:
<ul>
<li>The expression ‚Äòupon such reasonable terms as commonly govern a lease would have been sufficiently certain had there been an ascertainable set of terms in common use</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The result was that there was no consensus between the parties about key terms, such as the term of the lease, the rent</li>
<li>The arbitration clause would assist if there was a dispute as to what terms are reasonable and common to such a lease if such terms actually existed</li>
<li>The arbitration clause did not authorise an arbitrator to force on the purchaser such terms that the arbitrator might think are reasonable and ought commonly govern such a lease because to do so would alter the contract</li>
<li>Court concluded that clause 5 had no contractual effect, which resulted in the whole contract being rendered void</li>

<li>Hall and Busst agreed that Hall would purchase Busst‚Äôs land and chattels on an island, known as Bedarra Island for ¬£3.157</li>
<li>The agreement provided that:
<ul>
<li>Hall could not re-sell the land without first obtaining Busst‚Äôs consent</li>
<li>Such consent would be obtained by Hall giving notice to Busst of her intention to resell the land and Busst would have the option of repurchasing</li>
<li>Clause 5 stated: ‚Äúthe purchase price shall be the sum of ¬£3.157 4s 0d to which shall be added the value of all additions and improvements to the said property since the date of purchase‚Ä¶and from which shall be subtracted the value of the deficiencies in chattel property and a reasonable sum to cover depreciation of all buildings and property on the land.‚Äù</li>
<li>Hall sold the land and chattels to a third party for ¬£8,500 without giving notice to Busst</li>
<li>Busst sued Hall for breach of contract. Hall argued that the price clause in the option was void for uncertainty</li>
<li>The High Court held that the option was not enforceable because the price was uncertain</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>‚Äúthe value of all additions and improvements‚Äù is not sufficiently certain to give rise to an enforceable contract because there could be no external standard of value of additions and improvements to the island. There was nothing to compare it to, no external standard</li>
<li>‚ÄúThe value of all deficiencies‚Äù was uncertain in the ascertainment of the price
<ul>
<li>No external standard to assess what ‚Äúdepreciation of all other buildings and other property on the land‚Äù meant</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Certainty &amp; Agreements to negotiate
<ul>
<li>Contracts sometimes contain clauses as follows:
<ul>
<li>Parties must ‚Äònegotiate in good faith‚Äô the precise terms of a more comprehensive joint venture agreement</li>
<li>Parties must ‚Äòundertake genuine and good faith negotiations with a view to resolving disputes‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Such concepts such as ‚Äònegotiation‚Äô, ‚Äòmediation‚Äô and ‚Äògood faith‚Äô are inherently subjective, but the issue is whether they are enforceable
<ul>
<li>UK: these agreements cannot be legally binding on the basis that they are too uncertain to enforce</li>
<li>Australia: courts have been a bit more flexible and have tried to give such agreements some meaning, but it depends on the precise terms used. The Court looks for a promise that is sufficiently clear</li>

<li>United Group Rail Services Ltd v Rail Corporation NSW (2009) 74 NSWLR 618
<ul>
<li>
<p>United Group and Rail Corp entered into a contract whereby it was agreed that</p>
<ul>
<li>United Group would design and build new rolling stock for Rail Corp,.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clause 35 of the contract provided a dispute resolution clause.</p>
<ul>
<li>Part of the clause provided that if the dispute is referred to a senior representative of each party, they must meet and undertaken genuine and good faith negotiations with a view to resolving the dispute or difference.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>United Group argued that this clause was too uncertain and was therefore void and unenforceable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Held:</p>
<ul>
<li>The court held that their task is to give effect to business contracts where there is a meaning capable of being ascribed to a word or term or phrase.</li>
<li>Genuineness and good faith are not empty obligations.</li>
<li>Resolving a dispute ‚Äòrequires an honest and genuine attempt to resolve differences by discussion, and if thought to be reasonable and appropriate, by compromise, in the context of showing a faithfulness and fidelity to the existing bargain</li>

<li>ILLUSORY PROMISES &amp; CONSEQUENCES OF UNCERTAINTY
<ul>
<li>Certainty &amp; Illusory promises
<ul>
<li>A contract will be illusory if a party gives an unfettered discretion as to performance of a promise
<ul>
<li>What does unfettered mean?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the legal status of an illusory promise?
<ul>
<li>Placer Developments Ltd v Commonwealth (1969) 121 CLR 353</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A term will not be illusory where:
<ul>
<li>A party is given a latitude of choice which does not amount to complete and unfettered discretion
<ul>
<li>See Meehan v Jones (1982) 149 CLR 571</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The discretion relates to the fulfilment of a condition upon which the performance of the contract depends (ie there is no discretion as to the performance of the contract once the condition is satisfied)
<ul>
<li>See Meehan v Jones (1982) 149 CLR 571</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The discretion is exercised by a third party

</ul>
</li>
<li>Legal status of an illusory promise
<ul>
<li>Recognised general principle
<ul>
<li>Placer Developments Ltd v Commonwealth (1969) 121 CLR 353, 356 (Kitto J):
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòWherever words which by themselves constitute a promise are accompanied by words showing that the promisor is to have a discretion or option as to whether he will carry out that which purports to be the promise, the result is that there is no contract on which an action can be brought at all.‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are two ways of conceptualising this:
<ul>
<li>No consideration: an illusory promise is no promise at all (recall Australian Woollen Mills case).</li>
<li>Incomplete contract: an essential term has been left to be determined by one party.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Placer Developments Ltd v Commonwealth (1969) 121 CLR 353
<ul>
<li>Clause 14 of the Agreement stated that if customs duty had to be paid on the imported products and not remitted, ‚Äúthe Commonwealth will pay to the Timber Company a subsidy upon the exportation of these products from the Territory ‚Ä¶ of an amount or at a rate determined by the Commonwealth from time to time but the amount of subsidy paid shall not exceed the amount of customs duty paid and not remitted‚Äù</li>
<li>Kitto J held:
<ul>
<li>In this case (with specific reference to clause 14), the Commonwealth‚Äôs promise to pay an unspecified sum of money was illusory, since the Commonwealth was expressly given a discretion to determine the amount to be paid.</li>
<li>A promise to pay a governmental subsidy is meaningless in the absence of a specification of some amount or some basis of calculation.
<ul>
<li>That promise carries no implication that at least a reasonable subsidy shall be paid, for there is no general standard of reasonableness with respect to the quantum of a subsidy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A term will not be illusory where:
<ul>
<li>A party is given a latitude of choice, which does not amount to complete and unfettered discretion</li>
<li>The discretion relates to the fulfilment of a condition upon which the performance of the contract depends, so there is no discretion as to the performance of the contract once the condition is satisfied</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Meehan v Jones (1982) 149 CLR 571
<ul>
<li>The parties entered into a written agreement for the sale of land (an oil refinery) for a price of $800,000.00</li>
<li>The contract was subject to two conditions:
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Purchaser or his nominee entering into a satisfactory Agreement or arrangement with Ampol Petroleum Limited for the supply of a satisfactory quantity of crude oil</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>Purchaser or his nominee receiving approval for finance on satisfactory terms and conditions in an amount sufficient to complete the purchase hereunder;</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>and should either of the above conditions not be satisfied on or before 31 July 1979 (or such extended time as the</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>parties may agree upon) then this Contract (other than for the provisions of this Clause) shall be null and void</li>
<li>On 23 July, Jones sold the land to a 3rd party</li>
<li>On 30 July, Meehan advised Jones that both conditions had been satisfied. Meehan sought specific performance of the contract</li>
<li>The trial judge and the Full Court of the Supreme Court refused specific performance on the basis that the contract was void for uncertainty.
<ul>
<li>Meehan then appealed to the High Court</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CERTAINTY in Meehan v Jones
<ul>
<li>Where the words of a condition state that a contract is subject to finance, the question immediately arises whether the test to be applied is a subjective or objective.</li>
<li>In either case, the purchaser does not have absolute discretion.</li>
<li>The fact that opinions may differ as to which of these two meanings is given to the words of the clause does not mean that the clause is uncertain.</li>
<li>In considering whether the objective / subjective approach applied, the court said that unless a clause of this kind makes a clear indication to the contrary, its natural effect is to leave it to the:
<ul>
<li>purchaser to be [subjectively] satisfied, not some hypothetical reasonable man.</li>
<li>it may be implied that the purchaser will act honestly in deciding whether or not he is satisfied.</li>
<li>but it is not necessary to imply that the purchase will make reasonable efforts to obtain finance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ILLUSORY PROMISE in Meehan v Jones
<ul>
<li>Although there is nothing uncertain about a clause which speaks of [subjective] satisfaction of purchase, could it still be illusory?</li>
<li>There is a well settled principle that when ‚Äúthe promisor is to have a discretion or option as to whether he will carry out that which purports to, be the promise, the result is that there is no contract‚Äù</li>
<li>A contract is illusory where one of the parties has a discretion as to whether to perform the contract, but not where one of the parties has a discretion in relation to the fulfilment of a condition on which the contract depends.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Meehan v Jones (1982) (cont‚Äôd)
<ul>
<li>To say that a ‚Äúsubject to finance‚Äù or ‚Äúsubject to finance on satisfactory terms and conditions‚Äù clause denotes finance which is satisfactory to the purchaser is not to say that he has an absolute or unfettered right to decide what is satisfactory.</li>
<li>With some justification the vendor can claim that the agreement is a binding contract which relieves the purchaser from performance only in the event that, acting honestly, or honestly and reasonably, he is unable to obtain suitable finance.</li>
<li>There is in this formulation no element of uncertainty - the courts are quite capable of deciding whether the purchaser is acting honestly and reasonably.</li>
<li>Because the purchaser must act honestly, or honestly and reasonably, it is not a case where the purchaser has an unfettered discretion as to what constitutes finance on satisfactory terms
<ul>
<li>‚Äì the decision must be reached honestly, or honestly and reasonably.</li>
<li>Just because there is some discretion, does not make it unfettered</li>
<li>In this case, it is a condition, not a term</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Accordingly, the promise is not illusory</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Godecke v Kirwan (1973) 129 CLR 629
<ul>
<li>The parties signed a document headed ‚ÄòOffer and Acceptance‚Äô setting out terms they agreed to for the sale and purchase of land. The agreement provided for a promise by the purchaser to execute, if required to do so, a further agreement in accordance with cl.6</li>
<li>Cl. 6 provided that if a formal agreement was required, it would be prepared by the vendor‚Äôs solicitors containing ‚Äúthe foregoing and such other covenants and conditions as they may reasonably require‚Äù</li>
<li>Kirwan refused to go ahead and transfer the land. He argued the agreement was illusory because they would be bound by the subsequent formal agreement drawn up by solicitors containing other terms and that conferred on them an unfettered discretion</li>
<li>Walsh J: the clause should be construed as limited to permitting the insertion of covenants and conditions not inconsistent with those contained in the offer. It was also limited by a standard of reasonableness, determined objectively so it did not confer an unfettered discretion on the solicitors</li>
<li>What did Gibbs J say?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Biotechnology Australia Pty Ltd v Pace (1988) 15 NSWLR 130 (Court of Appeal) - scheme one day‚Ä¶ somehow somewhere
<ul>
<li>Dr Pace was a scientist and he entered into an employment contract with a company called Biotechnology.</li>
<li>The contract provided that Dr Pace would receive a salary of $36,000 per annum, a company car and an option to participate in the Company‚Äôs senior staff equity sharing scheme.</li>
<li>Dr Pace was aware that at the time he accepted the offer of employment the Scheme didn‚Äôt exist but the company had plans to introduce it.
<ul>
<li>When his employment was terminated, he sued the company for damages for its failure to give him the option of participating in the equity sharing scheme.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Relevant issues before the Court:
<ul>
<li>Was the disputed clause so uncertain that it cannot be enforced?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Was the disputed clause so devoid of meaning and so dependent upon the initiatives and decision of Biotechnology Australia as to be illusory?</li>
<li>Kirby J - Uncertainty
<ul>
<li>Kirby J made some general observations about the task of courts in trying to resolve uncertainty in contracts.
<ul>
<li>Every case depends upon its own facts. The meaning of an agreement must be discovered objectively.
<ul>
<li>If there is ambiguity or vagueness, regard to extrinsic evidence might give meaning to the term</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Courts will try to uphold the agreements and avoid frustrating the wishes of the parties, but only so far as those wishes may be ascertained from the agreement between them</li>
<li>Courts will not uphold agreements where the court is asked to spell out to an unacceptable extent that which the parties have themselves failed to agree;
<ul>
<li>clarify that which is too obscure and accept for itself a discretion which the parties by their agreement reserved to one of both of them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Judges will differ in opinion about whether a court can give effect to an uncertain term and there is no objectively right decision in such cases.</li>
<li>The decisions are based on the features of the agreement, the relationship between the parties and relevant external reference points in order to resolve an uncertain term</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Application of legal principles to the facts
<ul>
<li>Was the disputed clause so uncertain of content that it could not be enforced?
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòIt was nonetheless void for uncertainty because the challenged term contained within it too many elements which are uncertain‚Ä¶the bare bones of the promise to establish such a scheme leave too mant decisions to be made for a court to attempt to give content to the promise by substituting its opinion of a fair scheme‚Ä¶</li>
<li>There are too many features of apparent peculiarity in which schemes ‚Ä¶
<ul>
<li>to make it safe to conclude that an objectively ascertainable external standard exists.‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The court found that there were too many elements which were uncertain such as:
<ul>
<li>How many shares in Biotech were to be devoted to the scheme?</li>
<li>What class of shares were to be held by the likes of Pace?</li>
<li>What were the terms of the options upon which the shares would issue?</li>
<li>What rights would attach to the shares?</li>
<li>Upon what terms were they acquired and could they be disposed of?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There were too many gaps to fill in which the parties themselves did not fill, and in this basis the term was unenforceable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Application of legal principles to the facts
<ul>
<li>Was the disputed clause so devoid of meaning and so dependent upon the initiatives and decisions of Biotechnology Australia as to be illusory?
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe problem for the court is that the term is just too uncertain of content.‚Äô</li>
<li>The ‚Äòfulfilment of the term relating to the equity sharing scheme depended upon the decision of one party, namely Biotechnology.</li>
<li>There was no external standard to fix an ‚Äúappropriate‚Äù or ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù equity participation scheme.‚Äô</li>
<li>The ‚Äòexistence of other schemes in other companies with other products and other scientists provides no such reference point‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Biotechnology Australia Pty Ltd v Pace (1988) 15 NSWLR 130 (Court of Appeal)
<ul>
<li>McHugh JA (applied similar reasoning to Kirby P):
<ul>
<li>The promise is too illusory or too vague and uncertain to be enforceable.</li>
<li>The parties recognised that Biotech would decide both the nature of the scheme and the rights of the individuals participating in it.</li>
<li>There is no standard by which a court could determine in any meaningful sense whether such a promise was broken.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hope JA (dissent):
<ul>
<li>Biotech was required to give Pace an option on terms which it had honestly arrived at.</li>
<li>The role of staff equity sharing schemes in employment contracts is sufficiently well established to enable courts to apply the concept of reasonableness to them.</li>
<li>The schemes are more complex than bonuses but that merely makes the resolution of the problem more difficult;
<ul>
<li>it does not deny the possibility of resolution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Concluded that the promise was valid - ‚Äô‚Ä¶ in my opinion the proper conclusion at this stage of the hearing is that as there was a valid and enforceable contractual promise on the part of Biotech to establish a senior staff equity sharing scheme and that the promise was not unenforceable for uncertainty or as being illusory‚Ä¶‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consequences of uncertainty
<ul>
<li>If the terms of an agreement are incomplete, uncertain or illusory, the consequences that can flow include:
<ul>
<li>The whole agreement is VOID
<ul>
<li>If the terms of an agreement are incomplete, uncertain or illusory, the courts look at how essential the term is and the intention of the parties in order to determine whether the entire agreement is void.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SEVERANCE ‚Äì the ineffective term can be severed from the rest of the agreement
<ul>
<li>The problematic term can be severed from the rest of the agreement, and the remaining terms are able to be performed and enforced.</li>
<li>The court will take into account the essentiality of the term and whether severing it is consistent with the intention of the parties.
<ul>
<li>If severing the clause changes the agreement into something the parties did not agree to, the court will not allow that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Eg: Whitlock v Brew: If the court had severed clause 5 of the contract, it would have turned the sale into something different from what the parties contemplated</li>

<li>Plant v Bourne [1897] 2 Ch 281
<ul>
<li>Description: ‚Äútwenty-four acres of land, freehold, and all appurtenances thereto, at Totmonslow, in the parish of Draycott, in the county of Stafford.‚Äù
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòI think Mr. Plant means he is selling ‚Äúthe twenty-four acres we have been looking at,‚Äù or ‚Äúmy twenty-four acres.‚Äù</li>
<li>It is not twenty-four acres of land anywhere in England, but the place, the county, and the parish are all mentioned. ‚Ä¶ Assuming that the parol evidence comes up to what has been stated, the result would be this: that Mr. Plant had twenty-four acres lying within the metes and bounds sufficiently defined; and if the fact be ascertained that he had no other twenty-four acres that would answer that description, then there would be simply the laying the contract alongside that fact, and the result will be ascertained ‚Äî namely, that the twenty-four acres lying within the metes and bounds was the property that was intended to be included in this description.‚Äô (Chitty J, 290)</li>

<ul>
<li>‚ÄòFinally, even if these objections are not properly founded, it will be seen upon examination that there are several reasons why the document could not be regarded as a sufficient note or memorandum.</li>
<li>In the first place it does not specify the property which is to be leased beyond describing it as ‚Äúpart of Lot B, Princes Highway, Sylvania Heights‚Äù.</li>

<li>Signature
<ul>
<li>‚ÄúSignature‚Äù is more than mark at the end of a document.</li>
<li>Courts look for an objective indication by the party to be charged that they acknowledge that a certain document(s) records the entire agreement and that they are bound by it.</li>

<li>‚Äù‚Ä¶ for the cases have decided that it does not signify where the name is placed, if it is put there by the party sought to be charged or some person deputed by him. It may be at the head, in the middle, at the end, or in any part of the document.‚Äù</li>

<li>‚ÄúThe principle applied in those cases can, we think, have no application to any document which is not in some way or other recognizable as a note or memorandum of a concluded agreement.‚Äù</li>
<li>Neither the existence of the document nor its contents are indicative of the existence of any binding contract.</li>
<li>Perhaps, in other words, it may be said that the enumerated particulars do not appear as a note or memorandum of a subsisting contract as distinct from bare instructions for the preparation of a formal lease.</li>

<ul>
<li>(1) For the purposes of a law of this jurisdiction, a transaction is not invalid because it took place wholly or partly by means of one or more electronic communications.</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Section 9 ‚Äì Signatures
<ul>
<li>(1) If, under a law of this jurisdiction, the signature of a person is required, that requirement is taken to have been met in relation to an electronic communication if:
<ul>
<li>(a) a method is used to identify the person and to indicate the person‚Äôs intention in respect of the information communicated, and</li>
<li>(b) the method used was either:
<ul>
<li>(i) as reliable as appropriate for the purpose for which the electronic communication was generated or communicated, in the light of all the circumstances, including any relevant agreement, or</li>
<li>(ii) proven in fact to have fulfilled the functions described in paragraph (a), by itself or together with further evidence, and (c) the person to whom the signature is required to be given consents to that requirement being met by way of the use of the method mentioned in paragraph (a).

</ul>
</li>
<li>Section 54A ‚Äì Contracts for sale etc of land to be in writing
<ul>

<li>Did not apply to this type or arrangement; and</li>
<li>Was only used when rent was overdue or in respect of objectionable advertising.</li>

<li>PAROL EVIDENCE RULE:Summarised
<ul>
<li>Masterton Homes Pty Ltd v Palm Assets Pty Ltd (2009) 261 ALR 382
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe principles that are applicable in deciding whether an agreement that parties have entered is one that is wholly in writing, or partly written and partly oral, include the following: ‚Ä¶ 401 [90] (Campbell JA)
<ul>
<li>‚Äò(1) When there is a document that on its face appears to be a complete contract, that provides an evidentiary basis for inferring that the document contains the whole of the express contractual terms that bind the parties: ‚Ä¶‚Äô 401 [90] (Campbell JA)</li>
<li>‚Äò(2) It is open to a party to prove that, even though there is a document that on its face appears to be a complete contract, the parties have agreed orally on terms additional to those contained in the writing: ‚Ä¶
<ul>
<li>Conversely, it is open to a party to prove that the parties have orally agreed that a document should contain the whole of the terms agreed between them: ‚Ä¶‚Äô 401 [90] (Campbell JA)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>‚Äò(3) The parol evidence rule applies only to contracts that are wholly in writing, and thus has no scope to operate until it has first been ascertained that the contract is wholly in writing: ‚Ä¶‚Äô 402 [90] (Campbell JA)</li>
<li>‚Äò(4) Where a contract is partly written and partly oral, the terms of the contract are to be ascertained from the whole of the circumstances as a matter of fact: ‚Ä¶‚Äô</li>
<li>‚Äò(5) In determining what are the terms of a contract that is partly written and partly oral, surrounding circumstances may be used as an aid to finding what the terms of the contract are:
<ul>
<li>‚Ä¶ If it is possible to make a finding about what were the words the parties said to each other, the meaning of those words is ascertained in the light of the surrounding circumstances: ‚Ä¶
If it is not possible to make a finding about the particular words that were used (as sometimes happens when a contract is partly written, partly oral and partly inferred from conduct) the surrounding circumstances can be looked at to find what in substance the parties agreed:‚Äô</li>

<li>Clause expressly excluded terms being implied into the agreement.</li>
<li>Ordinarily, the Sale of Goods Act would imply a warranty that the machine was fit for purpose.</li>

<li>Was cl 6 (exclusion clause) part of the contract?</li>

</li>
<li>Alphapharm argued:

<li>Toll had not brought the ‚Äòunusual‚Äô terms in it to its attention before signing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In this case:

<li>Terms were not unusual for the industry.</li>
<li>Signer was not rushed to Sign.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Test
<ul>
<li>Ordinary Meaning: The words used in a contract should be given their natural and ordinary meaning unless such a reading would lead to an absurd result.</li>
<li>Context is Key: The context in which a term is used within the contract and the overall purpose of the contract play a significant role in its interpretation.</li>
<li>Commercial Sense: The interpretation should make commercial sense, especially when interpreting commercial contracts.</li>
<li>Avoiding Unreasonable Results: Interpretations that would lead to an unreasonable result, where the contract is fairly open to another interpretation, should be avoided.</li>

<li>In making factual findings of a term or terms of such a contract, the evidence of witnesses as to words written or spoken by the parties (and their knowledge of relevant matters at the time of the contract) must be weighed alongside the objective surrounding facts (which are undisputed or which are established by other objective evidence) and also with the apparent logic of events.‚Äô [46] (Gordon J)</li>

<li>Trust leased land to the Council to construct and operate an underground carpark for 50 years.</li>
<li>The Trustees could revise the rent every 3 years according to cl 4(b).</li>
<li>‚Äòadditional costs and expenses which they may incur in regard to the surface of the Domain above or in the vicinity of the parking station and the footway and which arise out of the construction operation and maintenance of the parking station by the Lessee.‚Äô</li>
<li>The Council argued that cl 4(b) exhaustively listed what the Trustees could consider when revising the rent.</li>
<li>High Court considered surrounding circumstances:
<ul>
<li>Legislative background that established the parties.</li>
<li>History of dealings up until lease executed in 1972.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>‚Äò(a) the parties to the transaction were two public authorities;</li>
<li>(b) the primary purpose of the transaction was to provide a public facility, not a profit;</li>
<li>(c) the lessee was responsible for the substantial cost of construction of the facility;</li>
<li>(d) the facility was to be constructed under the lessor‚Äôs land and would not interfere with the continued public enjoyment of that land for its primary object, recreation;</li>
<li>(e) the parties‚Äô concern was to protect the lessor from financial disadvantage from the transaction; and</li>
<li>(f) the only financial disadvantage to the lessor which the parties identified related to additional expense which it would or might incur immediately or in the future.‚Äô 53 [11]

<li>Facts
<ul>
<li>Delco retained Darlington to trade on the futures market on its behalf.</li>
<li>Written contract contained:</li>
<li>Exclusion clause</li>
<li>Limitation of liability clause.</li>
<li>Darlington five principles for exclusions
<ul>
<li>Natural and ordinary means</li>
<li>In light of the contract as a whole</li>
<li>Context of the market</li>
<li>Nature and object of the contract</li>
<li>Where appropriate use contra preferentum</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Clause 6 (Exclusion clause):</li>
<li>‚ÄòThe Client ‚Ä¶ acknowledges that the Agent will not be responsible for any loss arising in any way out of any trading activity undertaken on behalf of the Client whether pursuant to this Agreement or not</li>
<li>Clause 7(c) (Limitation clause):</li>
<li>‚ÄòAny liability on the Agent‚Äôs part ‚Ä¶ for damages for or in respect of any claim arising out of or in connection with the relationship established by this agreement or any conduct under it or any orders or instructions given to the Agent by the Client ‚Ä¶ shall not in any event (and whether or not such liability results from or involves negligence) exceed one hundred dollars.‚Äô</li>
<li>Delco authorised Darlington to enter ‚Äòday trading‚Äô transactions, that should have been ‚Äòclosed out‚Äô within 24-hour of entering them.</li>
<li>Darlington breached the contract by not closing out certain transactions within 24 hours.</li>
<li>Caused Delco loss of $280,000.</li>
<li>Darlington relied on Cl 6 and 7(c) to exclude/limit liability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Clause 6 (Exclusion clause) did not totally exclude liability.</li>
<li>‚ÄòThe Client ‚Ä¶ acknowledges that the Agent will not be responsible for any loss arising in any way out of any trading activity undertaken on behalf of the Client whether pursuant to this Agreement or not .</li>
<li>Clause 7(c) (Limitation clause) did limit liability.</li>
<li>‚ÄòAny liability on the Agent‚Äôs part ‚Ä¶ for damages for or in respect of any claim arising out of or in connection with the relationship established by this agreement or any conduct under it or any orders or instructions given to the Agent by the Client ‚Ä¶ shall not in any event (and whether or not such liability results from or involves negligence) exceed one hundred dollars.‚Äô</li>
<li>Interpretation
<ul>
<li>Natural and Ordinary Meaning: Both the sign and the ticket seem to exclude liability quite broadly. The wording covers damages, losses, or injuries and doesn‚Äôt limit the scope of incidents from which the car park seeks to exclude its liability.</li>
<li>Contra Proferentem: If any ambiguity were found in the clauses, the interpretation should not favor Lodge Carpark.</li>
<li>The court accepted that this clause effectively limited Darlington‚Äôs liability.
<ul>
<li>This meant that any potential damages payable by Darlington to Delco would be capped at <span class="katex"><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord">100</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">e</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">v</span><span class="mord mathnormal">e</span><span class="mord mathnormal">n</span><span class="mord mathnormal">t</span><span class="mord mathnormal">h</span><span class="mord mathnormal">o</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">ug</span><span class="mord mathnormal">h</span><span class="mord mathnormal">t</span><span class="mord mathnormal">h</span><span class="mord mathnormal">e</span><span class="mord mathnormal">a</span><span class="mord mathnormal">c</span><span class="mord mathnormal">t</span><span class="mord mathnormal">u</span><span class="mord mathnormal">a</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.01968em;">ll</span><span class="mord mathnormal">osss</span><span class="mord mathnormal">u</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.10764em;">ff</span><span class="mord mathnormal">ere</span><span class="mord mathnormal">d</span><span class="mord mathnormal">b</span><span class="mord mathnormal">yDe</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.01968em;">l</span><span class="mord mathnormal">co</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.02691em;">w</span><span class="mord mathnormal">a</span><span class="mord mathnormal">ss</span><span class="mord mathnormal">i</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">g</span><span class="mord mathnormal">ni</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.10764em;">f</span><span class="mord mathnormal">i</span><span class="mord mathnormal">c</span><span class="mord mathnormal">an</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.01968em;">tl</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">y</span><span class="mord mathnormal">m</span><span class="mord mathnormal">ore</span><span class="mopen">(</span></span></span></span>280,000).</li>

<li>West parked his car in a carpark operated by Sydney City Council.</li>

<li>‚ÄòSuch a clause contemplates that loss or damage may occur by reason of negligence ‚Ä¶ in carrying out the obligations created by the contract.

<ul>
<li>‚ÄòIf the happening of a stipulated event will always result in the defeat of the main object of the contract, there will be no scope for holding that that object requires the conclusion that the exempting clause is not applicable to that event.</li>
<li>But even in cases where the occurrence of the events stipulated in the exemption clause will not always defeat the main object of the contract, the nature of those events may nevertheless give rise to the inference that the clause was intended to apply to those events even when they occur in circumstances which defeat the main object of the contract.‚Äô 227</li>

<p>TL;DR</p>
<ul>
<li>Darlington is the leading modern authority on construing exclusion clauses.</li>
<li>Construe exclusion clauses using the ordinary principles of construction.</li>
<li>If the clause is ambiguous, then it may be construed contra proferentum.</li>

<p>Implied terms</p>
<ul>
<li>INTRODUCTION
<ul>
<li>Implied terms are as valid as express terms:</li>
<li>Damages can be awarded for breach.</li>
<li>Right to terminate may be conferred if the implied term is a condition.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hart v MacDonald (1910) 10 CLR 417
<ul>
<li>an implication is as much a part of a contract as any term couched in express words.‚Äô (430, Isaacs J)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Courts cautiously find implied terms as they do not want to rewrite the contract.</li>
<li>Exception: Legislation may provide that it cannot be contracted out of.</li>
<li>Servcorp WA Pty Ltd v Perron Investments Pty Ltd (2016) 50 WAR 226
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe requirement that an alleged implied term not ‚Äòcontradict‚Äô any express term plainly includes a direct contradiction.</li>
<li>However, the requirement has a broader connotation.</li>
<li>For example, a term cannot be implied if it is apparent, on the face of the document, that the parties adverted to the point in question and either deliberately rejected it or deliberately refrained from dealing with it.‚Äô (257, Buss</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hart v MacDonald (1910) 10 CLR 417
<ul>
<li>‚Äò[An entire agreement clause] excludes what is extraneous to the written contract: but it does not in terms exclude implications arising on a fair construction of the agreement itself, and in the absence of definite exclusion, an implication is as much a part of a contract as any term couched in express words.‚Äô (430, Isaacs J)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the court will not find the implied term then there is a gap in the contract.
<ul>
<li>One party will likely wear the loss / inconvenience.</li>
<li>Contract may fail:
<ul>
<li>Uncertain / incomplete</li>
<li>Frustrated.</li>

<li>INTRO
<ul>
<li>Leading case: BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings (1977) 180 CLR 266.</li>
<li>5 criteria aid in identifying implied terms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>NATURE
<ul>
<li>Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of NSW(1982) 149 CLR 337</li>
<li>with implication the term is one which it is presumed that the parties would have agreed upon had they turned their minds to it ‚Äî it is not a term that they have actually agreed upon.‚Äô 346 (Mason J)</li>
<li>Finding implied terms risks making a court an author.</li>
<li>The court mitigates this risk by:
<ul>
<li>Viewing implication of terms as part of the process of construction (ie, discerning the parties‚Äô intentions from express terms.)</li>
<li>Imposing high barriers to the implication of terms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>NECESSARY FOR BUSINESS EFFICACY
<ul>
<li>The Moorcock (1889) 14 PD 64
<ul>
<li>Plaintiff shipowner moored at a jetty of defendant wharf-owner.</li>
<li>Both parties knew that the ship would rest on Thames riverbed at low tide.
<ul>
<li>Ship was damaged when it rested on hard ridge in the riverbed.</li>
<li>Plaintiff argued that there was an implied term that the ship could safely moor at the jetty at low tide.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Both parties knew that the ship would rest on the riverbed at low tide.</li>
<li>It was obvious that no shipowner would moor at an unsafe jetty.
<ul>
<li>Only the defendants could discover whether the riverbed was safe and take steps to make it safe.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Therefore, they impliedly promised either that:
<ul>
<li>It was safe to moor at the jetty; or</li>
<li>That they would warn the plaintiff if it was not safe.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Sekisui Rib Loc Australia Pty Ltd v Rocla Pty Ltd (2012) 291 ALR 140
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe necessity to give ‚Äúbusiness efficacy‚Äù contemplates a term needed ‚Äúin order to make the agreement work, or conversely, in order to avoid an unworkable situation‚Äù.</li>
<li>This is a consideration of what would make the contract workable in a business sense.

<li>REASONABLE AND EQUITABLE
<ul>
<li>BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings (1977) 180 CLR 266
<ul>
<li>BP (Westernport) entered a rate agreement with the Shire of Hastings for the construction and operation of a refinery in the local government area.</li>
<li>The agreement required significant capital investment by BP (Westernport) and performance of obligations for at least 20 years.
<ul>
<li>The Council promised reduced rates for at least 40 years.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After a few years, BP (Westernport) was wound up.
<ul>
<li>Another company in the BP group assumed control of the refinery.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Council levied the new BP company with full rates.
<ul>
<li>Council argued that the rates agreement contained an implied term that the contract would terminate if BP (Westernport) ceased occupying the refinery.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The term was not reasonable and equitable:
<ul>
<li>Council had enjoyed significant economic benefits from the development of the refinery.</li>
<li>Council induced the BP group to invest based on the promised 40-year rate reduction.</li>
<li>Foreseeable that the BP group might restructure in that period.</li>
<li>It made no difference to the Council which of the group operated the refinery.</li>

<li>OBVIOUSNESS AND CLARITY
<ul>
<li>Shirlaw v Southern Foundries (1926) Ltd [1939] 2 KB 206
<ul>
<li>Prima facie that which in any contract is left to be implied and need not be expressed is something so obvious that it goes without saying;
<ul>
<li>so that, if while the parties were making their bargain, an officious bystander were to suggest some express provision for it in the agreement, they would testily suppress him with a common, ‚ÄòOh, of course‚Äô.‚Äô 227 (MacKinnon LJ)</li>

</li>
<li>CLARITY
<ul>
<li>Servcorp WA Pty Ltd v Perron Investments Pty Ltd (2016) 50 WAR 226
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe requirement that an alleged implied term be capable of clear expression overlaps with the requirement of obviousness.</li>

<p>Terms implied in fact: Formal and informal contracts</p>
<ul>
<li>FORMAL CONTRACTS
<ul>
<li>Detailed written agreements that appear exhaustive.</li>
<li>Often the result of negotiations and careful consideration of wording.</li>
<li>Often drafted by lawyers.</li>
<li>Often contain entire agreement clauses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings (1977) 180 CLR 266
<ul>
<li>for a term to be implied, the following conditions (which may overlap) must be satisfied (BP Refinery Test loosley):</li>
<li>Implied term interpretation construction loosley:</li>
<li>Formal term interpretation construction strictly:
<ul>
<li>(1) it must be reasonable and equitable;</li>
<li>(2) it must be necessary to give business efficacy (got to make it work) to the contract, so that no term will be implied if the contract is effective without it;</li>
<li>(3) it must be so obvious that ‚Äúit goes without saying‚Äù;</li>
<li>(4) it must be capable of clear expression;</li>
<li>(5) it must not contradict any express term of the contract.‚Äô 282-3 (Lord Simon of Glaisdale for the majority)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Apply the BP Refinery test (all 5 conditions) when implying a term into a formal contract.</li>
<li>The conditions overlap ‚Äî you may find that you repeat arguments to prove several of them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>INFORMAL AGREEMENTS
<ul>
<li>Often oral / made in informal circumstances.

<li>Hawkins v Clayton (1988) 164 CLR 539
<ul>
<li>(Subject to Realestate.com.au Pty Ltd v Hardingham [2022] HCA 39.)</li>
<li>January 1970: Ms Brasier executed a will appointing Mr Hawkins as executor and residual beneficiary.</li>
<li>Ms Brasier‚Äôs solicitor was Clayton Utz.
<ul>
<li>January 1975: Ms Brasier died.</li>
<li>Clayton Utz didn‚Äôt attempt to find Mr Hawkins until March 1981.</li>
<li>House had degraded and estate was fined for late lodgement of death duty.</li>
<li>Therefore the value of residuary estate was reduced.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mr Hawkins (for the Estate) argued that Clayton Utz had breached an implied term of Ms Brasier‚Äôs retainer contract with the firm imposing a duty to take reasonable care and locate the executor after her death.</li>
<li>Terms inferred based on ‚Äòactual‚Äô intention:
<ul>
<li>Will would be kept safe until Ms Brasier‚Äôs death.</li>
<li>Ms Brasier could request it be delivered to her at any time before her death.</li>

<ul>
<li>Hardingham: Sub-licence granted by REMA to the agencies permitted them to use the works only to market the relevant properties.</li>
<li>Therefore, Realestate and RP had breached copyright by continuing to use the works.</li>
<li>Contracts between REMA and the agencies were informal oral contracts.</li>
<li>No express terms on the scope of the sub-licence.</li>
<li>Was the limit on the sub-licences an implied term of these contracts?</li>
<li>REMA aware that:
<ul>
<li>The agencies needed to upload the Works to Realestate.com.au to properly market the properties.</li>
<li>Realestate.com.au required a licence be granted to use the Works as it saw fit, including sub-licencing the works to third parties.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>What to do post-Rea/estate.com.au?

<li>Con-Stan Industries of Australia Pty Ltd v Norwich Winterthur Insurance (Australia) Ltd (1986) 160 CLR 226
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThere must be evidence that the custom relied on is so well known and acquiesced in that everyone making a contract in that situation can reasonably be presumed to have imported that term into the contract.‚Äô (236, The Court)</li>
<li>Con-Stan entered an insurance contract with Norwich.
<ul>
<li>Con-Stan paid premiums to a third-party broker operating on behalf of Norwich, which were never passed onto Norwich.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Norwich sued Con-Stan for the unreceived premiums.
<ul>
<li>Con-Stan argued that the insurance contract contained a term implied by trade custom that an insurer could only claim remiums from the broker.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Topic 4.3 Terms implied by law (Not assessed)
<ul>
<li>The final basis for implication of terms is when the law itself implies terms into certain classes of contract. The law can imply terms in two ways
<ul>
<li>First, the common law can imply terms, provided that the implied terms are not inconsistent with the express terms.</li>
<li>Second - and perhaps more commonly these days - legislation can imply terms into contract. Terms implied by legislation often cannot be contracted out of.</li>
<li>doThird, and perhaps most commonly, they can be implied based upon the presumed intention of the parties as evidenced in the express terms.</li>

<li>By agreement</li>
<li>Because of breach or repudiation</li>

<ul>
<li>Printing and Numerical Registering Co v Sampson (1875) LR 19 Eq 462</li>
<li>INTRODUCTION
<ul>
<li>Termination by agreement rests on mutual consent.</li>
<li>Termination for breach/repudiation: unilateral act of one party in response to failure to perform by the other.</li>
<li>Frustration: automatic termination by the law in response to a frustrating event.</li>
<li>Termination by agreement can be achieved by:
<ul>
<li>Power granted by a term in the contract.</li>
<li>Expressly or impliedly agreeing to end a contract by entering into another contract.</li>
<li>A contract may also be varied by entering a further agreement.</li>

<li>TERMINATION BY CONTRACTUAL TERM
<ul>
<li>EXPRESS POWER
<ul>
<li>Parties can agree to terms conferring a power to terminate.
<ul>
<li>At will: Contract is immediately terminable at any time.</li>
<li>With notice: A party provides notice and the contract expires after the agreed notice period. (Eg, employment contracts)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CONTINGENT CONDITIONS

<li>Terms that either automatically terminate ‚Äî or give the parties the right to terminate ‚Äî if an identified event does / does not occur.</li>
<li>New Zealand Shipping Co Ltd v Soci√©t√© des Ateliers et Chantiers de France [1919] AC 1
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòIt is undoubtedly competent for the two parties to a contract to stipulate by a clause in it that the contract shall be void upon the happening of an event over which neither of the parties shall have any control, cannot bring about, prevent or retard.</li>
<li>For instance, they may stipulate that if rain should fall on the thirtieth day after the date of the contract, the contract should be void.</li>
<li>Then if rain did fall on that day the contract would be put to an end by this event, whether the parties so desire or not.‚Äô (9, Lord Atkinson)</li>

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<ul>
<li>BREACH
<ul>
<li>Breach = Failure to properly perform when required.</li>
<li>‚ÄòActual‚Äô breach requires:</li>
<li>Identification of relevant express or implied term(s) imposing obligation(s).</li>
<li>Construction of relevant term(s) to determine what is required.</li>
<li>Failure to properly perform when required.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>TOTAL / PARTIAL BREACH
<ul>
<li>Not necessary to classify a breach as ‚Äòtotal‚Äô or ‚Äòpartial‚Äô.</li>
<li>Relevant issue is whether it a term is breached at all.</li>
<li>Consequences of breach may be relevant if the term is classed as ‚Äòintermediate‚Äô.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>ANTICIPATORY BREACH</p>
<ul>
<li>Where a party by words or conduct indicates either:
<ul>
<li>an intention not to perform or</li>
<li>a complete incapacity to perform</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>a promise before that performance falls due.</li>
<li>Foran v Wight (1989) 168 CLR 385
<ul>
<li>‚Äô‚Ä¶ an announcement by the promisor before the time for performance arrives that he will not perform the promise is an anticipatory breach ‚Ä¶ .‚Äô 416 (Brennan J)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>TRIPARTITE CLASSIFICATION OF TERMS</p>
<ul>
<li>Conditions definition
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòEssential‚Äô terms</li>
<li>Any breach allows termination</li>
<li>Damages available</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Intermediate definition
<ul>
<li>Serious breach allows termination</li>
<li>No termination for trivial breach</li>
<li>Damages available</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Warranty definition
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòInessential‚Äô terms</li>
<li>No termination for breach</li>
<li>Damages available</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A terminable breach does not automatically terminate the contract.</li>
<li>Innocent party may choose to:</li>
<li>Terminate; or</li>
<li>Affirm the contract.</li>
<li>Process of choosing = ‚Äòelection‚Äô.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Principal points to note</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether an innocent party has a right to terminate depends upon the classification of the term.</li>
<li>If they have the right, then they may choose to terminate or affirm (See: Election)</li>
<li>Other remedies (like damages) may be cumulative with the right to terminate</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>MODIFYING THE COMMON LAW RIGHT TO TERMINATE</p>
<ul>
<li>Parties may agree to modify the common law rights to terminate for breach.
<ul>
<li>For example:</li>
<li>Allow termination for any breach of any type of term.</li>
<li>Impose a procedure on how to terminate.</li>

<ul>
<li>TEST OF ESSENTIALITY
<ul>
<li>‚ÄùThe test of essentiality is whether it appears from the general nature of the contract considered as a whole, or from some particular term or terms, that the promise is of such importance to the promisee that he would not have entered into the contract unless he had been assured of a strict ‚Ä¶ performance of the promise ‚Ä¶ and that this ought to have been apparent to the promisor.‚Äô 641-2</li>

<li>Tramways Advertising Pty Ltd v Luna Park (NSW) Ltd (1938) 38 SR (NSW) 632
<ul>
<li>Condition definition:
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòIn some cases it is expressly provided that a particular promise is essential to the contract, for example, by a stipulation that it is the basis or of the essence of the contract (Bettini v Gye (1876) 1 QBD 183 at 187) ‚Ä¶ ‚Äô 642 (Jordan CJ)</li>

<li>Tramways Advertising Pty Ltd v Luna Park (NSW) Ltd (1938) 38 SR (NSW) 632
<ul>
<li>‚Äô‚Ä¶ but in the absence of express provision the question is one of construction for the court, when once the terms of contract have been ascertained: Bentsen v Taylor Sons &amp; Co (No 2) [1893] 2 QB 274</li>

<li>Term‚Äôs function in the contract as a whole.</li>
<li>Nature of the contract.</li>
<li>Objective of the contract.</li>

<ul>
<li>Koompahtoo Local Aboriginal Land Council v Sanpine Pty Ltd (2007) 233 CLR 115

<li>CASE EXAMPLES
<ul>
<li>Luna Park (NSW) Ltd v Tramways Advertising Pty Ltd (1938) 61 CLR 286
<ul>
<li>Tramways promised to display boards on trams advertising Luna Park.</li>
<li>‚ÄòWe guarantee that these boards will be on the tracks at least eight hours per day throughout your season.‚Äô</li>
<li>Tramways displayed the boards for an average of 8 hours a day over the season.</li>
<li>NSW District Court: Tramways breached the term by not displaying all boards for a minimum of 8 hours a day, every day.</li>
<li>High Court: Was the term a condition?</li>
<li>The term was a condition:</li>
<li>Strong language: ‚Äòwe guarantee ‚Ä¶‚Äô</li>
<li>Luna Park obligated to pay only after Tramways had provided the service.</li>
<li>Surrounding circumstances: Luna Park had emphasised the continuous exposure during negotiations.</li>
<li>Associated Newspapers Ltd v Bancks (1951) 83 CLR 322
<ul>
<li>Associated Newspapers employed Bancks to produce weekly comics for 10 years.</li>
<li>Associated promised to publish Bancks‚Äô comics on the first page of the comics section of the ‚ÄòSunday Sun and Guardian‚Äô.</li>
<li>For 3 weeks In 1951, Associated published Bancks‚Äô comic on the third page of the comics section.</li>
<li>Bancks terminated the contract for Associated‚Äôs breach.</li>
<li>Was the term a condition?</li>
<li>The term was a condition:
<ul>
<li>The parties‚Äô mutual promises were ‚Äòconcurrent and corelative‚Äô. ie. the principal reasons why both parties entered the contract.</li>
<li>Continuous, prominent exposure was important to Bancks ‚Äì he would not have entered the contract unless Associated strictly performed its promise</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Tramways Advertising Pty Ltd v Luna Park (NSW) Ltd (1938) 38 SR (NSW) 632
<ul>
<li>The question whether a term in a contract is a condition or a warranty, that is, an essential or a non- essential promise, depends upon the intention of the parties as appearing in or from the contract.‚Äô 642 (Jordan CJ)</li>
<li>Parties may expressly designate a term as a warranty.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No recognised test for a warranty.
<ul>
<li>Historically, if a term was not a condition, then it was a warranty.</li>

<li>Hongkong Fir Shipping Co Ltd v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd (The Hongkong Fir) [1962] 2 QB 26
<ul>
<li>Hongkong Fir Shipping (‚ÄòHongkong‚Äô) owned a ship called ‚ÄòThe Hongkong Fir‚Äô.</li>
<li>Hongkong chartered the ship to Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd (‚ÄòKawasaki‚Äô).</li>
<li>Hongkong promised that:
<ul>
<li>The ship was ‚Äòin every way fitted for ordinary cargo service.‚Äô</li>
<li>They would maintain the ship in ‚Äòa thoroughly efficient state in hull and machinery during service‚Äô.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The ship was not well-maintained.
<ul>
<li>Kawasaki terminated the charter, alleging that Hongkong had breached it by not providing a seaworthy ship.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hongkong counter-sued for damages.</li>
<li>Trial judge found that Hongkong had breached the charter.
<ul>
<li>Did the breach give Kawasaki the right to terminate the charter?</li>

<li>manage the development project.</li>
<li>‚Äòkeep proper books, maintain all records and documents, and prepare all tax returns of the joint venture.‚Äô</li>
<li>Cl 16.5(a): ‚ÄòSanpine shall ensure that proper Books are kept so as to permit the affairs of the Joint Venture to be duly assessed.</li>
<li>Financial records comprised in the Books shall be kept in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and in such a manner as enables the Venturers to extract from the Books any information in relation to the affairs of the Joint Venture as that Venturer may reasonably require from time to time.</li>

<ul>
<li>

<li>When contract was signed, DTR had submitted a plan different to the plan attached to the contract.</li>

<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>DTR‚Äôs erroneous belief that it could register the plan in 2 stages was a repudiation of the contract.</li>

<li>GOOD SUMMARY
<ul>
<li>A good summary of the principles can be found in Velik v Steingold [2013] NSWCA 303, [86]</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ANTICIPATORY BREACH
<ul>
<li>Where a party by words or conduct indicates either:
<ul>
<li>an intention not to perform or</li>
<li>a complete incapacity to perform</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A promise before that performance falls due.</li>
<li>Foran v Wight (1989) 168 CLR 385
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòWhen a promise is an essential term of a contract, an announcement by the promisor before the time for performance arrives that he will not perform the promise is an anticipatory breach amounting to a repudiation of the contract conferring on the promisee a right to [terminate] the contract.‚Äô (416, Brennan J)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Allows a party to terminate immediately on notice that an essential promise will not be performed ‚Äì Innocent party does not have to wait until breach has occurred.</li>
<li>Or innocent party can choose to wait and see.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>TWO FORMS
<ul>
<li>Express anticipatory breach</li>
<li>Implied anticipatory breach</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>EXPRESS ANTICIPATORY BREACH
<ul>
<li>Foran v Wight (1989) 168 CLR 385
<ul>
<li>The Wights agreed to sell land to the Forans.</li>
<li>Date of settlement was an essential term.</li>
<li>Wights telephoned 2 days before settlement to advise that they would not be able to settle.</li>
<li>Neither party attempted settlement.</li>
<li>Forans terminated the contract 2 days after settlement date.</li>
<li>The breach was then anticipatory because it amounted to a refusal by the vendors to perform an essential term of the contract before the time for performance had arrived.‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>IMPLIED ANTICIPATORY BREACH
<ul>
<li>Where the defaulting party‚Äôs conduct or other circumstances make it clear to the innocent party that the defaulting party will not perform an essential obligation when it is due.</li>
<li>Also known as factual inability or factual impossibility.</li>
<li>Universal Cargo Carriers Corp v Citati [1957] 2 QB 401
<ul>
<li>Universal agree to transport Citati‚Äôs cargo from Basrah to Buenos Aires.</li>
<li>Citati did not have cargo available for loading 3 days before Universal‚Äôs ship was due to depart.</li>
<li>Universal departed ‚Äì argued that Citati had impliedly committed an anticipatory breach because cargo was not available with enough time to load.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An anticipatory breach must be proved in fact and not in supposition.‚Äô
<ul>
<li>if Mr. Roskill can produce out of the award a finding, that on July 18 the charterer was unable to load a cargo within such a time as would not have frustrated the object of the venture, the owners would be entitled to succeed.‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>IMPLIED ANTICIPATORY BREACH
<ul>
<li>Terminating because of an implied anticipatory breach is risky because the innocent party must prove the factual impossibility.
<ul>
<li>If the anticipatory breach is express, the innocent party may act on the express statement without more.</li>

<li>SUMMARY
<ul>
<li>Shevill v Builders Licensing Board (1982) 146 CLR 620
<ul>
<li>‚Äò[A valid contract] may be repudiated if one party renounces his liabilities under it ‚Äì if he evinces an intention no longer to be bound by the contract ‚Ä¶ or shows that he intends to fullfil the contract only in a manner substantially inconsistent with his obligations and not in any other way ‚Ä¶ . In such a case the innocent party is entitled to accept the repudiation, thereby discharging himself from further performance, and sue for damages.‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Repudiation def
<ul>
<li>Repudiation of a contract occurs when one party to the contract demonstrates that it is unwilling or unable to fulfill its obligations under that contract.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Repudiation test
<ul>
<li>The test is whether the party‚Äôs conduct would convey to a reasonable person, in the position of the other contracting party, renunciation of the contract as a whole (ie. an unwillingness or inability to perform all of that party‚Äôs obligations) or of a fundamental obligation under it.
<ul>
<li>A sufficiently serious failure to perform obligations that are not fundamental may also show an unwillingness or an inability to substantially perform the contract according to its requirements (Koompahtoo).</li>

<li>Topic 5.5 Discharge by frustration
<ul>
<li>DEFINITION
<ul>
<li>National Carriers Ltd v Panalpina (Northern) Ltd [1981] AC 675
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòFrustration of a contract takes place when there supervenes an event (without default of either party) and for which the contract makes no sufficient provision) which so significantly changes the nature (not merely the expense or onerousness) of the outstanding contractual rights and/or obligations from what the parties could reasonably have contemplated</li>
<li>The law declares both parties to be discharged from further performance.‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>NATURE OF CONTRACTUAL PROMISES
<ul>
<li>Paradine v Jane (1646) Aleyn 26
<ul>
<li>when the party by his own contract creates a duty or charge upon himself, he is bound to make it good, if he may, notwithstanding any accident by inevitable necessity, because he might have provided against it by his contract.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>‚ÄòAbsolute contract‚Äô rule.</li>
<li>To avoid liability for failure to perform:
<ul>
<li>Do not make absolute promises.</li>
<li>Include an exclusion clause.</li>
<li>Include a force majeure clause.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Taylor v Caldwell (1863) 122 ER 309
<ul>
<li>where, from the nature of the contract, it appears that the parties must from the beginning have known that it could not be fulfilled unless when the time for the fulfilment of the contract arrived some particular specified thing continued to exist, so that, when entering into the contract, they must have contemplated such continuing existence as the foundation of what was to be done</li>

</li>
<li>ROLE OF THE CONTRACT
<ul>
<li>Davis Contractors Ltd v Fareham Urban District Council [1956] AC 696
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe question is whether the contract which they did make is, on its true construction, wide enough to apply to the new situation: if it is not, then it is at an end.‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Relevant questions:
<ul>
<li>What was the purpose/foundation of the contract?</li>
<li>What did the parties promise to do?</li>
<li>Does the contract account for the supervening event?</li>
<li>What was the impact of the supervening event on the contract?</li>

<li>Relevant question: what is the effect of the supervening event?</li>
<li>The supervening event must radically impact performance for both parties.</li>

<li>Codelfa argued that the injunctions frustrated the contract.</li>
<li>‚ÄòThe critical issue then is whether the situation resulting from the grant of the injunction is fundamentally different from the situation contemplated by the contract on its true construction in the light of the surrounding circumstances.‚Äô (360, Mason J (Stephen J agreeing)).</li>
<li>‚ÄòThe answer must, I think, be in the affirmative. ‚Ä¶</li>

</li>
<li>[74] In the case of foreseeable but unforeseen events, the nature and extent of foreseeability is critical.

<li>‚ÄòIn the present case ‚Ä¶ the material facts of the transaction, the knowledge of the parties respectively, and their relative positions, the words of representation used, and the actual condition of the subject-matter spoken of, are relevant to the two inquiries necessary to be made:
<ul>

<li>Was it true?‚Äô (183, Privy Council)</li>

</li>
<li>the defendants were not justified in regarding anything said by the plaintiff as to the carrying capacity as being anything more than an expression of his opinion on the subject.</li>

<li>Smith v Land &amp; House Property Corp (1884) 28 Ch D 7
<ul>
<li>Owner of hotel represented to a potential purchaser that the current tenant was ‚Äòmost desirable tenant‚Äô.</li>
<li>In fact, the tenant irregularly paid rent.</li>
<li>The purchaser agreed to buy the hotel.</li>
<li>The tenant went bankrupt before settlement.</li>
<li>The purchaser submitted that ‚Äòmost desirable tenant‚Äô was a misrepresentation.</li>
<li>The owner submitted that the statement was an opinion
<ul>
<li>But if the facts are not equally well known to both sides, then a statement of opinion by one who knows the facts best involves very often a statement of a material fact, for he impliedly states that he knows facts which justify his opinion.‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>amounts at least to an assertion that nothing has occurred in the relations between the landlords and the tenant which can be considered to make the tenant an unsatisfactory one</li>

<li>‚ÄòFrom Blyth‚Äôs own evidence, therefore, it is plain that what he relied upon was not the representation that there was no power of suspension in the rules, but the assurance that that power would not be put in force.</li>

<li>David Securities Pty Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (1992) 175 CLR 353
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe identification and acceptance of such a narrow principle is strongly supported by the difficulty and illogicality of seeking to draw a rigid distinction between cases of mistake of law and mistake of fact.

<li>‚ÄòThe general rule, both of law and equity, in respect to concealment, is that mere silence with regard to a material fact, which there is no legal obligation to divulge, will not avoid a contract, although it operate as an injury to the party from whom it is concealed.</li>

<li>The purchaser, therefore, would be led to suppose, as to these farms, that he was purchasing with continuing tenancies at fixed rents, whereas he would, in fact, have to find tenants immediately after the completion of his purchase.‚Äô (Sir GJ Turner LJ)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Changed circumstances
<ul>
<li>A representation that is true at the time it is made, but which becomes untrue by the time the contract is formed, is a misrepresentation.</li>
<li>Eg: a statement of fact which becomes false; a statement of intent to do something which changes.</li>
<li>If the defendant becomes aware that the representation has become untrue before the contract is formed they must inform the plaintiff.</li>
<li>The law allows a plaintiff to assume that representations made by a defendant are true up until the contract is formed.</li>

</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>If a material representation is made which is calculated to induce the plaintiff to enter into a contract and that person in fact enters into a contract there arises a fair inference of fact that he or she was induced to do so by the representation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="3">
<li>The inference may be rebutted, for example, by showing that the plaintiff, before he or she entered into the contract, either was possessed of actual knowledge or the true facts and knew them to be true or alternatively made it plain that whether, he or she knew the true facts or not, he or she did not rely on the representation.</li>

<li>‚ÄòIN TRADE OR COMMERCE‚Äô
<ul>
<li>Concrete Constructions (NSW) Pty Ltd v Nelson (1990) 169 CLR 594
<ul>
<li>the conduct of a corporation towards persons‚Ä¶ with whomit it‚Ä¶ has or may have dealings in the course of those activities or transactions which, of their nature, bear a trading or commercial character.‚Äô</li>
<li>As a matter of language, a prohibition against engaging
<ul>
<li>in conduct ‚Äúin trade or commerce‚Äù can be construed as encompassing conduct in the course of the myriad of activities which are not, of their nature, of a trading or commercial character but which are undertaken in the course of, or as incidental to, the carrying on of an overall trading or commercial business.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>‚Äô ‚Ä¶it is plain that [s 18] was not intended to extend to all conduct, regardless of its nature, in which a corporation might engage inthe course of, or for the purposes of, its overall trading or commercial business.
<ul>
<li>activities or transactions which, of their nature, bear a trading or commercial character.</li>
<li>An internal communication by one employee to another employee in the course of their ordinary activities in and about the construction of a building.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Such conduct includes, of course, promotional activities in relation to, or for the purposes of, the supply of goods or services to actual or potential consumers, be they identified persons or merely an unidentifiable section of the public.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hearn v O‚ÄôRourke (2003) 129 FCR 63
<ul>
<li>[28] The following propositions emerge from the above extract [from Nelson]:
<ul>
<li>The phrase ‚Äúin trade or commerce‚Äù has a restrictive operation, in the sense that it narrows the operation of [s 18].</li>
<li>The phrase is capable of both a wider and a narrower interpretation.</li>
<li>The wider interpretation would include ‚Äù‚Ä¶ the myriad of activities which are not, of their nature, of a trading or commercial character but which are undertaken in the course of, or as incidental to, the carrying on of an overall trading or commercial business.‚Äù</li>
<li>Such an approach would impose an overlay of Commonwealth law upon any area in which a corporation might act in carrying on its trading or commercial activities. ‚Ä¶</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The second, and narrower construction is that [s 18] applies only to conduct ‚Äù‚Ä¶ which is itself an aspect or element of activities or transactions which, of their nature, bear a trading or commercial character.‚Äù
<ul>
<li>The narrower construction is correct.</li>
<li>The section is concerned with the conduct of a corporation towards persons with whom it has, or may have dealings in the course of its trading activities or transactions which dealings, of their nature, bear a trading or commercial character.</li>
<li>The dividing line between conduct which is in trade or commerce and conduct which is not may be unclear, in which case it may be necessary to identify the features which import a trading or commercial character to an activity which would not, without more, have that character.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The mere driving of a truck or construction of a building is not, without more, in trade or commerce.</li>
<li>To engage in conduct which is divorced from any relevant actual or potential trading or commercial relationship or dealing will not, of itself, constitute conduct ‚Äúin trade or commerce‚Äù for the purposes of the section. (Dowsett J)
<ul>
<li>The focus must be upon the conduct in question and not upon the range of activities in which a relevant corporation may be engaged.</li>
<li>In other words, one does not simply identify the conduct in question, note that the relevant corporation is engaged in commercial activity of some kind, then look for a connection between the two.
<ul>
<li>Because corporations are usually formed to engage in commercial activities, it will rarely be difficult to find such a connection.</li>
<li>The correct approach is to determine whether or not the relevant conduct can, according to ordinary usage, be described as having occurred in the course of dealings ‚Äú‚Ä¶which, of their nature, bear a trading or commercial character‚Äù.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ultimately a question of fact.</li>
<li>Note: only the defendant needs to be acting in trade or commerce: not the plaintiff.</li>
<li>Lubidineuse v Bevanere Pty Ltd (1984) 3 FCR 1
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòIn determining whether, in a particular case, that test is met it is relevant to consider inter alia the character of the parties involved ‚Äì which I assume to include whether they are people who have engaged, or are about to engage, in commercial activities ‚Äì whether the transaction is motivated by business, as distinct from personal, reasons and whether the person whose conduct is under attack played an active part in the transaction.‚Äô (12, Wilcox J)</li>

<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe sale of the clinic should not be viewed in isolation from the totality of the appellant‚Äôs commercial activities</li>
<li>The mere fact that it was the sale of a capital asset did not deprive it of its character as a transaction in trade or commerce.‚Äô</li>
<li>But that is not to say that a corporation must engage in multiple transactions of a similar kind for it to be engaged in trade or commerce</li>
<li>In our opinion, the making of the arrangements necessary to dispose of the clinic were part and parcel of the totality of the appellant‚Äôs activities in trade or commerce.‚Äô</li>
<li>But if the transaction is motivated by business, then it may be trade or commerc</li>

<li>Misleading def, deceptive def, misleading or deceptive defintion, misleading and deceptive def</li>
<li>[111] Condut is misleading or deceptive if it induces or is capable of inducing error.
<ul>
<li>In determining whether a contravention of [s 18] has occurred, the task of the court is to examine the relevant course of conduct as a whole.
<ul>
<li>It is determined by reference to the alleged conduct in the light of the relevant surrounding facts and circumstances.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is an objective question that the court must determine for itself.
<ul>
<li>It invites error to look at isolated parts of the corporation‚Äôs conduct.</li>

<ul>
<li>it involves consideration of a notional cause and effect relationship between the conduct and the state of mind of the relevant person or class of persons.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MISLEADING OR DECEPTIVE‚Äô
<ul>
<li>In dealings between identified individuals, the court will look at all the circumstances of the case:</li>
<li>The nature of the parties (Sophisticated business people dealing at arm‚Äôs length?</li>
<li>A consumer dealing with a corporation? Age, education, experience, etc)</li>
<li>The nature of the transaction (Sale of valuable property? Provision of a highly technical service? Purchase of a toilet brush?)</li>
<li>What was said/communicated in writing and how it was communicated.</li>
<li>What the parties knew about each other / how they presented themselves.</li>

<li>etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Choo v Zhang [2016] NSWCA 193 (5 August 2016)
<ul>
<li>But in a case where the impugned conduct is said to consist of representations, the question of whether the conduct was misleading or deceptive ordinarily must be determined by what a reasonable person in the position of the representee would have made of the representations, taking into account all relevant circumstances</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>OPINIONS / STATEMENT OF FUTURE MATTER
<ul>
<li>Common law reasoning can apply.</li>
<li>ie, it can be misleading or deceptive if a defendant gives an opinion or makes a statement of future action when:</li>
<li>They do not honestly believe the statement; or</li>
<li>Do not have reasonable grounds for making the statement</li>
<li>Campbell v Backoffice Investments Pty Ltd (2009) 238 CLR 304
<ul>
<li>Opinions may carry with them one or more implied representations according to the circumstances of the case.
<ul>
<li>There will ordinarily be an implied representation that the person offering the opinion actually holds it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other implied representations may be that the opinion is based upon reasonable grounds, which may include the representation that it was formed on the basis of reasonable enquiries.</li>

<li>STATEMENT OF FUTURE MATTER
<ul>
<li>Wheeler Grace and Pierucci Pty Ltd v Wright (1989) ATPR ¬∂40-940
<ul>
<li>Employee induced Wrights into investing in mining operation with a clear, unqualified promise that they would receive a certain return.</li>
<li>Wrights argued that employee impliedly represented that he had reasonable grounds for the promise when he made it, which he did not.</li>
<li>The implied representation was misleading or deceptive conduct.
<ul>
<li>The fact that the corporation believed or had reasonable grounds for belief that the prediction would be fulfilled, would not answer the question as to whether the conduct was misleading or deceptive conduct in trade or commerce.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Honest belief in and reasonable grounds for saying that something will occur may not prevent the statement being misleading or deceptive.
<ul>
<li>For example, if the context requires that the statement be qualified to acknowledge risk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>OPINIONS
<ul>
<li>Forrest v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (2012) 247 CLR 486
<ul>
<li>Forrest told an audience of sophisticated investors that Fortescue Metals Group had a ‚Äòbinding contract‚Äô with a Chinese company.</li>
<li>Fortescue had not signed a legally binding contract.</li>
<li>Anticipating an ‚Äòopinion‚Äô argument, ASIC argued that Forrest impliedly misrepresented that he had a reasonable ground for making the statement.</li>
<li>It is ultimately unprofitable to attempt to classify the statement according to some taxonomy, no matter whether that taxonomy adopts as its relevant classes fact and opinion, fact and law, or some mixture of these classes.
<ul>
<li>It is necessary instead to examine more closely and identify more precisely what it is that the impugned statements conveyed to their audience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The common law approach may be used, but not necessary.
<ul>
<li>Only question: would a reasonable person be misled or deceived by the defendant‚Äôs conduct?</li>

</li>
<li>STATEMENT OF FUTURE MATTER</li>
<li>Australian Consumer Law Section 4 ‚Äì Misleading representations with respect to future matters
<ul>
<li>(1) If:
<ul>
<li>(a) a person makes a representation with respect to any future matter (including the doing of, or the refusing to do, any act); and</li>
<li>(b) the person does not have reasonable grounds for making the representation;
<ul>
<li>the representation is taken, for the purposes of this Schedule, to be misleading.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(2) For the purposes of applying subsection (1) in relation to a proceeding concerning a representation made with respect to a future matter by:
<ul>
<li>(a) a party to the proceeding; or</li>
<li>(b) any other person;
<ul>
<li>the party ‚Ä¶ is taken not to have had reasonable grounds for making the representation, unless evidence is adduced to the contrary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="3">
<li>To avoid doubt, subsection (2) does not:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>(a) have the effect that, merely because such evidence to the contrary is adduced, the person who made the representation is taken to have had reasonable grounds for making the representation; or</li>
<li>(b) have the effect of placing on any person an onus of proving that the person who made the representation had reasonable grounds for making the representation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(4) Subsection (1) does not limit by implication the meaning of a reference in this Schedule to:
<ul>
<li>(a) a misleading representation; or</li>
<li>(b) a representation that is misleading in a material particular; or</li>
<li>(c) conduct that is misleading or is likely or liable to mislead;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>and, in particular, does not imply that a representation that a person makes with respect to any future matter is not misleading merely because the person has reasonable grounds for making the representation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SILENCE
<ul>
<li>At common law, silence is only a misrepresentation when there is a recognised duty to speak.</li>
<li>Under s 18, silence is misleading or deceptive in wider circumstances:</li>
<li>Where there is a common law duty to speak.</li>
<li>When the circumstances give right to a ‚Äòreasonable expectation‚Äô that the defendant would disclose something.</li>
<li>Demagogue Pty Ltd v Ramensky (1992) 39 FCR 31
<ul>
<li>Facts
<ul>
<li>Ramenskys bought terrace house off the plan.</li>
<li>Only vehicular access to land across land owned by third party.</li>
<li>Discussion and documents did not reveal that the driveway subject to approval by the third party.</li>
<li>Ramenskys argued that the failure to disclose the circumstances of the driveway was misleading or deceptive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The question is simply whether, having regard to all the relevant circumstances, there has been conduct that is misleading or deceptive or that is likely to mislead or deceive</li>
<li>That context may or may not include facts giving rise to a reasonable expectation, in the circumstances of the case for if particular matters exist they will be disclosed.</li>

<li>
<p>MISTAKE</p>
<ul>
<li>Mistake can manifest in two ways in contract:
<ul>
<li>It can vitiate consent (be a reason to avoid a contract).</li>
<li>Be a typographical error in a written agreement.</li>
<li>Remedy is rectification: studied in 71116 Remedies</li>
<li>In this subject, we look at mistake as a reason to avoid a contract.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MISTAKE AS A VITIATING FACTOR
<ul>
<li>Mistake is very rarely pleaded and rarely found to void a contract:
<ul>
<li>The mistake must be fundamental: it must make the contract unworkable, or it must be unconscionable to enforce it in light of the mistake: Couturier v Hastie (1856) 10 ER 1065</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bell v Lever Bros [1932] AC 161
<ul>
<li>So the agreement of A and B to purchase a specific article is void if in fact the article had perished before the date of sale.
<ul>
<li>In this case, though the parties in fact were agreed about the subject-matter, yet a consent to transfer or take delivery of something not existent is deemed useless, the consent is nullified.‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Often the contract will allocate the risks of any mistake, which can be resolved by construction or implication of terms.
<ul>
<li>The mistake must not be due to the fault of the defendant.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>McRae v Commonwealth Disposals Commission (1951) 84 CLR 377
<ul>
<li>the Commission cannot in this case rely on any mistake as avoiding the contract, because any mistake was induced by the serious fault of their own servants, who asserted the existence of a tanker recklessly and without any reasonable ground.
<ul>
<li>The Commission contracted that a tanker existed in the position specified.
<ul>
<li>Since there was no such tanker, there has been a breach of contract, and the plaintiffs are entitled to damages for that breach</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Often the mistake can be resolved by operation of other vitiating factors which are easier to prove.
<ul>
<li>Esp, misrepresentation or misleading or deceptive conduct.</li>
<li>Mistake concerns the subjective intentions of the parties, but contract law is premised on how parties objectively manifest their intentions.</li>
<li>Certainty of contract would be unacceptably disrupted if parties could avoid contracts because of mistakes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Smith v Hughes (1871) LR 6 QB 597
<ul>
<li>The rule of law is that stated in Freeman v Cooke.
<ul>
<li>If, whatever a man‚Äôs real intention may be, he so conducts himself that a reasonable man would believe that he was assenting to the terms proposed by the other party, and that other party upon that belief enters into the contract with him, the man thus conducting himself would be equally bound as if he had intended to agree to the other party‚Äôs terms.‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Three types of mistake:
<ul>
<li>Common mistake: both parties make the same mistake.</li>
<li>Mutual mistake: The parties are at ‚Äòcross purposes‚Äô because both parties have made their own mistake.</li>
<li>Unilateral mistake: The parties are at ‚Äòcross purposes‚Äô but only one party is mistaken.</li>

<li>Petelin v Cullen (1975) 132 CLR 355
<ul>
<li>first, the injustice of holding a person to a bargain to which he has not brought a consenting mind; and,</li>

<li>Toll (FGCT) Pty Ltd v Alphapharm Pty Ltd (2004) 219 CLR 165
<ul>
<li>Legal instruments of various kinds take their efficacy from signature or execution.</li>
<li>Such instruments are often signed by people who have not read and understood all their terms, but who are nevertheless committed to those terms by the act of signature or execution.
<ul>
<li>It is that commitment which enables third parties to assume the legal efficacy of the instrument.</li>
<li>To undermine that assumption would cause serious mischief.</li>

</li>
<li>ELEMENTS of Non Est Factum

<li>Legal instrument (contract, deed, etc) signed by a party;</li>
<li>Signer unable to read/understand the instrument</li>
<li>Signer:

<li>Subjectively mistaken about the legal effect of the instrument; or</li>
<li>Unable to comprehend the legal effect of the instrument.</li>

<li>Did the signer‚Äôs mind ‚Äúgo with the pen‚Äù?</li>

<li>Must not be due to the fault of the signer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>INABILITY TO READ / UNDERSTAND
<ul>
<li>Petelin v Cullen (1975) 132 CLR 355
<ul>
<li>Petelin (illiterate) granted option to Cullen to purchase land owned by Petelin.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cullen‚Äôs agent presented a ‚Äòreceipt‚Äô for signing, which was an extension of the option.</li>
<li>Petelin signed believing it was just a receipt for paying $50.</li>
<li>Cullen attempted to enforce the option.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>INSTRUMENT RADICALLY DIFFERENT
<ul>
<li>Saunders v Anglia Building Society [1971] AC 1004
<ul>
<li>Mrs Gallie believed that she transferred her house to her nephew (Parkin) so that he and his business partner (Lee) could use it as security in their business venture.</li>
<li>She could not read the transfer because her glasses were broken.</li>
<li>In fact, the document transferred the house to Lee.</li>
<li>They used the house as security for a loan from Anglia and defaulted.</li>
<li>Anglia moved to sell the house.</li>
<li>Mrs Gallie argued that the transfer to Lee was void due to non est factum, thus she retained ownership of it.</li>

<li>‚ÄòBut what upon the plaintiff‚Äôs own evidence was the essential character of the document she was intending to execute?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CARELESSNESS
<ul>
<li>Petelin v Cullen (1975) 132 CLR 355
<ul>
<li>The insistence that such precautions should be taken as a condition of making out the defence is of fundamental importance when the defence is asserted against an innocent person</li>
<li>It is otherwise when the defence is asserted against the other party to the transaction who is aware of the circumstances in which it came to be executed and who knows (because the document was signed on his representation) or has reason to suspect that it was executed under some misapprehension as to its character.
<ul>
<li>element of carelessness has no relevance for the present case.</li>
<li>The appellant‚Äôs belief that the document was a receipt was inspired by the agent‚Äôs representation</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>‚ÄòReasonable precautions‚Äô will depend upon the facts of the case.
<ul>
<li>For example:
<ul>
<li>Take reasonable steps to verify the contents of an instrument before signing.</li>
<li>Having a trusted person read/translate the instrument.</li>
<li>Wearing glasses or other aid if reasonably available.</li>

<li>
<p>Ford v Perpetual Trustees Victoria Limited (2009) 75 NSWLR 42</p>
<ul>
<li>Mr Ford: intellectually handicapped and practically illiterate.</li>
<li>Mr Ford‚Äôs son, Scott, manipulated Mr Ford into obtaining a loan from Perpetual and providing his house as security.</li>
<li>Loan arranged through third party broker, so Perpetual was unaware of Ford‚Äôs incapacity.</li>
<li>Ford argued his signature was voided by non est factum.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The totality of the findings are clear that Mr Ford did not know what he was signing, in that he did not understand anything at all about the documents he was signing such that it can be concluded that his mind did not go with his pen.</p>
<ul>
<li>Here, given the manipulation of Mr Ford by his son, it cannot be concluded that he failed to take any precautions that a person in his position and with his attributes should have.</li>

<li>UNILATERAL MISTAKE IN EQUITY
<ul>
<li>Equity can also void a written contract entered under a mistake about a fundamental term.
<ul>
<li>More than mistake is required: it must be unconscionable to hold the mistaken party to the signed document.</li>
<li>Typically, that requires the non-mistaken party to take steps to ensure the mistaken party does not discover their mistake.</li>

<li>Goldsbrough Mort &amp; Co Ltd v Quinn (1910) 10 CLR 674
<ul>
<li>Quinn granted an option to sell his land for ‚Äò¬£1 10s per acre calculated on a freehold basis.‚Äô</li>

<li>Taylor v Johnson (1983) 151 CLR 422
<ul>
<li>Lead case in unilateral mistakes</li>
<li>Mrs Johnson granted an option to sell 10 acres of land to the Taylors, which they exercised.</li>
<li>Mrs Johnson believed that the price was $15,000 per acre.
<ul>
<li>The price recorded in both the option and later contract was $15,000 for the entire 10 acres.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Evidence suggested that the Taylors knew Mrs Johnson was mistaken and they actively prevented her from discovering the truth.</li>
<li>It is that a party who has entered into a written contract under a serious mistake about its contents in relation to a fundamental term will be entitled in equity to an order rescinding the contract if the other party is aware

<li>False imprisonment.</li>

<li>ECONOMIC DURESS

<li>Threatened unlawful interference with the plaintiff‚Äôs financial or other economic interests.</li>
<li>Common issue:

<li>where is the boundary between ‚Äòillegitimate pressure‚Äô and ‚Äòhard bargaining‚Äô?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Barton v Armstrong [1976] AC 104
<ul>
<li>‚Äò[An alleged case of duress] involves consideration of what the law regards as voluntary, or its opposite; for in life, including the life of commerce and finance, many acts are done under pressure, sometimes overwhelming pressure, so that one can say that the actor had no choice but to act.</li>
<li>Absence of choice in this sense does not negate consent in law: for this the pressure must be one of a kind which the law does not regard as legitimate. Thus, out of the various means by which consent may be obtained ‚Äì advice, persuasion, influence, inducement, representation, commercial pressure - the law has come to select some which it will not accept as a reason for voluntary action: fraud, abuse of relation of confidence, undue influence, duress or coercion.‚Äô (Lord Wilberforce and Lord Simon of Glaisdale (Dissent))</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The mere fact that pressure is applied ‚Äì even overwhelming pressure ‚Äì or that parties bargain from unequal bargaining positions is not sufficient to amount to duress.</li>
<li>Crescendo Management v Westpac (1988) 19 NSWLR 40
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe proper approach in my opinion is to: ask whether any applied pressure induced the victim to enter into the contract and then ask whether that pressure went beyond what the law is prepared to countenance as legitimate?
<ul>
<li>Pressure will be illegitimate if it consists of unlawful threats ‚Ä¶ But the categories are not closed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Even overwhelming pressure, not amounting to unconscionable or unlawful conduct, however, will not necessarily constitute economic duress.‚Äô (McHugh JA)</li>

<li>The Universe Sentinel [1983] 1 AC 366
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòIn determining what is legitimate two matters may have to be considered.
<ul>
<li>The first is as to the nature of the pressure.</li>
<li>In many cases this will be decisive, though not in every case.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And so the second question may have to be considered, namely, the nature of the demand which the pressure is applied to support.‚Äô (401, Lord Scarman)</li>

<li>‚Äòwhat does it matter what particular form of coercion is used, so long as the will is coerced?

<li>To the contrary, there appears to be much to be said for the view that, rather than persist with a blanket restriction of illegitimate pressure to pressure exerted by unlawful means, it would better accord with equitable principle, and better align with English and American authority, if the test of illegitimate pressure were whether the pressure goes beyond what is reasonably necessary for the protection of legitimate interests ..‚Äô (Nettle J, citations omitted)</li>

<ul>
<li>‚ÄòIt is unnecessary, however, for the victim to prove that the illegitimate pressure was the sole reason for him entering into the contract.</li>
<li>It is sufficient that the illegitimate pressure was one of the reasons for the person entering into the agreement.</li>
<li>Once the evidence establishes that the pressure exerted on the victim was illegitimate, the onus lies on the person applying the pressure to show that it made no contribution to the victim entering into the agreement: Barton v Armstrong [1976] AC 104.‚Äô(McHugh JA)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Coercion
<ul>
<li>Coercion is easy to prove in duress of person and duress of property:</li>
<li>the law vigilantly protects the sanctity of the person and property interests.</li>
<li>It‚Äôs harder to establish causation in economic duress cases, because the plaintiff will always have the option to refuse, seek legal advice, reserve rights, etc.</li>
<li>The more reasonable options available to the plaintiff, the easier it will be for the defendant to argue that the plaintiff acted voluntarily.</li>

</li>
<li>Mason v New South Wales (1959) 102 CLR 108
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòIt is all very well to say in such a case that there was an alternative to payment, namely to carry on as if ss. 12 and 28 had not been passed, resist the resulting prosecutions by pleading the invalidity of the Act, seek protection from the courts by injunction or otherwise in respect of a seizure, and appeal, if necessary to the Privy Council, against any unfavourable decision.

<ul>
<li>Common law duress requires the application of illegitimate pressure.</li>
<li>Equity will relieve a plaintiff of a contract obtained by ‚Äòundue‚Äô influence, which may be less than ‚Äòillegitimate‚Äô pressure.</li>
<li>Allcard v Skinner (1887) 36 Ch D 145
<ul>
<li>Or is it that it is right and expedient to save them from being victimised by other people?
<ul>
<li>In my opinion the doctrine of undue influence is founded upon the second of these two principles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On the other hand, to protect people from being forced, tricked or misled in any way by others into parting with their property is one of the most legitimate objects of all laws;
<ul>
<li>and the equitable doctrine of undue influence has grown out of and been developed by the necessity of grappling with insidious forms of spiritual tyranny and with the infinite varieties of fraud.‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>COMPARISON WITH DURESS
<ul>
<li>Duress is sometimes seen as an extreme form of undue influence.</li>
<li>Whereas:
<ul>
<li>a victim of duress will be consciously coerced into a contract,</li>
<li>undue influence can be subtle, well-intended and the victim may not be aware of it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Thorne v Kennedy (2017) 263 CLR 85
<ul>
<li>‚Äúno Court has ever attempted to define undue influence‚Äù‚Ä¶ the boundaries, particularly between undue influence and duress, are blurred.</li>
<li>One reason why there is no clear distinction is that undue influence can arise from widely different sources,</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2 FORMS OF UNDUE INFLUENCE
<ul>
<li>Johnson v Buttress (1936) 56 CLR 113
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe jurisdiction of a court of equity to set aside gifts [and contracts] inter vivos which have been procured by undue influence is exercised where
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>undue influence is proved as a fact, or [‚Äòactual undue influence‚Äô]</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Typically a trick (scared out of cookie)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>where, undue influence being presumed from the relations existing between the parties, the presumption has not been rebutted.‚Äô [‚Äòpresumed undue influence‚Äô]</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Typically a relational advantage (give brother cookie)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>ACTUAL UNDUE INFLUENCE</p>
<ul>
<li>Actual Undue Influence
<ul>
<li>Johnson v Buttress (1936) 56 CLR 113
<ul>
<li>‚Äòfacts must be proved showing that the transaction was the outcome of such an actual influence over the mind of the [plaintiff] that it cannot be considered his free act.‚Äô (134, Dixon J)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Credit and Commerce International SA v Aboody [1990] 1 QB 923
<ul>
<li>‚Äô‚Ä¶ we think that a person relying on a plea of actual undue influence must show that:
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>the other party to the transaction (or someone who induced the transaction for his own benefit) had the capacity to influence the complainant;</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>the influence was exercised;</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="3">
<li>its exercise was undue;</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="4">
<li>its exercise brought about the transaction.‚Äô (Slade LJ)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CAPACITY TO INFLUENCE
<ul>
<li>Influential relationships are very common, thus the capacity to influence is seldom difficult to establish.
<ul>
<li>Influential relationships can take infinite forms.</li>
<li>Often there will be unequal bargaining power.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Typically, the relationships involve close, personal relationships of trust, confidence or reliance:
<ul>
<li>Spouses</li>
<li>Family members</li>
<li>Professionals/clients</li>
<li>Religious teachers/followers</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>INFLUENCE IN FACT EXERCISED
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòInfluence‚Äô can take any form:</li>
<li>Over threats Persistent persuasion.</li>
<li>Taking advantage of someone at an unusual time or place ‚Äì esp if they‚Äôre distracted or vulnerable.</li>
<li>Taking advantage of a position of authority.</li>
<li>Merely being a silent, but forceful, presence in the room.</li>
<li>Having others apply pressure or persuasion.</li>
<li>Key consideration: the quality of the consent of the plaintiff.</li>
<li>Johnson v Buttress (1936) 56 CLR 113
<ul>
<li>‚Äòfacts must be proved showing that the transaction was the outcome of such an actual influence over the mind of the alienor that it cannot be considered his free act.‚Äô (134, Dixon J)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Micarone v Perpetual Trustees (1999) 75 SASR 1
<ul>
<li>[286] ‚Ä¶ the question is not whether, in the literal sense, there was the exercise of an independent and voluntary will, but whether that exercise took place in an environment in which the actors were able to form a proper judgment ‚Ä¶ .
<ul>
<li>If the conclusion arrived at negates that proposition, actual undue influence is made out</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Farmers‚Äô Co-operative Executors &amp; Trustees Ltd v Perks (1989) 52 SASR 399
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòIn my view, the defendant dominated his wife by the constant employment of actual and threatened violence and it is against this background that the events more directly concerned with the transfer of her share in the property fall to be considered.‚Äô (410, Duggan J)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Credit and Commerce International SA v Aboody [1990] 1 QB 923
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe mere fact that in order to get his own way he chose deliberately to say nothing as to the risks, rather than to misrepresent them, would not, in our judgment, save his conduct from being unconscionable or absolve him from a charge of actual undue influence, bearing in mind that it was he who invited her to enter into them.
<ul>
<li>On the particular facts of this case we think it could fairly be said that Mrs. Aboody‚Äôs mind was in effect ‚Äúa mere channel through which the will of [Mr. Aboody] operated: ‚Ä¶‚Äô (969, The Court)</li>

<li>‚ÄòUNDUE‚Äô INFLUENCE
<ul>
<li>Allcard v Skinner (1887) 36 Ch D 145
<ul>
<li>The law does not exclude influence. Nay, it recognises influence as natural and right.
<ul>
<li>Few, if any, men are gifted with characters enabling them to act, or even think, with complete independence of others, which could not largely exist without destroying the foundations of society.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But the law requires that, influence, however natural and right, shall not be unduly exercised, that is, shall be exercised only in due proportion to the surrounding circumstances and the strength of the person submitted to it.</li>
<li>The more powerful influence or the weaker patient alike evokes a stronger application of the safeguard ‚Ä¶‚Äô (157-158, Kewich J)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Context matters.
<ul>
<li>Compare:
<ul>
<li>Overbearing salesperson dealing with frail, elderly pensioner.</li>
<li>Overbearing salesperson dealing with educated professional.</li>
<li>Negotiations between large commercial corporations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Poosathurdi v Kanappa Chettiar (1919) LR 47 Ind App 1
<ul>
<li>‚Äò[Influence] may be used wisely, judiciously and helpfully.</li>
<li>But‚Ä¶ more than mere influence must be proved so as to render influence, in the language of the law, ‚Äòundue‚Äô.</li>
<li>It must be established that the person in a position of domination has used that position to obtain unfair advantage for himself.‚Äô (4, Privy Council)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Johnson v Buttress (1936) 56 CLR 113
<ul>
<li>‚Äô‚Ä¶ when the transaction is not one of gift but of purchase or other contract, the matters affecting its validity are necessarily somewhat different.</li>
<li>Adequacy of consideration becomes a material question.‚Äô (136, Dixon J)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>National Westminster Bank Plc v Morgan [1985] 1 AC 686
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThere is no substitute in this branch of the law for a ‚Äúmeticulous examination of the facts.‚Äô (Lord Scarman)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CAUSATION
<ul>
<li>The undue influence must be a cause of the plaintiff agreeing to the contract.</li>
<li>Thorne v Kennedy (2017) 263 CLR 85
<ul>
<li>[24] ‚Ä¶ Where duress, undue influence, or unconscionable conduct is otherwise shown, an inference of the necessary causation or contribution is readily drawn if the particular transaction cannot reasonably be accounted for by ‚Äúordinary motives‚Äù ‚Ä¶ .‚Äô (Kiefel CJ, Bell, Gageler, Keane and Edelman JJ)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Credit and Commerce International SA v Aboody [1990] 1 QB 923
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòHowever, in our judgment, ‚Ä¶ the jurisdiction exercised by the court in such cases is not essentially of a punitive nature; its purpose is to do justice to the complainant in suitable circumstances giving him or her relief from a disadvantageous transaction.</li>
<li>We think that, at least in ordinary circumstances, it would not be appropriate for the court to exercise this jurisdiction in a case where the evidence establishes that on balance of probabilities the complainant would have entered into the transaction in any event.‚Äô (971, The Court)</li>

<li>PRESUMED UNDUE INFLUENCE
<ul>
<li>Actual undue influence def
<ul>
<li>The influence must have in fact caused the transaction.</li>
<li>Onus on the plaintiff to prove every element: influence + causation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Presumed undue influence def
<ul>
<li>Plaintiff proves the context of the transaction and raises a presumption that the transaction was procured by undue influence.</li>
<li>Onus then shifts to defendant to disprove undue influence caused the transaction.</li>
<li>Useful if the plaintiff has no or limited evidence on how contract formed.</li>
<li>BUT, if onus discharged then transaction stands.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Many fact scenarios can support a case for both actual and presumed undue influence.
<ul>
<li>Farmers‚Äô Co-operative Executors &amp; Trustees Ltd v Perks (1989) 52 SASR 399
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòI am of the view that over the years the defendant achieved an ascendancy over the deceased and I find established as a matter of fact that a special relationship of control and dominance existed.</li>
<li>The relationship which I have found is sufficient, on the authorities, to give rise to a presumption that the deceased transferred her share in the property to the defendant as the result of undue influence on his part.
<ul>
<li>There is no doubt in my mind that the presumption has not been rebutted. ‚Ä¶ Rather it is my view that the evidence goes further than simply giving rise to the presumption; it establishes a case of actual undue influence.‚Äô (416-417, Duggan J)</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2 CLASSES OF PRESUMED UNDUE INFLUENCE
<ul>
<li>Johnson v Buttress (1936) 56 CLR 113
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòWhere certain special relations exist undue influence is presumed</li>
<li>Wherever the relation between donor and donee is such that the latter is in a position to exercise dominion over the former by reason of the trust and confidence reposed in the latter, the presumption of undue influence is raised</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>FIDUCIARY RELATIONSHIPS
<ul>
<li>If the relationship between the parties is fiduciary, then the law will presume undue influence on proof of that relationship without more.
<ul>
<li>Examples:
<ul>
<li>Solicitor to client</li>
<li>Doctor to patient</li>
<li>Religious adviser to disciple</li>
<li>Parent (or person in loco parentis) to child</li>
<li>Guardian to ward</li>
<li>Trustee to beneficiary</li>
<li>DOES NOT INCLUDE: Siblings; Child/Parent; Husband/Wife;</li>
<li>Employer/employee; Banker/customer</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation (1984) 156 CLR 41
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe critical feature of these relationships is that the fiduciary undertakes or agrees to act for or on behalf of or in the interests of another person in the exercise of a power or discretion which will affect the interests of that other person in a legal or practical sense.
<ul>
<li>The relationship between the parties is therefore one which gives the fiduciary a special opportunity to exercise the power or discretion to the detriment of that other person who is accordingly vulnerable to abuse by the fiduciary of his position.‚Äô (96-97, Mason J)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>PRESUMPTION IN FACT
<ul>
<li>Johnson v Buttress (1936) 56 CLR 113
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe [fiduciary] relations mentioned, however, do not constitute an exhaustive list of the cases in which undue influence will be presumed from personal relations.
<ul>
<li>Wherever the relation between donor and donee is such that the latter is in a position to exercise dominion over the former by reason of the trust and confidence reposed in the latter, the presumption of undue influence is raised ‚Ä¶ .</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Facts
<ul>
<li>Mr Buttress: low intelligence, illiterate, totally dependant on Mrs Johnson in business and finance matters.</li>
<li>Mr Johnson gave away his only real asset to Mrs Johnson during his lifetime.</li>
<li>Mr Johnson‚Äôs estate sought to rescind the transfer by raising a presumption of undue influence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>One occupying such a position falls under a duty in which fiduciary characteristics may be seen.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tulloch (deceased) v Braybon (No 2) [2010] NSWSC 650 (17 June 2010)
<ul>
<li>In my opinion, ‚Ä¶ more than mere confidence and reciprocal influence is required to establish a ‚Äúspecial relationship of influence‚Äù from the existence of which undue influence will be presumed unless rebutted;
<ul>
<li>for a relationship to be brought within the doctrine, it must go beyond one of mere confidence and influence, to one involving dominion or ascendancy by one over the will of the other, and correlatively dependence and subjection on the part of the other.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<li>Thorne v Kennedy (2017) 263 CLR 85
<ul>
<li>[34] ‚Ä¶ A presumption ‚Ä¶ arises where common experience is that the existence of one fact means that another fact also exists.</li>
<li>Common experience gives rise to a presumption that a transaction was not the exercise of a person‚Äôs free will if
<ul>
<li>(i) the person is proved to be in a particular relationship, and</li>
<li>(ii) the transaction is one, commonly involving a ‚Äúsubstantial benefit‚Äù to another, which cannot be explained by ‚Äúordinary motives‚Äù, or ‚Äúis not readily explicable by the relationship of the parties‚Äù.‚Äù (Kiefel CJ, Bell, Gageler, Keane and Edelman JJ)</li>

<li>Inche Noriah v Shaik Allie Bin Omar [1929] AC 127
<ul>
<li>It is necessary for the [defendant] to prove that the gift was the result of the free exercise of independent will.
<ul>
<li>The most obvious way to prove this is by establishing that the gift was made after the nature and effect of the transaction had been fully explained to the [plaintiff] by some independent and qualified person so completely as to satisfy the Court that the [plaintiff] was acting independently of any influence from the [defendant] and with the full appreciation of what he was doing;</li>
</ul>

<li>Equity is the ‚Äòcourt of conscience‚Äô, hence, many of its principles are directed to preventing unconscionable conduct.</li>

<ol start="2">
<li>that disability was sufficiently evident to the stronger party to make it prima facie unfair or ‚Äúunconscientious‚Äù that he procure, or accept, the weaker party‚Äôs assent to the impugned transaction in the circumstances in which he procured or accepted it.</li>

<li>Kakavas v Crown Melbourne Limited (2013) 250 CLR 392
<ul>
<li>[161] Equitable intervention to deprive a party of the benefit of its bargain on the basis that it was procured by unfair exploitation of the weakness of the other party requires proof of a predatory state of mind.
<ul>
<li>Heedlessness of, or indifference to, the best interests of the other party is not sufficient for this purpose.</li>
<li>The principle is not engaged by mere inadvertence, or even indifference, to the circumstances of the other party to an arm‚Äôs length commercial transaction.</li>

</li>
<li>Inadvertence, or indifference, falls short of the victimisation or exploitation with which the principle is concerned.</li>

<li>Nitopi v Nitopi [2022] NSWCA 162
<ul>
<li>[9] In my view, the only way to reconcile Kakavas and Thorne in relation to questions of knowledge is that Kakavas must be understood as standing as authority only for the negative proposition that constructive notice is insufficient but not as standing for the additional proposition that constructive knowledge of a special disadvantage in the sense I have explained is also insufficient. (Bell CJ)</li>

<li>[28] In Wu v Ling [2016] NSWCA 322 at [14], Leeming JA observed in considering the passage from Kakavas extracted at [23] above that ‚Äúvictimisation in this context is no narrow concept‚Äù.</li>
<li>His Honour was surely correct in so doing. ‚Ä¶ were it otherwise, it becomes almost impossible to accommodate statements of high authority to the effect that the passive acceptance or retention of a benefit may, in certain circumstances, be unconscionable and result in a transaction being set aside or a gift successfully impeached.

<li>Blomley v Ryan (1956) 99 CLR 362, 405
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòIt does not appear to be essential in all cases that the party at a disadvantage should suffer loss or detriment by the bargain. ‚Ä¶</li>
<li>But inadequacy of consideration, while never of itself a ground for resisting enforcement, will often be a specially important element in cases of this type. It may be important in either or both of two ways firstly as supporting the inference that a position of disadvantage existed, and secondly as tending to show that an unfair use was made of the occasion.‚Äô (406, Fullagar J)</li>

<li>Kakavas v Crown Melbourne Limited (2013) 250 CLR 392
<ul>
<li>Kakavas = ‚Äòhigh roller‚Äô gambler.</li>
<li>Crown encouraged Kakavas to gamble by providing him benefits such as free accommodation etc.</li>
<li>Kakavas lost $20m in 1 year.</li>
<li>Kakavas wanted to void the transactions by arguing that he was addicted to gambling and Crown exploited that disadvantage.</li>
<li>High Court held that he was not at a special disadvantage and Crown had no knowledge.</li>
<li>Gambling transactions are a rare, if not unique, species of economic activity in a civilised community, in that each party sets out openly to inflict harm on the counterparty.</li>
<li>The plaintiff must be able to point to conduct on the part of the defendant, beyond the ordinary conduct of the business, which makes it just to require the defendant to restore the plaintiff to his or her previous position.</li>

<li>Johnson v Smith [2010] NSWCA 306
<ul>
<li>Mother with dementia gifted $540,000 to son.</li>
<li>Gift was notionally for the purpose of giving the son funds to spend on his mother‚Äôs wellbeing if she needed it.</li>
<li>However, he denied any legal obligation to spend it only on his mother.</li>
<li>Was it unconscionable for him to retain the gift unconditionally?</li>
<li>it is the attempt to retain the benefit obtained from the special disadvantage of his mother that is the issue.</li>
<li>This may occur because of the unconscientious use of power arising or existing in the circumstances or (as here) the unconscientious attempt to retain the benefit obtained from the person with the special disadvantage.‚Äù</li>

</li>
<li>Independent Advice
<ul>
<li>Proof of independent advice may demonstrate that the plaintiff was not at a disadvantage because someone else was looking after their interests.</li>
<li>However, the effectiveness of the advice will depend upon the facts.</li>
<li>Stubbings v Jams 2 Pty Ltd (2022) 96 ALJR 271
<ul>
<li>Lawyer (agent for lenders) contrived a system of communication that kept borrowers at a distance so that they would not become aware of any special disadvantages (ie, wilful blindness)</li>
<li>Borrowers obliged to obtain advice and provide signed:
<ul>
<li>Certificate of Financial Advice; and</li>
<li>Certificate of Legal Advice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>that the certificates were mere ‚Äúwindow dressing‚Äù.
<ul>
<li>‚Ä¶ The certificates might also be seen to have been a precautionary artifice designed to prevent an inference that the respondents were wilfully blind to the obvious danger to the appellant.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[49] ‚Ä¶ Indeed, one might regard the deployment of such artifices in a context where the lender or its agent deliberately distances itself from evidence that must confirm the dangerous nature of the transaction for the borrower or its guarantor as evidence pointing to an exploitative state of mind on the part of the lender.

<ul>
<li>‚Äò‚Ä¶relief on the ground of ‚Äúunconscionable conduct‚Äù is usually taken to refer to the class of case in which a party makes unconscientious use of his superior position or bargaining power to the detriment of a party who suffers from some special disability or is placed in some special situation of disadvantage.‚Äô (461)
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòAlthough unconscionable conduct in this narrow sense bears some resemblance to the doctrine of undue influence, there is a difference between the two.</li>
<li>In the latter the will of the innocent party is not independent and voluntary because it is overborne.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the former the will of the innocent party, even if independent and voluntary, is the result of the disadvantageous position in which he is placed and of the other party unconscientiously taking advantage of that position.‚Äô</li>

<ul>
<li>Facts
<ul>
<li>Mrs Sadiq and her son orally agreed to sell a newly-built house to Mr and Mrs Khan.</li>
<li>The Khans moved in before settlement but relations with Mrs Sadiq soured.</li>
<li>Mrs Sadiq repudiated the agreement.</li>
<li>Meeting of families called, presided over by local mufti. (Islamic jurist who can advise on religious law.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The meeting lasted for hours.
<ul>
<li>Her family and mufti pressured Mrs Sadiq to complete the sale.</li>
<li>The purchasers were present at all times.</li>
<li>Mrs Sadiq was a religious person. The mufti quoted several religious authorities and said that she would be rewarded in the afterlife.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Held
<ul>
<li>[21] In the ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúthird party‚Äù case ‚Ä¶ evidence must ‚Ä¶ show that

<li>[the third party] had influence over [a party to the contract ‚Äì‚Äòinfluenced party‚Äô];</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>

<ol start="3">
<li>[the other party to the contract] unconscientiously derived a benefit from the conduct of [the influenced party] knowing that that conduct was a result of the influence of [the third party] rather than [the influenced party]‚Äòs will. (Barrett J)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The case is one in which Mrs Sadiq, under the religious influence of Mufti Naiem, contracted to dispose of property to [the purchasers] who had notice of that influence and the effect of it upon Mrs Sadiq‚Äôs will.
<ul>
<li>The bargain under which they received a benefit from Mrs Sadiq is therefore one which equity regards as unconscionable and will not allow to be enforced against Mrs Sadiq.</li>

<li>Uncle had cared for Miss Rogers for 23 years after her parents were killed.</li>
<li>Uncle faced bankruptcy and owed money to the Bank.</li>
<li>Uncle persuaded Miss Rogers to provide her only substantial asset as security.</li>
<li>Miss Rogers did not know Uncle faced bankruptcy and was unlikely to recover.</li>
<li>She signed the documents at the Bank but it did not explain the transaction to her.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Facts justify the inference ‚Ä¶ that the bank knew that some special relationship existed
<ul>
<li>it was for the bank to establish that the security given to it by the respondent was free from any undue influence and was the voluntary and well-understood act of her mind</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At no time when the respondent signed any document charging her shares in favour of the bank was she severed from Gardiner‚Äôs influence. ‚Ä¶</li>

<ul>
<li>Garcia v National Australia Bank (1998) 194 CLR 395

<li>[25] Thus, Dixon J was dealing with two kinds of case. In the former, the case of actual undue influence</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2ND CLASS: WIFE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND
<ul>
<li>[23] In his reasons for decision in Yerkey v Jones, Dixon J dealt with at least two kinds of circumstances:
<ul>
<li>the first in which there is actual undue influence by a husband over a wife and</li>
<li>the second ‚Ä¶ in which there is no undue influence but there is a failure to explain suretyship transaction which the husband seeks to have the wife enter for the immediate economic benefit not of the wife but of the husband, or the circumstances in which her liability may arise.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Yerkey v Jones begins with the recognition that the surety is a volunteer</li>
<li>VOLUNTEER
<ul>
<li>Notice of husband/wife relationship sufficient to ground the claim:
<ul>
<li>no need for notice of undue influence or other impropriety.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The wife must be a ‚Äòvolunteer‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>NOTICE OF MARRIAGE RELATIONSHIP
<ul>
<li>Garcia v National Australia Bank (1998) 194 CLR 395
<ul>
<li>[40] We consider that the only question of notice that arises is whether the creditor knew at the time of the taking of the guarantee that the surety was then married to the borrower.</li>
<li>Other questions of notice do not intrude.</li>
<li>And what makes it unconscionable to enforce it in the second kind of case is the combination of circumstances that
<ul>
<li>a) in fact the surety did not understand the purport and effect of the transaction;</li>
<li>b) the transaction was voluntary (in the sense that the surety obtained no gain from the contract the performance of which was guaranteed);</li>
<li>c) the lender is to be taken to have understood that, as a wife, the surety may repose trust and confidence in her husband in matters of business and therefore to have understood that the husband may not fully and accurately explain the purport and effect of the transaction to his wife; and yet</li>
<li>d) the lender did not itself take steps to explain the transaction to the wife or find out that a stranger had explained it to her.</li>

<ul>
<li>Defective performance def
<ul>
<li>If a binding contract is not performed properly by a defaulting party, then the law can provide the following remedies to the ‚Äòinnocent‚Äô party.
<ul>
<li>First, if the contract has been seriously breached or repudiated, then the innocent party use the ‚Äòself-help‚Äô remedy of terminating the contract. We looked at these concepts of termination for breach and repudiation in Module 7.</li>
<li>Second, the law can order the defaulting party to pay damages in place of performance, or it can order the defaulting party to specifically perform it.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The word ‚Äúrescission‚Äù is ambiguous. It is sometimes used to encompass not only ‚Äúrescission‚Äù ab initio for misrepresentation but also ‚Äúrescission‚Äù prospectively for breach and sometimes just to refer to ‚Äúrescission‚Äù ab initio for misrepresentation.
<ul>
<li>For clarity, I use that term exclusively to denote a rescission which has the effect of avoiding the contract (and actions taken under it) from the outset (eg for misrepresentation) and I use the term ‚Äútermination‚Äù to denote a termination of future performance only (or dissolution) of the contract (eg for breach).</li>

<li>When a party to a simple contract, upon breach by the other contracting party of a condition of the contract, elects to treat the contract as no longer binding upon him, the contract is not rescinded as from the beginning.
<ul>
<li>Both parties are discharged from the further performance of the contract, but rights are not divested or discharged which have already been unconditionally acquired.</li>

<li>Election
<ul>
<li>Election def
<ul>
<li>If a party has the right to end a contract - whether that is a right to terminate because of the other party‚Äôs default or a right to rescind because their consent was vitiated - then that party must choose whether to end the contract.</li>
<li>The process of choosing is called ‚Äòelection‚Äô.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>PART 1 HOW TO ELECT
<ul>
<li>Election is a general legal principle that applies when a person must choose between legally inconsistent outcomes.</li>
<li>When a contract is voidable due to vitiating conduct, the plaintiff must choose (elect) between two legally inconsistent outcomes:
<ul>
<li>Rescind the contract; or</li>
<li>Affirm (and continue to be bound by) the contract.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once the choice is unequivocally made, the plaintiff cannot change their mind.</li>
<li>Eg, if a plaintiff has elected to affirm the contract, then rescission or termination is no longer possible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A binding election requires:
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Full knowledge of the ‚Äòmaterial facts‚Äô (ie, at least knowledge of the vitiating conduct; maybe also knowledge of the right to rescind.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Unequivocal conduct indicating affirmation or rescission/termination</li>
<li>Conduct is judged objectively:
<ul>
<li>there is no need for the plaintiff to subjectively intend to elect.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sargent v ASL Developments Ltd (1974) 131 CLR 634
<ul>
<li>Term in contract for the sale of land provided a right to terminate if certain planning controls were imposed over the land.</li>
<li>The planning controls were imposed.</li>
<li>Despite this, the sellers continued to perform the contract.</li>
<li>32 months later, the sellers purported to terminate the contract, relying on the term.
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe words or conduct ordinarily required to constitute an election must be unequivocal in the sense that it is consistent only with the exercise of one of the two sets of rights and inconsistent with the exercise of the other ‚Ä¶ For an election there need be no actual, subjective intention to elect ‚Ä¶ an election is the effect which the law attributes to conduct justifiable only if such an election had been made</li>

<li>Tropical Traders Ltd v Goonan (1964) 111 CLR 41
<ul>
<li>Contract for the sale of land provided for payment of the price in instalments over 5 years.</li>
<li>Time was of the essence for payment of the balance on 6 January 1963.</li>
<li>6 Jan: Purchaser failed to pay and asked for 3 more months.</li>
<li>Seller: ‚ÄòThe company will not take action under the contract until Monday, 14 January</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tropical Traders Ltd v Goonan (1964) 111 CLR 41
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe company will not take action under the contract until Monday, 14 January but this must be regarded as an act of grace on the part of the Company and without prejudice to and in no way varying the Company‚Äôs right to strict enforcement of the contract.‚Äô</li>

<li>Immer (No 145) Pty Ltd v Uniting Church in Australia Property Trust (NSW) (1993) 182 CLR 26
<ul>
<li>Sale of air rights subject to Council approval by 1 April 1989.</li>
<li>Approval not granted by 1 April: both parties in a position to terminate.</li>
<li>26 June: Immer sends settlement documents to the</li>
<li>Trust under mistaken belief that the Council had approve the transfer.</li>
<li>26 August: Immer terminates the contract.
<ul>
<li>Were its actions consistent only with an intention to keep the agreement on foot and inconsistent with the exercise of the right to rescind</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>‚ÄòIf a party to a contract, faced with the choice of terminating the contract or keeping it on foot, terminates the contract that party will ordinarily have acted in a way that leaves no doubt as to the choice made.‚Äô (41, Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ)
<ul>
<li>‚Äô‚Ä¶ at the heart of election is the idea of confrontation which in turn produces the necessity of making a choice.</li>
<li>But in a case such as the present one, the choice is not merely one of affirming the agreement; it involves as well the abandonment of the right to rescind.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>‚Äô ‚Ä¶ where the right to rescind is a continuing one, it is not so readily concluded that the party entitled to rescind has abandoned that right completely as opposed to taking no action to exercise the right at the time in question. (42, Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ)</li>

<li>On discovering the fraud, Caldwell enlisted the police and a car association to help him find his car.</li>

</li>
<li>Restrictions on the right to end a contract
<ul>
<li>Even if a party wants to terminate or rescind a contract, they may find that their right to do so is lost.</li>
<li>Affirmation
<ul>
<li>The right to elect presents the relevant party with two inconsistent choices:
<ul>
<li>either end the contract (ie, terminate or rescind it) or affirm it and continue performing.</li>
<li>If the the party elects to affirm the contract, then the right to end it is lost unless a ‚Äòfresh‚Äô right to end it later accrues.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>RESTRICTIONS: AFFIRMATION
<ul>
<li>The plaintiff must elect to end or affirm a contract when:
<ul>
<li>The contract is breach or repudiated.</li>
<li>Their consent was vitiated.</li>
<li>A contingency is fulfilled providing a right to terminate.</li>
<li>But sometimes the plaintiff‚Äôs choice is restricted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If seller affirms:
<ul>
<li>Right to terminate is surrendered.</li>
<li>Seller can sue for damages.</li>
<li>Parties obliged to continue performing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A second breach will create a fresh right to terminate.</li>
<li>Foran v Wight (1989) 168 CLR 385
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòAlthough he may do so, the other party does not have to accept the repudiation.</li>
<li>He may continue to treat the contract as on foot and hold the party guilty of repudiation to the performance of his obligations.</li>
<li>If those obligations remain unperformed when the time for performance arrives, the anticipatory breach will be converted into an actual breach.</li>
<li>If the other party keeps the contract alive, he does so not only for his own benefit but also for the benefit of the party guilty of repudiation.</li>

<li>Coastal Estates Pty Ltd v Melevende [1965] VR 433
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòIn my opinion, affirmation as a defence to a claim to rescind a contract rests on the principle that having elected to adhere to a contract after discovery of the falsity of the representations inducing it, the right to rescind is lost.</li>
<li>In other words affirmation is the determination of an election by affirming the contract.</li>
<li>Affirmation may take the form of an express communication from the representee that he has elected to treat the contract as binding, or conduct of his in relation to the contract or its subject matter from which the proper inference is that he has so elected.‚Äô (452, Adam J)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Termination: RESTRICTIONS: Ready, Willing and Able
<ul>
<li>Focusing now on the right to terminate for breach or repudiation, the party who has such a right will not be able to terminate the contract if they are not ready, willing and able to perform it.</li>
<li>A plaintiff who wishes to elect for breach or repudiation must be ‚Äòready, willing and able‚Äô to perform their own obligations at the time of election.
<ul>
<li>Psaltis v Schultz (1948) 76 CLR 547
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòTo be ready and willing to perform a contract a party must not only be disposed to do the act promised but also have the capacity to do it.</li>
<li>But the tenor of the promise will show when and how the act is to be performed and it is to that time and mode of performance that the capacity and disposition to fulfil the promise are to be directed.‚Äô (560, Dixon J)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The extent to which the plaintiff must be ready, willing and able to perform depends upon the circumstances.

<li>Rawson v Hobbes (1961) 107 CLR 466
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòOne must be very careful to see that nothing but a substantial incapacity or definitive resolve or decision against doing in the future what the contract requires is counted as an absence of readiness and willingness.‚Äô (481, Dixon J)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Psaltis v Schultz (1948) 76 CLR 547
<ul>
<li>It is enough that he is not presently incapacitated from future performance and is not indisposed to do, when the time comes, what the contract requires.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Foran v Wight (1989) 168 CLR 385
<ul>
<li>Sellers repudiated (anticipatory breach) 2 days before settlement.</li>
<li>Purchasers waited for settlement ‚Äì neither parties attempted to settle.</li>
<li>Purchasers terminated for actual breach 2 days after settlement.</li>
<li>Sellers argued that plaintiffs were not ready, willing and able at the time the purchasers terminated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sharjade Pty Ltd v Commonwealth [2009] NSWCA 373
<ul>
<li>[68] As a matter of principle, it seems to me that the view of Deane J is preferable.</li>
<li>If the only question is whether a purported termination is effective to put an end to the contract so as to discharge both parties from future performance, then anticipatory breach by one will justify termination by the other whether or not the latter is ready and willing to perform.</li>
<li>However, if the latter wants to obtain any relief on the basis of the termination, beyond mere discharge of future obligations, then as part of its cause of action it must prove readiness, willingness and ability. (Hodgson JA, Young JA agreeing at [145])</li>
<li>A further and more difficult question is whether ‚Ä¶ a party who is also in breach of the contract ‚Ä¶ can terminate despite its own breach.
<ul>
<li>The answer is that generally it can, at least unless the obligations breached are interdependent or the breach by the party wishing to terminate has caused the breach that this party wishes to rely on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Foran v Wight (1989) 168 CLR 385
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThey were not required to show that upon the day stipulated for settlement they were ready and willing to tender the purchase price.</li>
<li>They were absolved from the obligation of placing themselves in a position to be able to tender the purchase price upon that day by reason of the representation of the vendors two days earlier.‚Äô (454, Dawson J)
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòAll that the purchasers were required to show was that at the time of the repudiation, that is, at the time they were absolved from future performance, there was not a ‚Äúsubstantial incapacity‚Äù on their part or a ‚Äúdefinitive resolve or decision‚Äù against the performance of their obligations.‚Äô (454, Dawson J)</li>

<li>Rescission: Restitutio in integrum
<ul>
<li>RESCISSION: INTERVENING THIRD PARTY
<ul>
<li>Focusing now on the right to rescind because of a vitiating factor, rescission will not be allowed if the parties cannot be restored to their pre-contractual positions.</li>
<li>Rescission:
<ul>
<li>Voids the contract.</li>
<li>Obliges the parties to restore each other to their pre- contractual positions.</li>
<li>If the parties cannot be restored, then rescission will be denied.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Example
<ul>
<li>Seller induces purchaser to buy a car with a fraudulent misrepresentation.</li>
<li>Purchaser paints the car a different colour and negligently damages it.</li>
<li>Purchaser discovers fraud.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rescission may be denied if purchaser cannot return the care in the same condition as it was transferred to them.</li>
<li>Contracts tainted by a vitiating factor are voidable, not void.
<ul>
<li>Voidable contracts allow title in property to pass, unless and until the contract is rescinded.</li>
<li>If the contract is not rescinded before that title is passed to an innocent third party, then the right to rescind is lost.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On rescission, ownership of property immediately reverts to original owner (plaintiff).
<ul>
<li>Plaintiff can get property from whomever has possession of it</li>

<li>Actions for debt def
<ul>
<li>When a party (the ‚Äòcontractor‚Äô) earns the right to payment for performance of an obligation.
<ul>
<li>When a contractor earns a right to payment under a contract, the contractor can sue for payment in an action called ‚Äòdebt‚Äô.</li>
<li>That right to payment exists independently of the contract, hence, if the contract is terminated after a right to payment has accrued, then the contractor can still sue on the debt owing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ACTIONS FOR DEBT
<ul>
<li>Contracts typically consist of the provision of goods/services for money.</li>
<li>A right to payment depends upon proper performance.</li>
<li>Construe the contract to determine:</li>
<li>Nature of obligations (entire? Divisible?)</li>
<li>Level of performance required (exact? Substantial?)</li>

<li>‚ÄòA debt recoverable under an indebitatus count was not and is not now conceived of simply as a cause of action for breach of duty or obligation.</li>
<li>In other words it is a mistake to regard the liability to pay a debt of a kind formerly recoverable in debt or indebitatus as no more than the result of a breach of contract, a breach which the creditor must affirmatively allege and prove.‚Äô (569, The Court)</li>

<p>SUMMARY</p>
<ul>
<li>Entire Contract vs Divisible Contract</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Payments independent of performance
<ul>
<li>Not all rights to payment depend upon the contractor first performing.
<ul>
<li>The parties are free to make payments independent of performance, and such payments are claimable as debts owing at the time(s) provided for in the contract.</li>
<li>A classic example of this is the deposit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>PAYMENTS INDEPENDENT OF PERFORMANCE
<ul>
<li>The right to payment does not have to depend on performance.</li>
<li>Parties can provide that payments are due at any time.</li>
<li>If so, the right to sue in debt arises on the arrival of the due date.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DEPOSITS
<ul>
<li>Howe v Smith (1884) 27 Ch D 89
<ul>
<li>‚Äô.. a deposit ‚Ä¶ is, according to the ordinary interpretation of business men, a security for the completion of the purchase.‚Äô (98, Bowen LJ)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bot v Ristevski [1981] VR 120
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòI prefer to approach the problem by asking whether an unconditional right to recover and retain the deposit arose before the contract was discharged.</li>
<li>If such a right did arise, it will survive the determination of the contract, and if the money has been paid before discharge the purchaser will not get it back, while if the money has not been paid before discharge the purchaser will be compelled to pay it.‚Äô (124-5, Brooking J)</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>INSTALMENTS
<ul>
<li>McDonald v Dennys Lascelles Ltd (1933) 48 CLR 457
<ul>
<li>Contract for the purchase of land by instalments.</li>
<li>Title transferred on payment of all instalments.
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòIn Reynolds v. Fury, the Full Court of Victoria, after a very full examination of the authorities, decided that instalments of purchase money, which, by the conditions of a contract of sale of land are payable at fixed times before conveyance, become immediately recoverable as debts or liquidated demands, notwithstanding that the sale has not yet been completed by conveyance.‚Äô (476, Dixon J)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>‚ÄòWhen a contract stipulates for payment of part of the purchase money in advance, the purchaser relying only on the vendor‚Äôs promise to give him a conveyance, the vendor is entitled to enforce payment before the time has arrived for conveying the land; yet his title to retain the money has been considered not to be absolute but conditional upon the subsequent completion of the contract.‚Äô (477, Dixon J)</li>

<li>
<p>Introduction to damages and specific performance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damages</p>
<ul>
<li>As foreshadowed in tutorial discussions, damagesLinks to an external site. are also available for breach of contract.</li>
<li>They are available for any breach; the right to them does not depend upon the classification of the term.</li>
<li>So, damages are available for breaches of ‚Äòmere‚Äô warranties.</li>
<li>Damages seek to provide a money equivalent of performance in place of the defective performance provided by the defendant.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specific performance</p>
<ul>
<li>Damages is the remedy provided by the common law.</li>
<li>Equity can also provide a remedy: specific performance.</li>
<li>It is also available to remedy an actual - or threatened - breach of contract.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>REMEDIES</p>
<ul>
<li>DAMAGES
<ul>
<li>GUIDING PRINCIPLE
<ul>
<li>Robinson v Harmon (1848) 154 ER 363
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe rule of the common law is, that where a party sustains a loss by reason of a breach of contract, he is, so far as money can do it, to be placed in the same situation, with respect to damages, as if the contract had been performed.‚Äô (365, Parke B)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>EXPECTATION DAMAGES
<ul>
<li>Commonwealth v Amann Aviation Pty Ltd (1992) 174 CLR 64
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe award of damages for breach of contract protects a plaintiff‚Äôs expectation of receiving the defendant‚Äôs performance.</li>
<li>the amount of damages awarded will be commensurate with the plaintiff‚Äôs expectation, objectively determined,</li>
<li>That is to say, a plaintiff must prove, on the balance of probabilities, that his or her expectation of a certain outcome, as a result of performance of the contract, had a likelihood of attainment rather than being mere expectation.‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ASSESSMENT OF DAMAGES
<ul>
<li>Moore v Scenic Tours Pty Ltd [2020] HCA 17
<ul>
<li>[64] ‚Ä¶ a fundamental difference between two components of compensatory damages for breach of contract,</li>
<li>Those components are compensation directly for the performance interest and compensation for consequential losses</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Example 1
<ul>
<li>Purchaser agrees to buy good for $10,000.</li>
<li>On date of delivery, purchaser breaches the contract by refusing to take and pay for the good.</li>
<li>On the date of breach, the market value of the good is $9,000.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Example 1: Assessment
<ul>
<li>Expectation interest is compensated by awarding $1,000.</li>
<li>This puts the seller in the position that they would have been in had the contract been performed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Example 2
<ul>
<li>Purchaser agrees to buy good for $10,000.</li>
<li>On date of delivery, purchaser breaches the contract by refusing to take and pay for the good.</li>
<li>On the date of breach, the market value of the good is $9,000.</li>
<li>Purchaser spends $250 storing the good before selling it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Example 2: Assessment
<ul>
<li>Expectation interest: $1,000; and</li>
<li>Consequential loss: $250</li>
<li>This puts the seller in the position that they would have been in had the contract been performed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CAUSATION
<ul>
<li>The plaintiff must show that the loss that they are claiming for was caused by the breach of contract.</li>
<li>March v E &amp; MH Stramare (1991) 171 CLR 506
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòThe common law tradition is that what was the cause of a particular occurrence is a question of fact which ‚Äúmust be determined by applying common sense to the facts of each particular case‚Äù ‚Ä¶‚Äô (Mason CJ)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>REMOTENESS
<ul>
<li>Even if the plaintiff proves that loss was caused by a breach of contract, then the defendant will not be liable if the loss is too remote.</li>
<li>Test: ‚Äòreasonable contemplation‚Äô test.</li>
<li>Hadley v Baxendale (1854) 156 ER 145
<ul>
<li>fairly and reasonably be considered arising naturally, that is, according to the usual course of things, from such breach of contract itself, or such as may reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties at the time they made the contract,</li>
<li>If special circumstances under which the contract was actually made were communicated by the plaintiffs to the defendants, and thus known to both parties, the damages resulting from the breach of such a contract, which they would reasonably contemplate, would be the amount of injury which would ordinarily follow from a breach of contract under these special circumstances so known and communicated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CONCLUSION
<ul>
<li>The point of damages is to put the plaintiff into the position that they would have been in had the contract been performed.</li>

<p>BAILMENT</p>
<ul>
<li>Hobbs v Petersham Transport Co Pty Ltd (1971) 124 CLR 220
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòA bailment comes into existence upon the delivery of goods of one person, the bailor, into the possession of another person, the bailee, upon a promise, express or implied, that they will be redelivered to the bailor or dealt with in a stipulated way.‚Äô (238, Windeyer J)</li>

<li>
<p>Morris v C W Martin &amp; Sons Ltd [1966] 1 QB 716</p>
<ul>
<li>‚ÄúOnce a man has taken charge of goods as a bailee for reward, it is his duty to take reasonable care to keep them safe:
<ul>
<li>and he cannot escape that duty be delegating it to his servant.
<ul>
<li>If the goods are lost or damaged, whilst they are in his possession, he is liable unless he can show - and the burden is on him to show - that the loss or damage occurred without any neglect or default or misconduct of himself or of any of the servants to whom he delegated his duty.‚Äù</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>City of Sydney v West (1965) 114 CLR 481</p>
<ul>
<li>‚ÄúBut in the present case what is important, I think, is to recognize that the evident purpose of the clause is to free the appellant from all the responsibility (for loss and damage) to which otherwise its assumption of the position of bailee would have subjected it.</li>
<li>The clause is part and parcel of the bargain by which the bailment was created and the reciprocal rights and obligations of the parties as bailor and bailee were regulated.
<ul>
<li>The concern of the clause, as read in the setting in which it came to be agreed upon (assuming that it was agreed upon), was with the legal responsibility which the appellant‚Äôs acceptance of the bailment should entail.‚Äù</li>

<p>CONTRACTS REVIEW ACT 1980 (NSW)</p>
<ul>
<li>West v AGC (Advances) Ltd (1986) 5 NSWLR 610
<ul>
<li>‚ÄúThe Contracts Review Act 1980 is revolutionary legislation whose evident purpose is to overcome the common law‚Äôs failure to provide a comprehensive doctrinal framework to deal with ‚Äòunjust‚Äô contracts.‚Äù (621, McHugh JA)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd v Khoshaba [2006] NSWCA 41 [115] ‚Ä¶
<ul>
<li>Thus, while equity provides relief against the unconscientious conduct of the defendant, the Act may permit relief in circumstances where the conscience of the defendant is not affected.</li>
<li>Similarly, a contract, or a provision thereof, may be unjust in circumstances where there was no pre-existing duty owed by, say, a lender to a borrower to act in a particular way. (Basten JA)</li>
