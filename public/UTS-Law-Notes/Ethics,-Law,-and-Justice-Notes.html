</li>
<li>Question of whether sentencing court should consider and respond to the interests and concerns of  both the defendant and the victim.</li>
<li>Sentencing Act 1991 (Vic)
<ul>
<li>members of the deceased‚Äôs family submit VIS providing details of impact loss or damage caused
<ul>
<li>Used to assist the court in determining sentence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Three issues for Public in trial
<ul>
<li>the  contentious nature of the VISs</li>
<li>lack of notice and preparation for the objections</li>
<li>treatment of the family victims in the process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dawlan
<ul>
<li>Making rulings with respect to each part of the statements subject to objection not necessary</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Weird trial practices
<ul>
<li>Typically ask judges to disregard instead of object, but not the case here
<ul>
<li>Also warn barrister beforehand so they know (very casual)
<ul>
<li>Didn‚Äôt happen</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Actually live edited the VIS without family input,
<ul>
<li>Took so long court adjourned</li>
<li>No justification to what was cut out</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Separated defendant and victim families</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Courts fixed these issues in May 2011 in ‚Äòpractice direction‚Äô
<ul>
<li>Impact on the conduct of plea
<ul>
<li>Request a preliminary hearing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Did not address inter-personal treatment of victims in the courtroom</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Victim family are nonparties
<ul>
<li>Fairness required the court to respond empathically to their situation and acknowledge their emotional responses to court events.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Conclusion - Opinion
<ul>
<li>Protect both defendant and accommodate victim both, not just one or another</li>
<li>courts will need to be dynamic,  adaptive, and  reflective</li>

<li>For Rawls in book A Theory of Justice
<ul>
<li>Justice requires an impartial distribution of resources and opportunities</li>
<li>Potentially slavery is beneficial to the good of the community, if following strict utilitarianism, you might be a slave yourself
<ul>
<li>May not always be the best option</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>His solution
<ul>
<li>Each person is free to do as they choose if they do not infringe on basic freedoms of others</li>
<li>If there are social and economic inequalities, the should be both to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged and attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality and opportunity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Liberties are distributed equally, while social and economic goods are not completely.</li>
<li>Nozick argues if a car was legitimately sold to you, any redistribution of your vehicle to the greater good is theft, while under Rawls, car owners would pay a tax to support public transportation</li>

<li>Ethics, Values, and Professionalism
<ul>
<li>Ethics
<ul>
<li>moral philosophy or moral principles adopted as a code or framework of behavior in a particular context</li>
<li>Moral values can differ more or less significantly between cultures, and within particular societies</li>
<li>Choose the values that are meaningful
<ul>
<li>Answering a practical question - what should I do</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the development of the law has been influenced by ethics, but ethics is not derived from law;</li>
<li>the reasons for significant laws governing human beings and their institutions (criminal laws, laws about the incorporation of business or protecting the environment) are overwhelmingly ethical reasons;
<ul>
<li>law is commonly a public expression of, and sanction for, the morality of a given society;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the law should be continually subject to the scrutiny of ethical critique</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>professional responsibility framework
<ul>
<li>set of duties owed bythe legal practitioner to each of the client, the court and the administration of justice, and to other practitione</li>
<li>Lawyers first duty is to court and to justice</li>
<li>Leges sine moribus vanae:
<ul>
<li>effective laws need the supportof everydaypracticeand belief</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ross different law models
<ul>
<li>lawyer-control model - the lawyer‚Äôs knowledge and training means that they know what is best for the client and expect the client to follow their advice;</li>
<li>client-control model - the lawyer provides the technical advice and the client makes the decisions for the lawyer to carry out, be they ethical or not;</li>
<li>Cooperative model - a largely relational model where the lawyer and client work together, based on communication, discussion and agreementon the decisions to be taken.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Parker and evans four main strands of ethical reasoning
<ul>
<li>Adversarial advocacy  - the requirement for lawyers to advocate on their client‚Äôs behalf within the bounds of the law, regardless of outcome or effect on others;</li>
<li>The responsible lawyer - who accepts that, as an officer of the court, there is also an obligation to facilitate the administration of justice;</li>
<li>moral activism - taking the opportunity to improve justice through law reform, public interest law, and client counseling; and an ethics of care -
<ul>
<li>an approach to practice that is about preserving relationships with clients, between parties, and within communities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Professional identity consists of three elements:
<ul>
<li>your personal identity;</li>
<li>The role identity (of being a lawyer);</li>
<li>and the social identity of your profession</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Virtue ethics
<ul>
<li>development of moral character and the virtues that a person should cultivate to lead a good life.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Deontological ethics
<ul>
<li>Duty based ethics</li>
<li>individuals have a moral obligation to follow these rules and principles, even if doing so may lead to less favorable outcomes.</li>

<li>Ascertain the material facts
<ul>
<li>Cave explorers got trapped, difficult to rescue took 32 days</li>
<li>Physicians told stuck that they would not survive</li>
<li>No one would answer whether they would survive if they ate a member of party
<ul>
<li>Stuck men did eat whetmore (asking questions)</li>
<li>He proposed eating someone and dice</li>
<li>Lost the throw after chickening out (someone threw for him)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Society has law that take life willingly is hanged, but sympathy is allowed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>State the issue raised by the material facts and how the court answered it (theresult of the case
<ul>
<li>Should the men who killed Roger Whetmore hang as law dictates even through a survival situation</li>
<li>N. C.  S. A. ( N. S. ) ¬ß 12-A, willfully take the life of Roger Whetmore.

<li>The  proposition  that  all  positive  law  is  based  on  the possibility of men‚Äôs  coexistence</li>
<li>When the assumption that men may live together loses its  truth,  as  it  obviously  did  in  this  extraordinary situation where life only  became  possible  by  the  taking  of  life,  then  the basic premises underlying our whole legal order have lost their meaning and force.

<li>Men were not physically nor mentally bound by law of the nation that they were not apart of at the time (covered by tons of rock and removed from society, state of nature)</li>
<li>They were their own government</li>

<li>Rehabilitation of the wrongdoer</li>

<li>Murder is done willfully, while self-defense is instinctual</li>

<li>Duty of Loyalty
<ul>
<li>a duty to act in good faith, a duty of confidentiality (rule 9) and a duty to avoid conflict with the interests of the client.</li>

<li>Good Faith
<ul>
<li>Fiduciary Law = act in good fath, often beyond retainer wording</li>
<li>Conflict of interest ASCR = rules 10-12</li>
<li>Law Society of New South Wales v Harvey
<ul>
<li>the duty to act in good faith elements:
<ul>
<li>the lawyer must not permit their own interests to override those of the client
<ul>
<li>the client‚Äôs interests are paramount;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the nature of the lawyer‚Äôs interest must be fully disclosed to the client;</li>
<li>Where a conflict of interest can be avoided, it should be avoided;
<ul>
<li>where a conflict of interest nevertheless remains, the lawyer should advise the client to obtain independent legal advice,</li>
<li>or consider withdrawing from the transaction; and the lawyer‚Äôs interests have the potential to abuse the client‚Äôs position</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Practitioner acts honestly and with diligence</li>

<li>imminent serious physical harm to the client or to another person;or</li>
<li>the information is disclosed to the insurer of the solicitor, law practice or associated entity.‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>s 316(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) provides that it is an offense for a person with knowledge or belief of the commission of a serious indictable offense by another and who has information that may be of material assistance to the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of the offender to fail without reasonable excuse to pass that information on to the police or relevant authorities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Where a client communicates to a lawyer an intention to breach a court order
<ul>
<li>advise the client against that course and warn the client of its dangers;</li>
<li>not advise the client how to carry out or conceal that course;</li>
<li>not inform the court or the opponent of the client‚Äôs intention unless:

<li>Victim impact statement
<ul>
<li>VIS</li>
<li>Used in sentencing
<ul>
<li>Provide victims with a voice in the hearing</li>
<li>Expression space of impact</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question of whether sentencing court should consider and respond to the interests and concerns of  both the defendant and the victim.</li>
<li>Sentencing Act 1991 (Vic)
<ul>
<li>members of the deceased‚Äôs family submit VIS providing details of impact loss or damage caused
<ul>
<li>Used to assist the court in determining sentence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Three issues for Public in trial
<ul>
<li>the  contentious nature of the VISs</li>
<li>lack of notice and preparation for the objections</li>
<li>treatment of the family victims in the process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dawlan
<ul>
<li>Making rulings with respect to each part of the statements subject to objection not necessary</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Weird trial practices
<ul>
<li>Typically ask judges to disregard instead of object, but not the case here
<ul>
<li>Also warn barrister beforehand so they know (very casual)
<ul>
<li>Didn‚Äôt happen</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Actually live edited the VIS without family input,
<ul>
<li>Took so long court adjourned</li>
<li>No justification to what was cut out</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Separated defendant and victim families</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Courts fixed these issues in May 2011 in ‚Äòpractice direction‚Äô
<ul>
<li>Impact on the conduct of plea
<ul>
<li>Request a preliminary hearing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Did not address inter-personal treatment of victims in the courtroom</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Victim family are nonparties
<ul>
<li>Fairness required the court to respond empathically to their situation and acknowledge their emotional responses to court events.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Conclusion - Opinion
<ul>
<li>Protect both defendant and accommodate victim both, not just one or another</li>
<li>courts will need to be dynamic,  adaptive, and  reflective</li>

<li>For Rawls in book A Theory of Justice
<ul>
<li>Justice requires an impartial distribution of resources and opportunities</li>
<li>Potentially slavery is beneficial to the good of the community, if following strict utilitarianism, you might be a slave yourself
<ul>
<li>May not always be the best option</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>His solution
<ul>
<li>Each person is free to do as they choose if they do not infringe on basic freedoms of others</li>
<li>If there are social and economic inequalities, the should be both to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged and attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality and opportunity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Liberties are distributed equally, while social and economic goods are not completely.</li>
<li>Nozick argues if a car was legitimately sold to you, any redistribution of your vehicle to the greater good is theft, while under Rawls, car owners would pay a tax to support public transportation</li>

<p>Ethics, Values, and Professionalism</p>
<ul>
<li>Ethics
<ul>
<li>moral philosophy or moral principles adopted as a code or framework of behavior in a particular context</li>
<li>Moral values can differ more or less significantly between cultures, and within particular societies</li>
<li>Choose the values that are meaningful
<ul>
<li>Answering a practical question - what should I do</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the development of the law has been influenced by ethics, but ethics is not derived from law;</li>
<li>the reasons for significant laws governing human beings and their institutions (criminal laws, laws about the incorporation of business or protecting the environment) are overwhelmingly ethical reasons;
<ul>
<li>law is commonly a public expression of, and sanction for, the morality of a given society;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the law should be continually subject to the scrutiny of ethical critique</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>professional responsibility framework
<ul>
<li>set of duties owed bythe legal practitioner to each of the client, the court and the administration of justice, and to other practitione</li>
<li>Lawyers first duty is to court and to justice</li>
<li>Leges sine moribus vanae:
<ul>
<li>effective laws need the supportof everydaypracticeand belief</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ross different law models
<ul>
<li>lawyer-control model - the lawyer‚Äôs knowledge and training means that they know what is best for the client and expect the client to follow their advice;</li>
<li>client-control model - the lawyer provides the technical advice and the client makes the decisions for the lawyer to carry out, be they ethical or not;</li>
<li>Cooperative model - a largely relational model where the lawyer and client work together, based on communication, discussion and agreementon the decisions to be taken.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Parker and evans four main strands of ethical reasoning
<ul>
<li>Adversarial advocacy  - the requirement for lawyers to advocate on their client‚Äôs behalf within the bounds of the law, regardless of outcome or effect on others;</li>
<li>The responsible lawyer - who accepts that, as an officer of the court, there is also an obligation to facilitate the administration of justice;</li>
<li>moral activism - taking the opportunity to improve justice through law reform, public interest law, and client counseling; and an ethics of care -
<ul>
<li>an approach to practice that is about preserving relationships with clients, between parties, and within communities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Professional identity consists of three elements:
<ul>
<li>your personal identity;</li>
<li>The role identity (of being a lawyer);</li>
<li>and the social identity of your profession</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Virtue ethics
<ul>
<li>development of moral character and the virtues that a person should cultivate to lead a good life.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Deontological ethics
<ul>
<li>Duty based ethics</li>
<li>individuals have a moral obligation to follow these rules and principles, even if doing so may lead to less favorable outcomes.</li>

<ul>
<li>Note the name of the case and its citation
<ul>
<li>THE CASE OF THE SPELUNCEAN EXPLORERS, SUPREME COURT OF NEWGARTH, 4300</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Clarify the procedural history of the case.
<ul>
<li>Court  of  General Instances  of  the  County  of  Stowfield
<ul>
<li>Sentenced to hang</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ascertain the material facts
<ul>
<li>Cave explorers got trapped, difficult to rescue took 32 days</li>
<li>Physicians told stuck that they would not survive</li>
<li>No one would answer whether they would survive if they ate a member of party
<ul>
<li>Stuck men did eat whetmore (asking questions)</li>
<li>He proposed eating someone and dice</li>
<li>Lost the throw after chickening out (someone threw for him)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Society has law that take life willingly is hanged, but sympathy is allowed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>State the issue raised by the material facts and how the court answered it (theresult of the case
<ul>
<li>Should the men who killed Roger Whetmore hang as law dictates even through a survival situation</li>
<li>N. C.  S. A. ( N. S. ) ¬ß 12-A, willfully take the life of Roger Whetmore.
<ul>
<li>‚ÄúWhoever  shall  willfully  take  the  life  of  another  shall  be punished by death.‚Äù</li>

<li>Foster J
<ul>
<li>The  proposition  that  all  positive  law  is  based  on  the possibility of men‚Äôs  coexistence</li>
<li>When the assumption that men may live together loses its  truth,  as  it  obviously  did  in  this  extraordinary situation where life only  became  possible  by  the  taking  of  life,  then  the basic premises underlying our whole legal order have lost their meaning and force.
<ul>
<li>Men were not physically nor mentally bound by law of the nation that they were not apart of at the time (covered by tons of rock and removed from society, state of nature)</li>
<li>They were their own government</li>
<li>10 construction workers were acceptably killed to save 5, but they cannot kill 1 to save the other 4 voluntarily</li>
<li>Set aside</li>

</li>
<li>Tatting J
<ul>
<li>If Whetmore shot him, it would be as if a prisoner shot a hangman, not self-defense</li>
<li>Law should be applied in light of its purpose but other precedent shows it also is for
<ul>
<li>Retribution</li>
<li>Rehabilitation of the wrongdoer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Murder is done willfully, while self-defense is instinctual</li>
<li>Court has held that stealing bread due to hunger is not a valid defense
<ul>
<li>So how can killing a man be justified</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Even if valid, how is the selection process decided (only one afterlife believer should die?)</li>

<li>Typically ask judges to disregard instead of object, but not the case here
<ul>
<li>Also warn barrister beforehand so they know (very casual)

<li>For Rawls in book A Theory of Justice

<li>Justice requires an impartial distribution of resources and opportunities</li>
<li>Potentially slavery is beneficial to the good of the community, if following strict utilitarianism, you might be a slave yourself
<ul>
<li>May not always be the best option</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>His solution
<ul>
<li>Each person is free to do as they choose if they do not infringe on basic freedoms of others</li>
<li>If there are social and economic inequalities, the should be both to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged and attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality and opportunity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Liberties are distributed equally, while social and economic goods are not completely.</li>

<li>the development of the law has been influenced by ethics, but ethics is not derived from law;</li>
<li>the reasons for significant laws governing human beings and their institutions (criminal laws, laws about the incorporation of business or protecting the environment) are overwhelmingly ethical reasons;
<ul>
<li>law is commonly a public expression of, and sanction for, the morality of a given society;</li>

<li>Stuck men did eat whetmore (asking questions)</li>
<li>He proposed eating someone and dice</li>
<li>Lost the throw after chickening out (someone threw for him)</li>

</li>
<li>Society has law that take life willingly is hanged, but sympathy is allowed</li>

<li>Should the men who killed Roger Whetmore hang as law dictates even through a survival situation</li>

<li>the nature of the lawyer‚Äôs interest must be fully disclosed to the client;</li>
<li>Where a conflict of interest can be avoided, it should be avoided;
