  - Victim impact statement 
    - VIS
    - Used in sentencing
      - Provide victims with a voice in the hearing
      - Expression space of impact
    - Question of whether sentencing court should consider and respond to the interests and concerns of  both the defendant and the victim.
    - Sentencing Act 1991 (Vic) 
      - members of the deceased's family submit VIS providing details of impact loss or damage caused
        - Used to assist the court in determining sentence.
  - Three issues for Public in trial
    - the  contentious nature of the VISs
    - lack of notice and preparation for the objections 
    -  treatment of the family victims in the process.
  - Dawlan 
    - Making rulings with respect to each part of the statements subject to objection not necessary
  - Weird trial practices
    - Typically ask judges to disregard instead of object, but not the case here
      - Also warn barrister beforehand so they know (very casual)
        - Didn't happen
      - Actually live edited the VIS without family input,
        - Took so long court adjourned
        - No justification to what was cut out
      - Separated defendant and victim families
    - Courts fixed these issues in May 2011 in 'practice direction'
      - Impact on the conduct of plea
        - Request a preliminary hearing
      - Did not address inter-personal treatment of victims in the courtroom
    - Victim family are nonparties
      - Fairness required the court to respond empathically to their situation and acknowledge their emotional responses to court events.
    - Conclusion - Opinion
      - Protect both defendant and accommodate victim both, not just one or another
      - courts will need to be dynamic,  adaptive, and  reflective

      - Cooperative model - a largely relational model where the lawyer and client work together, based on communication, discussion and agreementon the decisions to be taken.
    - Parker and evans four main strands of ethical reasoning
      - Adversarial advocacy  - the requirement for lawyers to advocate on their client's behalf within the bounds of the law, regardless of outcome or effect on others;

      - moral activism - taking the opportunity to improve justice through law reform, public interest law, and client counseling; and an ethics of care - 
        - an approach to practice that is about preserving relationships with clients, between parties, and within communities.

  - Clarify the procedural history of the case. 
    - Court  of  General Instances  of  the  County  of  Stowfield
      - Sentenced to hang
  - Ascertain the material facts
    - Cave explorers got trapped, difficult to rescue took 32 days
    - Physicians told stuck that they would not survive
    - No one would answer whether they would survive if they ate a member of party
      - Stuck men did eat whetmore (asking questions)
      - He proposed eating someone and dice
      - Lost the throw after chickening out (someone threw for him)
    - Society has law that take life willingly is hanged, but sympathy is allowed
  - State the issue raised by the material facts and how the court answered it (theresult of the case
    - Should the men who killed Roger Whetmore hang as law dictates even through a survival situation
    - N. C.  S. A. ( N. S. ) Â§ 12-A, willfully take the life of Roger Whetmore.
      - "Whoever  shall  willfully  take  the  life  of  another  shall  be punished by death."

    - Truepenny C.J
      - Withheld 
    - Foster J
      - The  proposition  that  all  positive  law  is  based  on  the possibility of men's  coexistence
      - When the assumption that men may live together loses its  truth,  as  it  obviously  did  in  this  extraordinary situation where life only  became  possible  by  the  taking  of  life,  then  the basic premises underlying our whole legal order have lost their meaning and force.

        - Rehabilitation of the wrongdoer
      - Murder is done willfully, while self-defense is instinctual
      - Court has held that stealing bread due to hunger is not a valid defense
        - So how can killing a man be justified
      - Even if valid, how is the selection process decided (only one afterlife believer should die?)

      - Did he revoke his offer prior to action taken
      - 90% of public and 90% of judges want to pardon or token punish, so that's what it should be
        - With reason as public is crazy
      - Chief Justice proposes that court sentences them to be hanged but another branch pardons them to preserve the integrity of law

    - Question of whether sentencing court should consider and respond to the interests and concerns of  both the defendant and the victim.
    - Sentencing Act 1991 (Vic) 
      - members of the deceased's family submit VIS providing details of impact loss or damage caused
        - Used to assist the court in determining sentence.
  - Three issues for Public in trial
    - the  contentious nature of the VISs
    - lack of notice and preparation for the objections 
    -  treatment of the family victims in the process.
  - Dawlan 
    - Making rulings with respect to each part of the statements subject to objection not necessary
  - Weird trial practices
    - Typically ask judges to disregard instead of object, but not the case here
      - Also warn barrister beforehand so they know (very casual)
        - Didn't happen
      - Actually live edited the VIS without family input,
        - Took so long court adjourned
        - No justification to what was cut out
      - Separated defendant and victim families
    - Courts fixed these issues in May 2011 in 'practice direction'
      - Impact on the conduct of plea
        - Request a preliminary hearing
      - Did not address inter-personal treatment of victims in the courtroom
    - Victim family are nonparties
      - Fairness required the court to respond empathically to their situation and acknowledge their emotional responses to court events.
    - Conclusion - Opinion
      - Protect both defendant and accommodate victim both, not just one or another
      - courts will need to be dynamic,  adaptive, and  reflective

      - Cooperative model - a largely relational model where the lawyer and client work together, based on communication, discussion and agreementon the decisions to be taken.

      - Adversarial advocacy  - the requirement for lawyers to advocate on their client's behalf within the bounds of the law, regardless of outcome or effect on others;

      - moral activism - taking the opportunity to improve justice through law reform, public interest law, and client counseling; and an ethics of care - 
        - an approach to practice that is about preserving relationships with clients, between parties, and within communities.

  - Clarify the procedural history of the case. 
    - Court  of  General Instances  of  the  County  of  Stowfield
      - Sentenced to hang
  - Ascertain the material facts
    - Cave explorers got trapped, difficult to rescue took 32 days
    - Physicians told stuck that they would not survive
    - No one would answer whether they would survive if they ate a member of party
      - Stuck men did eat whetmore (asking questions)
      - He proposed eating someone and dice
      - Lost the throw after chickening out (someone threw for him)
    - Society has law that take life willingly is hanged, but sympathy is allowed
  - State the issue raised by the material facts and how the court answered it (theresult of the case
    - Should the men who killed Roger Whetmore hang as law dictates even through a survival situation
    - N. C.  S. A. ( N. S. ) Â§ 12-A, willfully take the life of Roger Whetmore.
      - "Whoever  shall  willfully  take  the  life  of  another  shall  be punished by death."
  - Identify the reasoning which supported the decision and the ratio of the case.
    - Truepenny C.J
      - Withheld 
    - Foster J
      - The  proposition  that  all  positive  law  is  based  on  the possibility of men's  coexistence
      - When the assumption that men may live together loses its  truth,  as  it  obviously  did  in  this  extraordinary situation where life only  became  possible  by  the  taking  of  life,  then  the basic premises underlying our whole legal order have lost their meaning and force.

        - Rehabilitation of the wrongdoer
      - Murder is done willfully, while self-defense is instinctual
      - Court has held that stealing bread due to hunger is not a valid defense
        - So how can killing a man be justified
      - Even if valid, how is the selection process decided (only one afterlife believer should die?)

      - Affirmed
    - Handy, J
      - Was it a unilateral or bilateral bargain in the cave
      - Did he revoke his offer prior to action taken
      - 90% of public and 90% of judges want to pardon or token punish, so that's what it should be
        - With reason as public is crazy
      - Chief Justice proposes that court sentences them to be hanged but another branch pardons them to preserve the integrity of law

  - Victim impact statement 
    - VIS
    - Used in sentencing
      - Provide victims with a voice in the hearing
      - Expression space of impact
    - Question of whether sentencing court should consider and respond to the interests and concerns of  both the defendant and the victim.
    - Sentencing Act 1991 (Vic) 
      - members of the deceased's family submit VIS providing details of impact loss or damage caused
        - Used to assist the court in determining sentence.
  - Three issues for Public in trial
    - the  contentious nature of the VISs
    - lack of notice and preparation for the objections 
    -  treatment of the family victims in the process.
  - Dawlan 
    - Making rulings with respect to each part of the statements subject to objection not necessary
  - Weird trial practices
    - Typically ask judges to disregard instead of object, but not the case here
      - Also warn barrister beforehand so they know (very casual)
        - Didn't happen
      - Actually live edited the VIS without family input,
        - Took so long court adjourned
        - No justification to what was cut out
      - Separated defendant and victim families
    - Courts fixed these issues in May 2011 in 'practice direction'
      - Impact on the conduct of plea
        - Request a preliminary hearing
      - Did not address inter-personal treatment of victims in the courtroom

  - Ascertain the material facts
    - Cave explorers got trapped, difficult to rescue took 32 days
    - Physicians told stuck that they would not survive
    - No one would answer whether they would survive if they ate a member of party
      - Stuck men did eat whetmore (asking questions)
      - He proposed eating someone and dice
      - Lost the throw after chickening out (someone threw for him)
    - Society has law that take life willingly is hanged, but sympathy is allowed

    - Should the men who killed Roger Whetmore hang as law dictates even through a survival situation
    - N. C.  S. A. ( N. S. ) Â§ 12-A, willfully take the life of Roger Whetmore.
      - "Whoever  shall  willfully  take  the  life  of  another  shall  be punished by death."
  - Identify the reasoning which supported the decision and the ratio of the case.
    - Truepenny C.J
      - Withheld 
    - Foster J
      - The  proposition  that  all  positive  law  is  based  on  the possibility of men's  coexistence
      - When the assumption that men may live together loses its  truth,  as  it  obviously  did  in  this  extraordinary situation where life only  became  possible  by  the  taking  of  life,  then  the basic premises underlying our whole legal order have lost their meaning and force.

      - Murder is done willfully, while self-defense is instinctual
      - Court has held that stealing bread due to hunger is not a valid defense

      - Affirmed
    - Handy, J
      - Was it a unilateral or bilateral bargain in the cave
      - Did he revoke his offer prior to action taken
      - 90% of public and 90% of judges want to pardon or token punish, so that's what it should be
        - With reason as public is crazy
      - Chief Justice proposes that court sentences them to be hanged but another branch pardons them to preserve the integrity of law

        - the duty to act in good faith elements:
          - the lawyer must not permit their own interests to override those of the client 
            - the client's interests are paramount;
          - the nature of the lawyer's interest must be fully disclosed to the client;
          - Where a conflict of interest can be avoided, it should be avoided;
            - where a conflict of interest nevertheless remains, the lawyer should advise the client to obtain independent legal advice,
            - or consider withdrawing from the transaction; and the lawyer's interests have the potential to abuse the client's position
