<li>Clarify the procedural history of the case.</li>
<li>What the original dispute was</li>
<li>Current reason for trial</li>
<li>Ascertain the material facts</li>
<li>State the issue raised by the material facts
<ul>
<li>Law(s)/Statue(s) in contention</li>
<li>Precedences</li>
<li>Tests</li>
<li>Words and Phrases Considered</li>
<li>Arguments made by each side
<ul>
<li>Plaintiff/Prosecution</li>
<li>Defense</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What each judge thought</li>
<li>Obiter</li>
<li>Identify the legal reasoning and the ratio of the case.</li>
<li>Result</li>

<p>Example</p>
<ul>
<li>Note the name of the case and its citation
<ul>
<li>Clark v Malpas (1862) 31 Beav 80; 54 ER 1067</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Clarify the procedural history of the case.
<ul>
<li>No procedural history</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ascertain the material facts
<ul>
<li>In Clark v Malpas,the material facts relate to
<ul>
<li>the vendor‚Äôs personal circumstances (old,seriously ill, illiterate),</li>
<li>the value of the property(about√Ç¬£380), the price actually paid</li>
<li>100 to heir plus 12s (shillings) per week and free rent for life)</li>
<li>and the circumstances in which the transaction occurred
<ul>
<li>(the purchaser knew that the vendor was ill, the vendor had no independent advice, the transaction was completed very quickly and the vendor died soon afterward</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>State the issue raised by the material facts and how the court answered it (the result of the case)
<ul>
<li>In Clark v Malpas, the facts raised this issue:
<ul>
<li>is it fair for a party to retain the benefit of a bargain where the contract is hastily executed and the other party is a sick old man who received no independent advice and inadequate consideration?
<ul>
<li>And the court‚Äôs answer? No</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Identify the reasoning which supported the decision and the ratio of the case.
<ul>
<li>In this case it‚Äôs facts, so not much ratio (mostly appellate has ratio)</li>
<li>Defendant used precedent that was distinguished by judge due to material difference
<ul>
<li>Previous case gave seller time to move deliberately into transaction</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Example ratio: where the sale of property is for a very inadequate consideration and the circumstances establish that the vendor requires the protection of the law,
<ul>
<li>the burden is on the purchaser to prove that the transaction was entered into carefully, deliberately and with full knowledge</li>

<ul>
<li>Held that the 1987 legislation and the corporations law cross-vesting scheme were invalid to the extent that they purported to confer state jurisdiction on federal courts.</li>
<li>state could not refer power to a federal court, and it established that the Federal Court(s) cannot hear matters whose only jurisdiction is cross-vested state jurisdiction.</li>

<li>Burden of proof
The judges in the earlier court cases, R v Murrell and R v Bonjon, assume that colonial legal rule is superior and intended for the benefit of white settlers, with little consideration for the rights and interests of First Nations Australians. In contrast, the judgments in Mabo v Queensland (No 2), Love v Commonwealth of Australia; Thoms v Commonwealth of Australia, Walker v New South Wales, and Wik Peoples v Queensland recognize the significance of Indigenous land rights and reject the idea of terra nullius, acknowledging that colonial legal rule has historically marginalized and disadvantaged First Nations Australians. These later judgments suggest a shift towards a more equitable and inclusive legal system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Privy Council = an advisory body to the British monarch and the court of final appeal in the United Kingdom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reception = the implementation of the colonial nation‚Äôs laws after occupation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Terra nullius = Latin for land belonging to no one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Westminster system = the British system of representative government, consisting of three arms of government: the courts (judicature), parliament (legislature) and executive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customary laws system =  law passed down through the generations by oral tradition (storytelling).</p>
<ul>
<li>Heterogeneous</li>
<li>R v Murrell.
<ul>
<li>Murrell argued that the judgment of the Supreme Court on the alleged murder could not be handed down, as judgment could only be handed down by Jabbingee‚Äôs family.</li>
<li>New South Wales was neither conquered, ceded, nor a British settlement by occupation. Thus, the Aboriginal people were not bound by English criminal laws in New South Wales. Only the Britons were bound by these laws. The sole exception was where laws ‚Äòprotected‚Äô Aboriginal people‚Äîthis was premised on a contract theory of government: that the right to govern and impose laws on the people was granted in return for their protection.</li>
<li>‚Ä¢Aboriginal people had no recognisable laws, but only ‚Äòpractices‚Äô that ‚Äòare consistent with a state of the grossest darkness and irrational superstition‚Äô. These ‚Äòare founded entirely upon principles ‚Ä¶ of vindication for personal wrongs‚Äô and ‚Äòthe wildest most indiscriminatory notions of revenge‚Äô. Thus, Aboriginal people are not ‚Äòentitled to be recognised as ‚Ä¶ sovereign states governed by laws of their own‚Äô.</li>
<li>Every First Nations person born in Australia after 1829 became a British subject‚Äîalthough not by their own choosing, or necessarily to their benefit (R v Murrell</li>

<li>Law Reform Commission of Western Australia identified among Western Australian First Nations societies ‚Äòa defined system of rules for the regulation of human behaviour which has developed over many years from a foundation of moral norms and which attracts specific sanctions for noncompliance‚Äô.</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Occupation</p>
<ul>
<li>it allowed for the automatic reception of English laws, without the need to negotiate a treaty and concede limitations on colonial jurisdiction. The logic behind occupation is that the colonised territory does not have a pre-existing legal system that the colonising nation has to adopt or negotiate with.</li>

<p>The international law doctrine of terra nullius‚Äîa colony ‚Äòwithout settled inhabitants or settled law‚Äô‚Äîwas confirmed in New South Wales in Cooper v Stuart (1889)</p>
<ul>
<li>Mabo v Queensland [No 2] (1992) 175 CLR 126
<ul>
<li>Dispels terra nullius</li>
<li>High Court in Mabo (1992) held that, while in 1788 the Crown acquired radical (absolute) title, it did not become the owner of all land.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>R v Bonjon (1841) recognised the possibility of the coexisting application of First Nations laws with Anglo-Australian laws</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Walker v New South Wales in 1994</p>
<ul>
<li>High Court held that the jurisdiction of the Anglo-Australian criminal law could not be challenged by First Nations laws</li>
<li>The judgment in R v Bonjon (see above) is an example of New South Wales Supreme Court Judge Willis‚Äô refusal to accept the universality of English laws.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Governor Bourke issued a proclamation that the British Crown was the owner of all Australian territory and solely capable of distributing the land, which the British Colonial Office affirmed on 10 October 1835.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Australian Courts Act 1828 (UK) was the statutory instrument for the formal reception of English law.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pursuant to the Imperial Acts Application Act 1969 (NSW), English laws received in 1828 were deemed to be specifically applicable to the colony of New South Wales upon settlement</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Criminal and civil courts were established in 1788 pursuant to the New South Wales Courts Act 1787 (UK) and letters patent from the King dated 2 April 1787</p>
<ul>
<li>It was not until 1810 that the first civilian judge, Ellis Bent, assumed judicial duties in the New South Wales colony</li>

</li>
<li>Three main clauses today foundation of law
<ul>
<li>The first of these clauses defends the freedom of the English Church (which King John sought to encroach upon).
<ul>
<li>Church can elect own officials</li>
<li>No royal interference</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The second enduring clause confirms the liberties and customs of London and other towns.</li>
<li>The main clauses for us
<ul>
<li>No free man shall be seized or imprisoned, or stripped of his rights or possessions, or outlawed or exiled, or deprived of his standing in any other way, nor will we proceed with force against him, or send others to do so, except by the lawful judgment of his equals or by the law of the land.</li>
<li>To no one will we sell, to no one deny or delay right or justice.

<li>
<p>The principles that the Anglo-Australian legal system adopted from England can be summarised in 20 key concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feudalism-
<ul>
<li>The legal obligations to the ruler were formalized with the Norman Conquest in 1066, when William, Duke of Normandy, was crowned King William I and assumed ultimate title to all land in England.
<ul>
<li>This system developed in England and formed the basis of its land law, criminal legal system and taxation system.</li>
<li>It also forms the basis of Australian law in these areas‚Äîthe Crown ultimately owns all the land, our criminal system is based on an action by the state against the wrongdoer, and there is an entrenched power for the government to impose taxes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Law as an autonomous discipline</li>
<li>Common law legal system</li>
<li>Precedent
<ul>
<li>doctrine of precedent requires that the decisions of a court on a matter of law are binding on all courts that are lower in the judicial hierarchy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Equity
<ul>
<li>Checks and balances on courts</li>
<li>The Judicature Acts
<ul>
<li>Acts consolidated the various common law courts (which required the filing of writs based on standard forms that were rigid and would give rise to injustice when parties could not comply) and equity courts (which had more flexibility and usually fairness in their procedure).</li>
<li>The equity and common law courts came together to form one general court, known as the Supreme Court of Judicature (with different divisions),36 to create uniformity in pleading and procedure.
<ul>
<li>Supreme Court Act 1970</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Due process</li>
<li>Juries
<ul>
<li>Today, a jury usually consists of 12 people in a criminal trial and between four and twelve people in a civil trial,</li>
<li>In civil cases, the jury must make a decision as to liability and may also determine the amount of damages awarded</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rule of law
<ul>
<li>government should rule through law, and not through the exercise of arbitrary power by individuals.</li>
<li>Government must be exercised only in accordance with written law, established and enforced by precedented procedure
<ul>
<li>Law applies across the board</li>
<li>Upholds legal rights of citizens</li>
<li>No punishment without illegal conduct</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Importance of procedural law</li>
<li>Parliament
<ul>
<li>shares power with the monarch, comprising elected representatives.</li>
<li>In Australia, the Federal Parliament consists of the Queen, the Senate and the House of Representatives.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Separation of powers
<ul>
<li>3 Arms of government:
<ul>
<li>Legislature (pariliament)</li>
<li>Executive</li>
<li>Judicature</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Parliamentary sovereignty
<ul>
<li>the parliament is supreme over the executive and the judicature except where it provides otherwise.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Independent judiciary
<ul>
<li>judges should be independent of the other arms of government so that their decisions are made freely, according to law.
<ul>
<li>Security of tenure
<ul>
<li>cannot be removed from their position if their decisions are unpopular to the government of the day,</li>
<li>they receive fixed salaries</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Process of legislation making
<ul>
<li>draft laws are introduced into parliament and debated, passed and then assented to by the monarch or their representative.
<ul>
<li>Queen‚Äôs representative in the Commonwealth jurisdiction is the Governor-General,
<ul>
<li>States = Governor,</li>

<li>incorporated into the Commonwealth Constitution in 1901.</li>
<li>All the previous 20 ideals in</li>
<li>First steps
<ul>
<li>establishment of a Legislative Council and Supreme Court in New South Wales and Van Diemen‚Äôs Land (Tasmania).</li>
<li>Enabled by New South Wales Act 1823 (UK).
- King appoint between five and seven members to the Legislative Council.
- Legislative council was to advise the governor (mini-king)
<ul>
<li>Only gov could authorize legislation</li>
<li>Council could defeat a law unless necessary</li>
<li>Australia could not have laws repugnant to UK
- 1825 Executive Council</li>
<li>Same deal as legislative council</li>
<li>Advisory board, Gov could null them if neccessary</li>
<li>Governor appointed same people as legis council
<ul>
<li>Created cabinet government
- Feudal tenure</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All land was Crown grant</li>
<li>Because the land in australia was now Australian (british owned) owned, and because Australian settlers were part of the crown, Australian land became crown land, and crown land can‚Äôt be given out without crown permission
<ul>
<li>The Australian colony is the Crown‚Äôs property.</li>
<li>No one could claim any right or interest in the land unless the Crown granted them permission.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Crown sovereignty gave New South Wales Governor Arthur Phillip right to dispose of lands</li>
<li>Common law precedent affirmed feudal tenure in Attorney-General v Brown (1847) 1 Legge 312
<ul>
<li>titles in the colony were without an overlord, and so the land was considered ‚Äòallodial‚Äô land-
<ul>
<li>A-lord-ial (no lord) land</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sovereign is legal ‚Äòuniversal occupant‚Äô</li>
<li>In 1913, Justice Isaacs held in the High Court of Australia case of Williams v Attorney-General (New South Wales) (1913) 16 CLR 404 (at 439)
<ul>
<li>all colonial land belonged ‚Äòto the Crown until the Crown chose to grant it‚Äô.</li>

<ul>
<li>In R v Murrell, Justice Burton proclaimed that First Nations people, like all other Australians, were British subjects and formally equal before the law.</li>
<li>‚Äòsummary justice‚Äô:</li>
<li>the swift infliction of physical punishment by occupiers who are a law unto themselves.</li>

<li>Common law sustains a distinction between territorial sovereignty and the acquisition of land
<ul>
<li>this distinction is not part of Indigenous laws and social organization</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>English law gave the Crown the prerogative to acquire new territories and did not require the acquisition to be made in compliance with international law.
<ul>
<li>In settled colonies, which  were classified as those areas which  were uninhabited  or  virtually uninhabited
<ul>
<li>English law accompanied colonization to the extent  that it was suitable to the local  circumstances  (McNeil1989, pp.  109-133)</li>

<li>of law, or deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of its laws.</li>

<li>
<p>Bugmy v R (2013)</p>
<ul>
<li>Cause of Appeal
<ul>
<li>Director of Public Prosecutions appealed the case on the grounds that the sentence was inadequate</li>
<li>Two key legal issues - Ratio
<ul>
<li>An appellate court cannot adjust a sentence unless it first makes an explicit finding that the original sentence was manifestly inadequate.</li>
<li>Sentencing factors should relate to the individual offender, be it Aboriginal or non-Aboriginal ‚Äî
<ul>
<li>generic and systemic factors such as incarceration statistics are not relied upon.</li>
<li>In sentencing, full weight should be given to an offender‚Äôs deprived background, regardless of the intervening years and offences.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Laws violated
<ul>
<li>Section 60A(1) makes it an offence to assault a correctional officer while the officer is acting in the execution of his or her duty.</li>
<li>Section 33(1)(b) makes it an offence to cause grievous bodily harm to a person with intent to cause harm of that kind.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Facts
<ul>
<li>Criminal background - in and out of prison since 13 to 29</li>
<li>Mental impairment
<ul>
<li>Caused court to reconsider his sentence due to personal circumstances</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Took Fernando considerations into account
<ul>
<li>raised in an Aboriginal community with alcohol abuse and violence</li>
<li>Fernando was intoxicated at the time</li>
<li>If raised in a community like this, the offender‚Äôs moral culpability is likely less than those whose formative years were better</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Courts are waiting for legislative to fix natives incarcerated</li>
<li>Wood J proposed that being unfamilkiar with European ways would make a lengthy term particularly burdensome</li>
<li>the appellant‚Äôs submission that courts should take judicial notice of the systemic background of deprivation of Aboriginal offenders cannot be accepted</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Director‚Äôs issues
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòGround 1: failed to determine the degree of the offence.</li>
<li>Ground 2: failed to acknowledge the victim as a serving prison officer performing his duties.</li>
<li>Ground 3: Judge weighed the facts of the case too leniently.‚Äô
<ul>
<li>The appellant argued that the three additional grounds were just details of the main issue of manifest inadequacy.</li>
<li>The Director didn‚Äôt argue otherwise but said that the errors found were like manifest inadequacy.</li>
<li>The problem is that the Court of Criminal Appeal either found manifest inadequacy or not.
<ul>
<li>The Court‚Äôs holding said that they didn‚Äôt need to address the issue of manifest inadequacy because the errors identified required a resentencing.</li>
<li>This contradicts the argument that there was an implicit finding of manifest inadequacy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Results
<ul>
<li>Court of Criminal Appeal disagreed with the sentence imposed by Judge Lerve and favoured a more severe sentence.</li>
<li>Appeals said that Judge Lerve gave too much weight to fernando in this case</li>
<li>Must not treat aboriginal offenders different, if so, individual justice is meaningless</li>
<li>Brennan J in Neal v The Queen [(1982) 149 CLR 305],
<ul>
<li>the weight to be afforded to the effects of social deprivation in an offender‚Äôs youth and background is in each case for individual assessment.</li>

<ul>
<li>Clark v Malpas (1862) 31 Beav 80; 54 ER 1067</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Clarify the procedural history of the case.
<ul>
<li>No procedural history</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ascertain the material facts
<ul>
<li>In Clark v Malpas,the material facts relate to
<ul>
<li>the vendor‚Äôs personal circumstances (old,seriously ill, illiterate),</li>
<li>the value ofthe property(about√Ç¬£380), the price actually paid</li>
<li>100 to heir plus 12s (shillings) per week and free rent for life)</li>
<li>and the circumstances in which the transaction occurred
<ul>
<li>(the purchaser knew that the vendor was ill, the vendor had no independent advice, the transaction was completed very quickly and the vendor died soon afterward</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>State the issue raised bythe material facts and how the court answered it (theresult of the case
<ul>
<li>In Clark v Malpas, the facts raised this issue:
<ul>
<li>is it fair for a party to retain the benefit of a bargain where the contract is hastily executed and the other party is a sick old man who received no independent advice and inadequate consideration?
<ul>
<li>And the court‚Äôs answer? No</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Identify the reasoning which supported the decision and the ratio of the case.
<ul>
<li>In this case it‚Äôs facts, so not much ratio (mostly appellate has ratio)</li>
<li>Defendant used precedent that was distinguished by judge due to material difference
<ul>
<li>Previous case gave seller time to move deliberately into transaction</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Example ratio: where the sale of property is for a very inadequate consideration and the circumstances establish that the vendor requires the protection of the law,
<ul>
<li>the burden is on the purchaser to prove that the transaction was entered into carefully, deliberately and with full knowledge</li>

<li>Trial -  Wells J. who found in favour of the bank</li>
<li>Appeal to Supreme Court - Bank</li>
<li>Took it to High Court of Australia</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ascertain the material facts
<ul>
<li>The amadios were under the impression that when they executed and guaranteed the mortgage that their maximum potential liability was $50,000, which was in fact unlimited.</li>
<li>The bank maliciously withheld information from the couple and misrepresented the actual agreement</li>
<li>Did not provide adequate information and confirm understanding in a situation where clearly necessary</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>State the issue raised by the material facts and how the court answered it (the result of the case)
<ul>
<li>Amadio builders were going through a severe liquidity crisis. Bank tricked parents to use entire property to cover any future debt rather than 50,000 as told.</li>
<li>Bank and builder were actually partners, and builders were by father most important customer</li>
<li>National bank that Vinchenzo went to get loan actually suggested that they secure Amadio builders indebtedness (never could repay) and was aware of deception with parents
<ul>
<li>No independent advice, and only learned a few hours ago, no explanation made</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bank argued that Mr Virgo assumed Vincenzo explained everything (not legit)
<ul>
<li>Vincenzo never read the document</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Identify the reasoning which supported the decision and the ratio of the case.
<ul>
<li>The whole transaction should properly be seen as flowing from the special disability which was evident to the bank and as being unfair, unjust and unreasonable.</li>
<li>They did not fully understand the terms which they were entering the agreement, and the bank made little effort to purposely victimize the couple</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Obiter
<ul>
<li>If Mr. and Mrs. Amadio‚Äôs potential liability had been limited to a maximum of $50,000, and if they had been informed as to the true financial position of Amadio Builders, it would be strongly arguable that the guarantee/mortgage could not properly be said either to have resulted from their special disability or to be other than fair, just and reasonable</li>

<li>One party in the transaction had a special disability that created an imbalance between the two parties, making it difficult for them to deal with each other fairly.</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Is it an appeal from a first instance decision or has there been a
series of appeals?</p>
</li>
<li>

Facts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the circumstances in which the dispute arose?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think about what is relevant to the law.</p>
<ul>
<li>You only need to provide enough factual information to explain how the legal issues arose.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify the parties clearly and be consistent;</p>
<ul>
<li>for example avoid referring to the applicant, plaintiff, aggrieved party or party by name interchangeably.
Legal Issues</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the applicable law, or what has been argued to be the applicable law?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is the dispute about defining specific circumstances when a particular legal principle may be relevant?</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, whether in the circumstances has a duty of care arisen and if there has been a breach of the duty of care;</li>
<li>or whether a particular term in a contract be interpreted in a specific way and if that term has been breached based on that interpretation.

<ul>
<li>when the  defendant  assumed   responsibility for  him,  the  measures  taken fell short  of  the  standard  reasonably  to  be  expected;  and   that, accordingly, since it was  the  deceased‚Äôs lack  of  self-control in  his own  interest   that   caused  the   defendant  to   have  to   assume responsibility for  him,  the  damages   recoverable  by  the  plaintiff would   be  reduced  by  two-thirds</li>
<li>Appeal
<ul>
<li>(l)  the  judge  erred  in  law  in  holding  that</li>
<li>the  defendant  owed   the  deceased  a  duty  of  care;</li>
<li>(2)  in  concluding  that such  a  duty  of  care  existed,the  judge  erroneously had   regard  to  the
Queen‚Äôs   Regulations  and   various  standing  orders  as  determining  the existence, as  opposed  to  the  extent, of  the  postulated duty;<br/>
(3)  the  judge erroneously  relied  upon   Barnett  v.  Chelsea  and   Kensington  Hospital Management   Committee  [1969] I  Q.B.  428  as  authority for  the  proposition that  it  was   ‚Äújust  and   reasonable‚Äù  to  impose   a  duty   of  care  upon   the
Defendant;5+6+4
(4)  if the  judge  was  correct in  imposing  a  duty  of  care  in that  regard,  then  he  erred  in  law  in  rejecting the defendant‚Äôs contention that  the  maxim   volenti non  fit injuria applied to  negative any  breach  of such  duty.</li>

<li>Judge phelan awarded 162k, 25% decrease due to burden on dead soldier (his responsibility)</li>

<li>Pleaded guilty</li>
<li>Was required to take appropriate action to prevent death
<ul>
<li>Notes in guidance of followed would have prevented his death</li>
<li>Tossing and turning, and was checked on 3 times</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The  defendant‚Äôs principal ground  of  appeal  is that the  judge  was  wrong   to  hold  that  it was  under  any  duty  to  take  care  to see  that  the  deceased, a  mature  man   30  years  of  age,  did  not  consume   so much   alcohol  that  he   became   unconscious to  exercise control  in  his  own   interest as  well  as  in  the interest of  others.</li>
<li>To  dilute self-responsibility and  to  blame  one  adult  for another‚Äôs lack  of  self-control is  neither just  nor  reasonable and  in  the development  of  the  law  of  negligence an  increment  too  far</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In  the  present  case  I  would   reverse  the  judge‚Äôs  finding  that  the defendant  was   under  a  duty  to  take  reasonable care  to  prevent  the deceased from  abusing  alcohol to  the  extent he  did.  Until  he  collapsed, I  would   hold  that  the  deceased  was   in  law   alone  responsible  for  his condition.</li>
<li>Thereafter, when  the  defendant assumed  responsibility for  him, it accepts that  the  measures  taken  fell short  of  the  standard  reasonably to be  expected. It  did  not  summon   medical  assistance and  its supervision of him  was  inadequate.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>The tests for determining who is an Aboriginal child
<ul>
<li>in  order  for  a  child  to  be  an ‚ÄúAboriginal child‚Äù,  it was  necessary to  identify  an  ancestor  of  the  child  who  was  ‚Äúa member of the Aboriginal  race  of  Australia, and  identified  as  an  Aboriginal  person,  and  was  accepted  by the  Aboriginal  community  as an  Aboriginal  person.‚Äù</li>

<li>definition  of  ‚ÄúAboriginal child‚Äù in   Fischer  v Thompson  is  too  narrow,  and  that there  should  be a  grant of  leave  to appeal</li>
<li>S 4(2)  was  to  permit  a  Court  to  determine  that  a  child  who would  qualify  under  the descent  definition was  an  Aboriginal child,  even  if  no  ancestor satisfied the three-limb definition in the Aboriginal Land Rights Act.</li>
<li>I  am  satisfied  that Belinda  is  of Aboriginal  descent,  meaning  that  she  is  descended  from  the  people  who  lived  in  this country before British colonisation.</li>

<li>(a) the nature of the legal person</li>
<li>and (b)the role of law</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Outsider jurisprudence</li>
<li>Feminists have a diversity of theoretical views concerning the causes of women subordination, the best strategies for addressing it, and how significant the differences are</li>
<li>Four main doctrines
<ul>
<li>Liberal feminism
<ul>
<li>Women = men in ability to operate in the public world, equal opportunity (no legal barriers to advancement)</li>
<li>Merit based evaluation, not gender = formal equality
<ul>
<li>Not fair because pregnant women can‚Äôt claim that men are being fired due to pregnancy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Only benefit a minority of economically and socially privileged woman - already close to male living style</li>
<li>Why should satisfying, well-paid jobs should be the preserve of workers who are able to work full-time in virtue of having minimal domestic responsibilities?</li>
<li>Substantive equality is equity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cultural feminism
<ul>
<li>Difference feminism
<ul>
<li>Direct discrimination
<ul>
<li>Discrimination in employment, education, housing, and goods and service provision</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Indirect discrimination
<ul>
<li>Ex: Will not hire primary caretakers</li>
<li>While a unisex policy, mostly affects women</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Feminists argue that assimilating women into patriarchal systems forces them to adopt male traits
<ul>
<li>Carol Gilligan‚Äôs work on difference feminism argues that men and women have different ways of reasoning and speaking</li>
<li>Women are more concerned about relationships and context, while men focus on rigid rules and individualistic concepts such as rights and justice</li>
<li>Robin West argues that the law needs to incorporate the ignored values associated with ‚Äúwoman‚Äôs voice‚Äù, which emphasizes connection and relationships</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Women prioritize intimacy as the most important value and see separation as a threat
<ul>
<li>difference feminism</li>
<li>Luce Irigaray argues for a separate law for men and women, with sex-specific rights that recognize women‚Äôs sexed bodies</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Double bind
<ul>
<li>For a group subject to domination, all roads to progress can pack a backlash</li>
<li>Potential solution:
<ul>
<li>Fix the problem for everyone, not just women, i,e,. Parental leave, not pregnancy leave</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Radical feminism
<ul>
<li>Focuses on dominance and power, not difference</li>
<li>MacKinnon is exponent
<ul>
<li>Argues pornography is an issue of men‚Äôs power and women‚Äôs lack of it - a root cause of women‚Äôs oppression</li>
<li>Argues for women it is difficult to distinguish rape and sex under conditions of male dominance
<ul>
<li>No way to distinguish</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Postmodern feminism
<ul>
<li>Distrust of grand, general theories - objective truth.
<ul>
<li>Instead full of small-scale, partial, perspectival accounts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Emphasizes differences among women
<ul>
<li>Black women are differently, not more nor less, oppressed by others.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MacKinnon argues too much emphasis on individuals, rather than group disadvantage</li>

<li>A methodical approach to problem questions requires the following steps:
<ul>
<li>Read the problem very carefully and note what you are asked to do.</li>
<li>Identify the legal issue(s) to which the facts of the problem give rise.</li>
<li>State the relevant law and cite authority for it.</li>
<li>Apply the law to the facts.</li>
<li>Reach a conclusion.</li>

<li>offensive behavior if it can be said that conduct is hurtful, blameworthy or improper, and thus may offend.</li>

<li>It was proved that on 16th March, 1966, the defendant climbed on to a pedestal on which a statue of King George V stood and hung a placard, on which was printed in large letters the words ‚ÄúI will not fight in Vietnam‚Äù, from a part of the statue.</li>
<li>squatted down at the foot of the statue and on top of the pedestal for about twenty minutes, refusing to come down when requested to do so by the police.</li>
<li>If the statue were in fact defiled or abused, then strong feelings of resentment might well have been calculated to arise</li>
<li>There is no criticism by the Crown of that political protest or demonstration as such. I have found as facts that: (a) the climbing on the pedestal of the statue and the hanging of the placard from part of the statue were an unpremeditated part of the political protest; (b) the conduct was not a student‚Äôs prank or joke or stunt, but was originally undertaken in an incidental fashion as a means‚Äîeven if a peculiar means‚Äîof drawing wider public attention to the protest.</li>
<li>Sergeant resentment was of silly conduct, a normal reaction</li>

<p>Result</p>
<ul>
<li>On appeal</li>
<li>The behavior complained of considered in its full setting was not a prearranged defilement, abuse or misuse of the statue but an incidental resort to it during the political protest or demonstration with the emphasis on the protest and not on some mistreatment of the statue and, as such, was not ‚Äúoffensive‚Äù behavior within the meaning of s 17(d).</li>

<li>No provocation in public by that person, personal provocation in home</li>
