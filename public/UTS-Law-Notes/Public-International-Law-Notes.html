<li>Hierarchy of Sources and Jus Cogens</li>
</ul>
<h3 id></h3>
<ul>
<li>Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States
<ul>
<li>Article 1
<ul>
<li>The state as a person of international law should possess the following qualifications:
<ul>
<li>(a) a permanent population;</li>
<li>(b) a defined territory;</li>
<li>(c) government; and</li>
<li>(d) capacity to enter into relations with the other states.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Article 3
<ul>
<li>The political existence of the state is independent of recognition by the other states.</li>
<li>Even before recognition the state has the right to defend its integrity and independence, to provide for its conservation and prosperity, and consequently to organize itself as it sees fit, to legislate upon its interests, administer its services, and to define the jurisdiction and competence of its courts.</li>
<li>The exercise of these rights has no other limitation than the exercise of the rights of other states according to international law.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Article 4
<ul>
<li>States are juridically equal, enjoy the same rights, and have equal capacity in their exercise.</li>
<li>The rights of each one do not depend upon the power which it possesses to assure its exercise, but upon the simple fact of its existence as a person under international law.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Article 6
<ul>
<li>The recognition of a state merely signifies that the state which recognizes it accepts the personality of the other with all the rights and duties determined by international law.</li>
<li>Recognition is unconditional and irrevocable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Article 7
<ul>
<li>The recognition of a state may be express or tacit. The latter results from any act which implies the intention of recognizing the new state.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Montevideo summary
<ul>
<li>Criteria for Statehood - population size
<ul>
<li>Reasonable Stability of Population
<ul>
<li>A territory with a sparse population, mostly consisting of nomadic tribes (Western Sahara Ad Op)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Criteria for Statehood - Territory
<ul>
<li>What is the minimum size of a territory in international law?</li>
<li>Must all of a state‚Äôs territory be populated?</li>
<li>Does a territory need to have defined borders?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Criteria for Statehood - Government
<ul>
<li>What form of government must a state have?
<ul>
<li>‚Äì‚Äòeffective‚Äô see eg Aaland Islands Case</li>
<li>‚ÄìExceptions?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the effect of civil war?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Criteria for Statehood - Capacity to enter into relations with other states
<ul>
<li>Essential requirement connected to concept of independence</li>
<li>Must be legally independent from other states and have no limitations on its capacity to enter into agreements</li>
<li>Does not take economic or political pressures on a state into account</li>
<li>Situations not affecting formal independence:
<ul>
<li>‚Äì Delegation of certain functions (ie military) not seen to affect independence</li>
<li>‚Äì Voluntary Surrender:
<ul>
<li>‚Äì ‚Äòthe right of entering into international engagements is an attribute of sovereignty‚Äô SS Wimbledon Case (PCIL 1923)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Key Questions:
<ul>
<li>Is there a relationship of subordination and superiority? (Austro-German Custom Union Case)</li>
<li>Any external sovereignty? Ie subordination to a different state?
<ul>
<li>‚Äì Norfolk Island</li>
<li>‚Äì Hong Kong</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This is a separate consideration to a state‚Äôs subordination to PIL</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Criteria for Statehood?
<ul>
<li>Membership in International Orgs ‚Äì Art 4 UN Charter requires ‚Äòpeace loving state‚Äô that accepts and carries out obligations under the charter.</li>
<li>States that act ‚Äòlawfully‚Äô</li>
<li>Apartheid South Africa:
<ul>
<li>Were Bantustans a State under PIL?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Southern Rhodesia: [see H&amp;S p 106-7]</li>
<li>Self-determination</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Five principles of jurisdiction recognized by International Law (Harvard)
<ul>
<li>Objective Territorial Principle
<ul>
<li>asserts that a state has the jurisdiction to prosecute crimes that are initiated outside its territory but have significant effects or consequences within its territory.</li>
<li>AKA Territorial Principle: States have jurisdiction over acts committed within their territory.</li>
<li>D.P.P. v Doot,</li>
<li>R. v Bates,</li>
<li>Lotus case</li>
<li>Island of palmas</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Principle of Universality:
<ul>
<li>asserts that a state has jurisdiction to prosecute certain offenses, regardless of where they were committed, and regardless of the nationality of the perpetrator or the victim, because the crimes are so serious that they affect the international community as a whole.</li>
<li>Jus cogens</li>
<li>Israel case</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nationality Principle:
<ul>
<li>States have jurisdiction over their nationals, even when those nationals are abroad.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Protective Principle:
<ul>
<li>States have jurisdiction over acts outside their territory that threaten the state‚Äôs security, such as espionage or counterfeiting currency.</li>
<li>doctrine of the contiguous zone
<ul>
<li>Would the principle allow State A to exercise criminal jurisdiction over the officials of State B in respect of their actions in the execution of an unfriendly policy (e.g. a trade embargo) of State B towards State A?</li>
<li>The doctrine provides coastal states with limited enforcement powers beyond their territorial sea, specifically related to customs, immigration, fiscal, and sanitary matters. While it does not confer full sovereignty, it allows states to protect their interests just beyond their territorial boundaries, balancing their rights with the freedoms of other states on the high seas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Joyce v DPP [1946] AC 347</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Passive Personality Principle:
<ul>
<li>States may claim jurisdiction over acts committed abroad that harm their nationals.</li>
<li>US v Yunis (No.2)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Five heads of jurisdiction recognized by international law
<ul>
<li>Territorial Jurisdiction: Authority over acts committed within a state‚Äôs own territory.</li>
<li>Nationality (or Active Personality) Jurisdiction: Authority over a state‚Äôs nationals, regardless of where they are located.</li>
<li>Passive Personality Jurisdiction: Authority over acts committed abroad that harm the state‚Äôs nationals.</li>
<li>Protective Jurisdiction: Authority over acts outside a state‚Äôs territory that threaten its security or governmental functions.</li>
<li>Universal Jurisdiction: Authority over certain serious crimes (e.g., genocide, war crimes) that are recognized as affecting the international community as a whole, regardless of where they occur.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969 (VCLT)
<ul>
<li>VCLT is considered the ‚ÄòTreaty on Treaties‚Äô and as such, provides the principles of law relating to the drafting, application and interpretation of other treaties.</li>
<li>It is largely recognised as the pre-eminent statement on the law of treaties, even by those States who are not parties to the Convention.</li>
<li>Codification of Customary International Law</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>basic elements of a treaty?</li>
<li>Elements of treaty making
<ul>
<li>Proposal for a treaty</li>
<li>Capacity to conclude treaties</li>
<li>Adoption of the text</li>
<li>Authentication of the text</li>
<li>Consent to be bound</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>Head of State and Government Officials:
<ul>
<li>Absolute Immunity: Heads of state, heads of government, and foreign ministers typically enjoy absolute immunity from the jurisdiction of foreign courts while they are in office. This immunity covers all acts, both official and private, and is not subject to exceptions, even for alleged violations of international law.</li>
<li>International Customary Law: This immunity is recognized under customary international law and is grounded in the need to protect the sovereignty and effective governance of states.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Acts Performed in an Official Capacity:
<ul>
<li>Functional Immunity (Immunity Ratione Materiae): After leaving office, former officials (including foreign ministers) retain immunity for acts performed in their official capacity. This type of immunity, known as ‚Äúfunctional immunity,‚Äù protects them from legal actions related to their official acts while in office, as these acts are considered acts of the state itself.</li>
<li>Personal Immunity (Immunity Ratione Personae): While in office, these officials also enjoy ‚Äúpersonal immunity,‚Äù which is broader and covers all acts, official or personal. This immunity ceases when they leave office, except for the continued protection of official acts under functional immunity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>State Immunity
<ul>
<li>Concept of Immunity is underpinned by the principles of State Sovereignty, reciprocity and State equality (par in parem non habet imperium ‚Äì an equal does not have power over an equal).</li>
<li>Concept of Immunity has developed with time and there has been a move from the traditional Absolute Immunity approach (where the State enjoyed complete immunity from domestic legal action) to a so called Restrictive Immunity approach (where the State only enjoys immunity under certain circumstances).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Week 7: Treaty-Making
<ul>
<li>Treaty Interpretation Methods
<ul>
<li>Treaty Interpretation ‚Äì Three Schools of Thought
<ul>
<li>Textual School ‚Äì ‚ÄòOrdinary approach‚Äô -  It looks into the ‚Äòordinary‚Äô meaning of the text;</li>
<li>Intentionalist School ‚Äì ‚ÄòSubjective approach‚Äô - attempted to ascertain the intention of the drafters;</li>
<li>Teleological School ‚Äì ‚ÄòTeleological approach‚Äô - construe a treaty provision in light of the object and purpose of the treaty.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention incorporates elements of all three schools
<ul>
<li>Article 31 - General rule of interpretation
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Pacta Sunt Servanda - in good faith</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Third Party Treaties
<ul>
<li>Art. 34-36 - treaties do not create obligations or rights for third states without their consent.</li>
<li>Free zones of Upper Savoy and the District of Gex case (1932) (France v Switzerland) PCIJ reports, Series A/B, No. 46</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Material Breach
<ul>
<li>VCLT - material breach 60(1) repudiation of the treaty of the violation of a provision that is essential to the object and purpose of the treaty.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Termination, suspension and withdrawal from treaties
<ul>
<li>By treaty, consent or incompatible later treaty</li>
<li>Material breach
<ul>
<li>Art 60</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>International Law</li>
<li>Public international law = PIL def</li>
<li>THE SCOPE AND NATURE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW
<ul>
<li>The central core of international law def may be described as the body of rules and principles that determine the rights and duties of States, primarily in respect of their dealings with other States and the citizens of other States</li>
<li>Archetypal international law def
<ul>
<li>concerned with the rights and duties of States towards one another</li>
<li>but the principles, materials and techniques of international law are applied much more widely.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>International law is not a unified, manufactured system, imposed upon the world of international or inter-communal relations</li>
<li>The rules of international law cover whatever topics happen to have been regarded as appropriate for legal solution on the international plane</li>
<li>It is often asserted that international law in its modern form dates from the Treaty of Westphalia def in 1648, which is said to have ‚Äòcreated‚Äô the system of modern nation-State
<ul>
<li>The forms‚Äîtreaties, embassies, claims to jurisdiction or immunity, to territory and nationality, and so on‚Äîgo back far beyond the Treaty of Westphalia; and it is in the forms and formulas of governmental intercourse that the lifeblood of international law has always flowed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1.3 THE CHANGING SCOPE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW
<ul>
<li>Modern international human rights law def
<ul>
<li>The making in 1948 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, along with the adoption of regional instruments such as the
<ul>
<li>American Declaration of the Rights of Man in 1948</li>
<li>European Convention on Human Rights in 1950</li>
<li>followed by
<ul>
<li>1981 African Charter on Human and People‚Äôs Rights,</li>
<li>1994 Arab Charter on Human Rights</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1.4 THE EMERGENCE OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
<ul>
<li>establishment in 1871 of the arbitration tribunal that settled the United States‚Äô claims against Britain for compensation for the damage inflicted upon the Union by the confederate warship Alabama during the American Civil War</li>
<li>It led to the establishment of the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) under the League of Nations, and its successor, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), under the United Nations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1.5 THE EMERGENCE OF NEW INTERNATIONAL ACTORS
<ul>
<li>Companies have an easier time negotiating with foreign powers and the resources to do so, rather than letting their state negotiate for them with complicated interests to further
<ul>
<li>Supported by 1965 Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States (the ICSID Convention), the NAFTA, and the Energy Charter Treaty.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Human rights changes
<ul>
<li>This right of individual petition def
<ul>
<li>introduced in the 1950 European Convention on Human Right</li>
<li>Added in addition to the right of states to file against other states</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) have secured an acknowledged place within the international legal system.
<ul>
<li>Conventions, such as the 1978 American Convention on Human Rights, permit applications to be made by representative organizations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1.6 WHY DO PEOPLE COMPLY WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW?
<ul>
<li>Treaties def are, therefore, commitments that States have already decided that it is in their interest to comply with.</li>
<li>Rules of customary international law def
<ul>
<li>Rules that are consistently followed such as the historic immunity to envoys/medics/messengers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Countries will typically follow the laws and treaties they‚Äôve signed because they were not forced to sign them to begin with, and as such see the benefit</li>
<li>Arguments you use may be used against you</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1.7 WHY SHOULD PEOPLE COMPLY WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW?
<ul>
<li>Rule of law, mandate of heaven, swear by religion when making treaties, etc</li>
<li>Eventually shifted towards secular reasoning based on ‚Äòconsent of the governed‚Äô
<ul>
<li>Positivist def
<ul>
<li>the authority of international law derived from the fact that States had‚Äîor were to be treated as if they had‚Äîconsented to be bound by its rules, and not from any external source such as the ‚Äòwill of God‚Äô or ‚Äòthe natural order‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jus cogens def:
<ul>
<li>Rules that are binding on all States regardless of whether or not the States have consented to be bound by them</li>
<li>A.K.A. Peremptory norms def</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>1.8 HOW INTERNATIONAL LAW IS INVOKED AND APPLIED
<ul>
<li>illocution: that is, approximately, the implicit meaning that the speaker intends to communicate when saying something.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1.9 THE DOMESTIC ANALOGY
<ul>
<li>Requesting borrowed book back from student on university stationary, makes it official and formal</li>
<li>Many choices that can change the context, including hinting at police or court involvement</li>
<li>By using a university tribunal, lends credence to the existence of the tribunal itself, and makes their existence more of a factor in the calculations of members of the community.</li>
<li>The law succeeds if it secures enough compliance to enable civilized social life to proceed and if its enforcement is sufficiently effective, impartial, and non-discriminatory to satisfy the basic demands of justice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Aboriginal Peoples, Colonialism and International Law: Raw Law
<ul>
<li>Indigenous Ways
<ul>
<li>Global colonialism has damaged our relationships with the natural world; many First Nations Peoples have no land base and live within cities, suburbs and country towns
<ul>
<li>But still hold the law, the stories and the songs for country</li>

<li>International processes and mechanisms
<ul>
<li>UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples was adopted in September 2007.

<li>The Sources of International Law
<ul>
<li>Generally
<ul>
<li>Article 38(1) Distinction:
<ul>
<li>Sub-paragraphs (a)-(c): Address the pedigree of international law rules.</li>
<li>Sub-paragraph (d): Enumerates means for determining alleged rules of international law.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Law-Creating Processes:
<ul>
<li>For the World Court to apply a rule, it must stem from treaties, international customary law, or general principles recognized by civilized nations.</li>
<li>This enumeration excludes other potential sources like natural law or moral postulates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Court‚Äôs Obligation:
<ul>
<li>The Court must consider any rule from these three law-creating processes.</li>
<li>The rule‚Äôs origin (humanity considerations, civilization standards) is irrelevant if it aligns with these processes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ex aequo et bono def Decisions:
<ul>
<li>The Court can decide cases ex aequo et bono (equity) only with parties‚Äô agreement, which must itself be treaty-based.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Formal vs. Material Sources:
<ul>
<li>Formal sources give legal validity (e.g., customs).</li>
<li>Material sources provide substance (e.g., state practice), serving as evidence of these customs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Order of Application:
<ul>
<li>There was a debate about indicating an order of precedence for applying these sources (treaties before customs, etc.).</li>
<li>Ultimately, it was decided to avoid prescribing a strict order to allow for simultaneous application and respect the unique nature of each source.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>What is a treaty?
<ul>
<li>
<p>A Treaty is defined as:</p>
<ul>
<li>An international agreement concluded between States in written form and governed by international law, whether embodied in a single instrument or in two or more related instruments and whatever its particular designation. (See Art. 2 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969 ‚Äì VCLT)</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Treaties and their relationship with customary international law
<ul>
<li>Provisions of Treaties can become customary international law, and customary international law can become part of treaties</li>
<li>In three different ways (see ILC conclusion 11):
<ul>
<li>Treaty declares pre-existing customary international law (as Nicaragua argued in Military and Paramilitary Activities)</li>
<li>Treaty represents crystallization of an emerging rule of custom customary international law (as Netherlands and Denmark argued in North Sea Shelf)</li>
<li>Subsequent practice makes treaty rule into custom</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States) (Merits) ICJ Reports 1986, p.14
<ul>
<li>‚Äúcustomary international law continues to exist alongside treaty law even if the customary norm and the treaty norm were to have exactly the same content, this would not be a reason for the Court to hold that the incorporation of the customary norm into treaty-law must deprive the customary norm of its applicability as distinct from that of the treaty norm‚Ä¶. there are no grounds for holding that when customary international law is comprised of rules identical to those of treaty law, the latter ‚Äúsupervenes‚Äù the former, so that the customary international law has no further existence of its own.‚Äù (paras 176- 177).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Customary International Law
<ul>
<li>A useful explanation has been provided by (Greig 1976)
<ul>
<li>‚Äúinternational custom results from similar and repeated acts by states-repeated with the conscious conviction of the parties that they are acting in conformity with the law. Thus there are two factors in the formation of custom:
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>a material fact-the repetition of similar acts by states, and</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>a psychological element usually called the opinion juris sive necessitates the feeling on the part of the States that in acting as they act, they are fulfilling a legal obligation‚Äù (Greig 1976)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Two elements. Both must be established:
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>State practice- behaviour &amp; practice of states (objective facts)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Duration, consistency, repetition and generality?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>Psychological or subjective belief (opinio juris)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>States feel bound or obliged to act in a certain way</li>
<li>Maxim: opinio juris sive necessitatis</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In summary, Customary International Law = state practice + opinio juris</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>North Sea Continental Shelf cases (FR Germany v Denmark, FR Germany v The Netherlands) ICJ Reports 1969, p.3
<ul>
<li>Dispute in boundary delimitation negotiations between Germany, The Netherlands and Denmark.</li>
<li>Did the equidistance/special circumstances rule in Art 6 of the 1958 Geneva Convention on the Continental shelf apply? Germany had not yet ratified the treaty. Could only apply if the rule was also Customary International Law.</li>
<li>Held: ‚Äú‚Ä¶two conditions must be fulfilled. Not only must the acts concerned amount to a settled practice, but they must also be such, or be carried out in such a way, as to be evidence of a belief that this practice is rendered obligatory by the existence of a rule of Iaw requiring it. The need for such a belief, i.e., the existence of a subjective element, is implicit in the very notion of the opinio juris sive necessitatis. The States concerned must therefore feel that they are conforming to what amounts to a legal obligation. The frequency, or even habitual character of the acts is not in itself enough. There are many international acts, e.g., in the field of ceremonial and protocol, which are performed almost invariably, but which are motivated only by considerations of courtesy, convenience or tradition, and not by any sense of legal duty‚Äù. (para 77)</li>
<li>‚ÄúAs regards the time element, the Court notes that it is over ten years since the Convention was signed, but that it is even now less than five since it came into force in June 1964, and that when the present proceedings were brought it was less than three years, while less than one had elapsed at the time when the respective negotiations between the Federal Republic and the other two Parties for a complete delimitation broke down on the question of the application of the equidistance principle. Although the passage of only a short period of time is not necessarily, or of itself, a bar to the formation of a new rule of customary international law on the basis of what was originally a purely conventional rule, an indispensable requirement would be that within the period in question, short though it might be, State practice, including that of States whose interests are specially affected, should have been both extensive and virtually uniform in the sense of the provision invoked;-and should moreover have occurred in such a way as to show a general recognition that a rule of law or legal obligation is involved.‚Äù</li>
<li>equidistance principle def, or principle of equidistance def,

<li>a legal concept in maritime boundary claims that a nation‚Äôs maritime boundaries should conform to a median line that is equidistant from the shores of neighboring nations.</li>

</li>
<li>Lotus case (France v Turkey) (1927) PCIJ, Ser.A, no.10
<ul>
<li>A French vessel The Lotus collided on the high seas with a Turkish vessel the Boz-Kourt. 8 passengers and crew were killed. When the ship docked in Turkey, Turkish authorities arrested the French officer of the watch. Key issue was whether Turkey had jurisdiction to prosecute him for manslaughter?</li>
<li>France argued that because there had been so few examples of criminal prosecutions of other states ‚Äòflagged vessels‚Äô this demonstrated the existence of a principle of customary international law that only the ‚Äòflag state‚Äô had exclusive jurisdiction.</li>
<li>Court held that needed to show a subjective element stating</li>
<li>[absence of other states exercising jurisdiction would] ‚Äúmerely show that States had often, in practice, abstained from instituting criminal proceedings, and not that they recognised themselves as being obliged to do so; for only is such abstention were based on their being conscious of having a duty to abstain would it be possible to speak of an international custom‚Ä¶‚Äù</li>

<li>Requirement of practice
<ul>
<li>I. The requirement of a general practice, as a constituent element of customary international law, refers primarily to the practice of States at contributes to the formation, or expression, of rules of customary international law.</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>In certain cases, the practice of international organizations also contributes to the formation, or expression, of rules of customary Internationa aw.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="3">
<li>Conduct of other actors is not practice that contributes to the formation, or expression, of rules of customary international law, but may be relevant when assessing the practice referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2.</li>

</li>
<li>Conclusion 5</li>
<li>Conduct of the State as State Practice
<ul>
<li>State practice consists of conduct of the State, whether in the exercise of its executive, legislative, judicial or other functions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Conclusion 6</li>
<li>Forms of practice

<li>
<ol>
<li>Practice may take a wide range of forms.</li>

<li>Conclusion 7</li>
<li>Assessing a State‚Äôs practice
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Account is to be taken of all available practice of a particular State, which is to be assessed as a whole.</li>
</ol>

<li>Recognition in International Law
<ul>
<li>Considered important act that can affect a state‚Äôs ability to exercise its rights and responsibilities as a state</li>
<li>nb there is a difference between recognition of states and recognition of governments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Two Theories of Recognition (of States)
<ul>
<li>The Constitutive Theory
<ul>
<li>Recognition has a ‚Äòconstitutive‚Äô effect so that a state becomes an international legal person and a subject of IL only through recognition.‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Declaratory Theory
<ul>
<li>States exist independent of recognition:
<ul>
<li>‚Äòthe primary function of recognition is to acknowledge as a fact something which has hitherto been uncertain, namely the independence of the body claiming to be a state, and to declare the declaring state‚Äôs readiness to accept the normal consequences of that fact ‚Äì namely the usual courtesies, rights and obligations of international relations between states.‚Äô (Brierly, in H&amp;S p 137).</li>
<li>The weight of authorities favours the declaratory theory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Does State Practice reflect declaratory or constitutive theory?
<ul>
<li>Declaratory
<ul>
<li>States make claims under IL against unrecognised states:
<ul>
<li>Britain: Israel 1949 (see H&amp;S p 138); Taiwan 1957.</li>
<li>US: North Korea</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Constitutive
<ul>
<li>US: Israel (see discussion in H&amp;S p 137)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What do the sources say (Declaratory or Constitutive)?
<ul>
<li>Declaratory:
<ul>
<li>Montevideo Convention Arts 3, 6, 7.</li>
<li>Tinoco arbitration</li>
<li>Badinter Commission Opinion No 1.
<ul>
<li>‚Äì recognition is ‚Äòpurely declaratory‚Äô</li>
<li>‚Äì Recognition is a ‚Äòdiscretionary act‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Writings of the most Qualified Publicists
<ul>
<li>See H&amp;S p 138</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Modes of Recognition
<ul>
<li>Explicit or implicit (Montevideo art 7).</li>
<li>Diplomatic Relations</li>
<li>Making a bilateral treaty with the entity</li>
<li>Supporting membership at the UN</li>
<li>Arranging an international conference</li>
<li>However: role of intention.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Political Nature of Recognition
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòStates have discovered that the granting or withholding of recognition can be used to further a national policy.</li>
<li>States have refused it as a mark of disapproval, as nearly all of them did to Manchukuo and they have granted it in order to establish the very independence of which recognition is supposed to be a mere acknowledgement.</li>
<li>So, ‚Ä¶ we can point to the situation in 1948 when the US recognised Israel within a few hours of its proclamation of independence.‚Äô Brierly ‚Äì Law of Nations (H&amp;S p 137)
<ul>
<li>‚Äì (for context on US recognition of Israel see H&amp;S p 137 fn 180.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Shaw ‚Äì recognition is a purely political act</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The legal side of Recognition?
<ul>
<li>Badinter Commission Opinion No 10.
<ul>
<li>recognition is a discretionary act that other states may perform when and in the manner they choose, ‚Äòsubject only to compliance with the imperatives of general international law, and particularly those prohibiting the use of force in dealings with other states or guaranteeing the rights of ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities.‚Äô</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Southern Rhodesia eg (unlawfulness of minority rule).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Does the practice of state recognition add additional criteria to statehood?
<ul>
<li>See European Community (EC)‚Äòs Guidelines on the Recognition of New States in Eastern Europe and in the Soviet Union (Dec 1991),
<ul>
<li>Respect for the provisions of UN Charter</li>
<li>Guarantees of ethnic and national groups‚Äô and minorities‚Äô rights</li>
<li>Respect for inviolability of frontiers (only changed by peaceful means and common agreement)</li>
<li>Acceptance of all relevant commitments re disarmament, nuclear non-proliferation, security, regional stability</li>
<li>Commitment to settle by agreement (if necessary, arbitration) all questions concerning state succession and regional disputes</li>
<li>Are these additional criteria of statehood? ‚Äì See H&amp;S p 140.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Note regional scope (Europe).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Recognition of Governments
<ul>
<li>Recognition of governments is distinct from recognition of states</li>
<li>When does recognition of Gov‚Äôt become relevant?
<ul>
<li>‚Äì Normally after ‚Äònonconventional‚Äô change [revolution; coup eg]</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tinoco Arbitration
<ul>
<li>non-recognition by governments ‚Äòcannot outweigh the evidence [of] ‚Ä¶ the character of Tinoco‚Äôs gov‚Äôt according to the standard set by international law</li>

<li>Austro-German Customs Union Case (Advisory Opinion) [1931] PCIJ Series A/B No 41
<ul>
<li>Court: Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ)</li>
<li>Parties: Advisory Opinion requested by the Council of the League of Nations</li>
<li>Procedural History:
<ul>
<li>In 1931, Austria and Germany reached a preliminary agreement to establish a customs union, which would create free trade between the two states. This proposed union raised significant concerns among other European states, leading to what was described as a ‚ÄúEuropean crisis.‚Äù</li>
<li>The Council of the League of Nations requested an advisory opinion from the PCIJ to determine whether the proposed customs union would violate international obligations under the Treaty of Saint-Germain and the Protocol of 1922.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Facts:
<ul>
<li>The Treaty of Saint-Germain (1919) included Article 88, which asserted that Austria‚Äôs independence was inalienable without the consent of the League of Nations.
<ul>
<li>Austria also undertook not to compromise its independence in any way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The 1922 Protocol reinforced Austria‚Äôs economic independence, imposing further restrictions on any actions that might undermine its sovereign status.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Legal Issue:
<ul>
<li>Whether Austria‚Äôs agreement with Germany to form a customs union would violate Article 88 of the Treaty of Saint-Germain and the 1922 Protocol, thereby compromising Austria‚Äôs independence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Decision:
<ul>
<li>The PCIJ, by a narrow margin of eight votes to seven, advised that the proposed customs union would be incompatible with the Protocol of 1922.</li>
<li>Additionally, a majority of the judges opined (though not as a formal ruling of the Court) that the customs union would also contravene Article 88 of the Treaty of Saint-Germain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ratio Decidendi:
<ul>
<li>The Court emphasized that Austria‚Äôs independence, as protected by Article 88, meant that Austria had to remain a separate state with full control over its own economic, political, and financial affairs.</li>
<li>The establishment of the customs union was seen as a potential step toward political union, which would undermine Austria‚Äôs sovereignty by subjecting its decisions to German influence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Significance:
<ul>
<li>The Austro-German Customs Union Case is significant for its interpretation of state sovereignty and independence in international law.</li>
<li>The decision underscored the importance of maintaining a state‚Äôs independence from external control, especially in situations where economic agreements could lead to political subordination.</li>
<li>This case is frequently cited in discussions of state sovereignty and the limitations imposed by international treaties on a state‚Äôs ability to enter into agreements that may compromise its independence.</li>

<li>FRENCH INDEMNITY OF 1831</li>
<li>FRENCH INDEMNITY OF 1831 US Claims Commission. Moore, 5
<ul>
<li>Procedural History:
<ul>
<li>After the Napoleonic Wars, France agreed to pay compensation to the United States for damages suffered by American nationals.</li>
<li>The US Claims Commission was established to distribute these funds and determine France‚Äôs liability, particularly regarding losses caused by other nations under French influence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Facts:
<ul>
<li>During the Napoleonic Wars, Holland was a nominally independent state but came under substantial French control, particularly after 1806 when Napoleon‚Äôs brother, Louis Bonaparte, was installed as the king of Holland.</li>
<li>By 1810, Holland was formally annexed into the French Empire.</li>
<li>American merchants suffered losses due to the sequestration of their goods in Dutch ports, which was ordered by France under the Franco-Dutch treaty.</li>
<li>Denmark, while maintaining formal independence, engaged in actions that harmed U.S. nationals, likely motivated by the desire to align with French interests or gain favor with Napoleon.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Legal Issue:
<ul>
<li>The central question was whether France could be held liable for the actions of Holland and Denmark, given the extent of France‚Äôs control or influence over these nations during the Napoleonic Wars.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Decision:
<ul>
<li>The US Claims Commission ruled that France was liable for the damages caused by Holland, as Holland was effectively under French control and lacked true sovereignty.</li>
<li>However, France was not held liable for the damages caused by Denmark, as Denmark was considered an independent state acting on its own accord.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ratio Decidendi:
<ul>
<li>The decision was based on the principle that a state can be held responsible for the actions of another state if the latter is under its significant control or influence, to the point where it lacks genuine sovereignty.</li>
<li>In this case, Holland was deemed to be a dependent state under French control, making France liable for its actions.</li>
<li>Denmark, however, retained enough independence to absolve France of responsibility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Significance:
<ul>
<li>This case is significant in international law for its contribution to the understanding of state sovereignty and responsibility.</li>
<li>It highlights the conditions under which a state may be held liable for the actions of another state, particularly when issues of de facto control and influence are involved.</li>
<li>The case informs contemporary discussions on state responsibility, especially in contexts where one state exercises significant influence over another‚Äôs actions, and remains relevant in the context of modern international relations.</li>

</ul>

<li>Western Sahara Case (Advisory Opinion) [1975] ICJ Reports 12
<ul>
<li>Court: International Court of Justice (ICJ)</li>
<li>Parties:
<ul>
<li>Requesting Party: United Nations General Assembly (seeking an advisory opinion).</li>
<li>States Involved: Morocco and Mauritania.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Procedural History:
<ul>
<li>In 1966, the United Nations General Assembly called for the decolonization of Western Sahara, emphasizing the right to self-determination as per General Assembly Resolution 1514 (XV).</li>
<li>Spain, the colonial power, agreed to hold a referendum under UN supervision in 1975.</li>
<li>However, Morocco and Mauritania, both neighboring states, claimed historical ties to the territory and sought to assert their claims.</li>
<li>The General Assembly then requested an advisory opinion from the ICJ on two key questions regarding the status and legal ties of Western Sahara.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Facts:
<ul>
<li>Western Sahara, also known as the Spanish Sahara, was colonized by Spain in 1884.</li>
<li>The territory, rich in phosphates and abundant in fishing resources, was sparsely populated, with a 1974 census recording a population of 74,900, mostly nomadic Saharan tribesmen.</li>
<li>Spain‚Äôs colonization efforts met with opposition as the territory‚Äôs strategic and economic value became apparent, especially to Morocco, a competitor in the phosphates industry.</li>
<li>By the mid-20th century, the pressure for decolonization intensified, leading Spain to agree to a UN-supervised referendum.</li>
<li>However, Morocco claimed the territory based on historic ties preceding Spanish colonization, with Mauritania making a similar overlapping claim.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Legal Issue:
<ul>
<li>The ICJ was asked to address two primary questions:
<ul>
<li>Whether Western Sahara (comprising the regions of Rio de Oro and Sakiet El Hamra) was, at the time of its colonization by Spain, a territory belonging to no one (terra nullius).</li>
<li>If the territory was not terra nullius, what were the legal ties between Western Sahara and the Kingdom of Morocco and the Mauritanian entity?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Decision:
<ul>
<li>The ICJ concluded that Western Sahara was not terra nullius at the time of Spanish colonization.</li>
<li>The Court recognized that, although the territory was sparsely populated and had no formal state structures, the indigenous peoples had social and political organizations, and legal ties existed with Morocco and the Mauritanian entity.</li>
<li>However, these ties did not amount to sovereignty, nor did they indicate that Morocco or Mauritania had ownership or control over Western Sahara at the time of colonization.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ratio Decidendi:
<ul>
<li>The ICJ‚Äôs decision was based on the principle that territory cannot be considered terra nullius if it was inhabited by people with established social and political organization.</li>
<li>The presence of such structures, along with the acknowledgment of some degree of allegiance or authority (though not sovereignty) between Western Sahara‚Äôs inhabitants and Morocco/Mauritania, meant that the territory was not ownerless before Spanish colonization.</li>
<li>However, the legal ties did not confer sovereignty or diminish the applicability of the right to self-determination.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Significance:
<ul>
<li>The ICJ‚Äôs advisory opinion reinforced the principle of self-determination in international law, affirming that the historical ties claimed by Morocco and Mauritania did not negate the right of the people of Western Sahara to decide their own future.</li>
<li>The ruling highlighted the limitations of historical claims in the face of contemporary international legal principles concerning decolonization and self-determination.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Key Takeaways:
<ul>
<li>The Court clarified that terra nullius cannot be claimed for territories with existing social and political organizations, even if those structures are informal or loosely connected.</li>
<li>The decision emphasized the primacy of self-determination over historical claims when it comes to decolonization.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Relevance to Modern Law:
<ul>
<li>The Western Sahara case continues to influence international legal discourse on self-determination and the decolonization process.</li>
<li>It underscores the limitations of historical claims when weighed against the right of indigenous populations to determine their political status and future.</li>
<li>The ruling has implications for other territorial disputes where historic ties are invoked to override the right to self-determination.</li>
</ul>
</li>

</li>
<li>Reference re Secession of Quebec

- the international law right to self-determination only generates, at best/ a right to external self-determination in situations of former colonies;

<li>Article 1
<ul>
<li>The state as a person of international law should possess the following qualifications:

<li>(a) a permanent population;</li>
<li>(b) a defined territory;</li>
<li>(c) government; and</li>
<li>(d) capacity to enter into relations with the other states.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Article 3
<ul>
<li>The political existence of the state is independent of recognition by the other states.</li>
<li>Even before recognition, the state has the right to defend its integrity and independence, to provide for its conservation and prosperity, and consequently to organize itself as it sees fit, to legislate upon its interests, administer its services, and to define the jurisdiction and competence of its courts.</li>
<li>The exercise of these rights has no other limitation than the exercise of the rights of other states according to international law.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Article 4
<ul>
<li>States are juridically equal, enjoy the same rights, and have equal capacity in their exercise.</li>
<li>The rights of each one do not depend upon the power which it possesses to assure its exercise but upon the simple fact of its existence as a person under international law.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Article 6
<ul>
<li>The recognition of a state merely signifies that the state that recognizes it accepts the personality of the other with all the rights and duties determined by international law.</li>
<li>Recognition is unconditional and irrevocable.</li>
</ul>

<li>Treaties and Australian Law
<ul>
<li>The Treaty-Making + Domestic Transformation Process (JSCOT)</li>
<li>Basic Principles
<ul>
<li>Treaties do not form part of Australian law unless incorporated through Commonwealth legislation (ie requires an act of the legislature = strong transformation approach)
<ul>
<li>See Dietrich v The Queen (1992) 177 CLR 292</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Different ways to incorporate international treaty obligations?
<ul>
<li>All or part of Treaty‚Äôs content may be included in an Act;</li>
<li>The text of the Treaty may be added as a Schedule to existing legislation; or</li>
<li>Legislation can be enacted which states that a Treaty has force of law. (see extract from article by Bill Campbell KC in reading for more examples)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If only a portion of the Treaty is given legislative effect, the remainder is not enforceable under municipal law</li>

</li>
<li>International law and its influence on the Australian common law ‚Äì customary international law
<ul>
<li>Unsettled relationship-conflicting authorities
<ul>
<li>In other common law countries (e.g. UK, Canada), courts have favoured incorporation approach for Customary International Law</li>
<li>Key foundational Australian cases seem to favour a transformation approach:
<ul>
<li>Polites v Commonwealth (1945) 70 CLR 60</li>
<li>Chow Hung Ching v The King (1948) 77 CLR 449</li>
<li>Nulyarimma v Thompson (1999) 96 FCR 153</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nulyarimma v. Thompson [1999] FCA 1192
<ul>
<li>Key Legal Question: Is genocide a crime under Australian law?
<ul>
<li>Accepted that it was a jus cogens prohibition &amp; crime under customary international law</li>
<li>Yet no implementing legislation (at the time) in Australia</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>FCA held:
<ul>
<li>Majority (Wilcox &amp; Whitlam JJ):
<ul>
<li>Crime of genocide can only be introduced into Australian law by legislation</li>
<li>In absence of such legislation, genocide is not a crime under Australian law</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In addition, Whitlam J
<ul>
<li>Even if the crime of genocide could be recognised by the courts, such recognition may be inconsistent with existing legislation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Merkel J (dissenting):
<ul>
<li>Crime of genocide is part of Australian common law</li>
<li>Same approach to question of incorporation should be used for both customary crimes and norms of customary international law</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>YET:
<ul>
<li>On facts, not genocide</li>
<li>Even if facts made out, relief would not have been granted due to parliamentary privileges and implied freedom of political communication</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nulyarimma majority reasoning was followed in other ‚Äògenocide‚Äô cases:
<ul>
<li>Thorpe v Kennett [1999] VSC 442</li>
<li>Sumner v UK [2000] SASC 456</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>NB: Cth Parliament has since passed International Criminal Court Act 2002 (Cth) and International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Act 2002 (Cth) that gives effect to Rome Statute obligations and criminalises genocide under Australian law</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Influencing development of the common law
<ul>
<li>Mabo (No 2): ‚ÄòThe common law does not necessarily conform with international law, but international law is a legitimate and important influence on the development of the common law‚Äô (per Brennan J)</li>
<li>Note: ‚Äòcautious approach‚Äô of Mason CJ and Deane J in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh (1995) 183 CLR 272.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Informing Presumptions of Statutory Interpretation
<ul>
<li>i.e. Parliament intends to give effect to Australia‚Äôs obligations under International law (including both treaty &amp; Customary International Law)
<ul>
<li>‚ÄòIf the language of the legislation is susceptible of a construction which is consistent with the terms of the international instrument and the obligations which it imposes on Australia, then that construction will prevail‚Äô (Teoh, per Mason CJ and Deane J)</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>the majority judgments of Mason, Murphy, Brennan and Deane JJ accepted that any inter-national obligation imposed upon Australia by a bona fide international treaty could form the basis for legislation enacted in reliance on s 51(xxix)</li>
<li>the Commonwealth Parliament, and more particularly the government of the day, would not be allowed to rely upon a treaty negotiated with the sole purpose of conferring power under s 51(xxix).</li>

<li>Legislation approving treaties</li>
<li>Use of the language of domestic law

</ul>
</li>
<li>A new statutory regime
<ul>
<li>A completely new statutory regime will normally be created where the subject area covered by the treaty has not previously been the subject of Commonwealth legislation or where there is a desire to emphasise the importance of a treaty and Australia‚Äôs commitment to it ‚Ä¶</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No reference to a treaty
<ul>
<li>This might occur where being a party to the treaty is not necessary to support the constitutional validity of the relevant legislation giving effect to the treat</li>

<li>For example, Alien Tort Claims Act (28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1350) vests original jurisdiction in US Federal District Courts in ‚Äúall causes where an alien sues for a tort only in violation of the law of nations or of a treaty of the United States.‚Äù
<ul>
<li>Effectively provides for an action in tort arising from a violation of international law, (eg human rights, environmental law) no matter where the harm occurred, or who inflicted the harm, as long as the plaintiff serves the summons/statement of claim in U.S. territory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Arguably these matters best left to Private International Law to resolve.
<ul>
<li>‚ÄúPrivate international law is the body of principles, rules, and at time, policies and approaches that indicate how a foreign element in a legal problem or dispute should be dealt with‚Äù</li>

<li>Criminal jurisdiction
<ul>
<li>A state can exercise jurisdiction on the basis of 5 possible principles:
<ul>
<li>Territorial Principle</li>
<li>Nationality Principle</li>
<li>Passive Personality Principle</li>
<li>Protective Principle</li>
<li>Universality Principle</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Territorial Principle
<ul>
<li>Island of Palmas Case (Netherlands v US) (1928) 2 R.I.A.A. 829
<ul>
<li>‚ÄúSovereignty in the relations between States signifies independence. Independence in regard to a portion of the globe is the right to exercise therein, to the exclusion of any other State, the functions of a State.‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Based on notion of undoubted right of a State to legislate with regard to its territory or matter within its territory.</li>
<li>Right is absolute ‚Äì a reflection of sovereignty</li>
<li>Territory not only includes land mass, seas and airspace, but also shipping and aircraft registered in that State.</li>
<li>Simple issue when action takes place completely within the State‚Äôs territory.</li>
<li>The Lotus case (France v Turkey) (1927) P.C.I.J. Reports, Series A. No.10
<ul>
<li>‚ÄúThe first and foremost restriction imposed by international law upon a state is that-failing the exercise of a permissive rule to the contrary-it may not exercise its power in any form in the territory of another State. In this sense jurisdiction is certainly territorial; it cannot be exercised by a State outside its territory except by virtue of a permissive rule derived from international custom or a convention‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nationality Principle
<ul>
<li>‚ÄúNo one disputes the right of a State to subject its citizens abroad to the operations of its own penal laws, if it sees fit to do so‚Äù per  Judge Moore</li>
<li>The Lotus case (France v Turkey) (1927) P.C.I.J. Reports, Series A. No.10
<ul>
<li>Based on State‚Äôs right to make and enforce laws with respect to conduct by, or affecting, its nationals.</li>
<li>Concept adopted by many States is that if you enjoy the advantage and protection of citizenship, you should also be bound by that State‚Äôs laws.</li>
<li>For example Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth), Schedule-Division 119 Foreign Incursions and Recruitment-s 119.1 Incursions into foreign countries with the intention of engaging in hostile activities</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nottebohm Case (Liechtenstein v Guatemala) ICJ Reports 1955, p4.
<ul>
<li>How do we determine nationality in international law?
<ul>
<li>‚Äúreal and effective nationality‚Äù</li>
<li>‚Äúnationality is a legal bond having as its basis a social fact of attachment, a genuine connection of existence, interests and sentiments, together with the existence of reciprocal rights and duties. It may be said to constitute the juridical expression of the fact that the individual upon whom it is conferred, either directly by the law of as the result of an act of authorities, is in fact more closely connected with the population of the State conferring nationality than with that of any other State.‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nationality Principle
<ul>
<li>We do not apply the Nottebohm case test of ‚Äúreal and effective nationality‚Äù for corporate entities.
<ul>
<li>The test for corporate entities is different.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>‚ÄúThe traditional rule attributes the right of diplomatic protection of a corporate entity to the State under the laws of which it is incorporated and in whose territory it has its registered office.‚Äù</li>
<li>Barcelona Traction, Light and Power case (Belgium v Spain) ICJ Reports 1970 p 3</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Passive Personality Principle
<ul>
<li>US v Yunis (No 2) (1988) 82 I.L.R. 344
<ul>
<li>Allows for a State to prosecute a foreign national if his/her actions abroad affect a national of the prosecuting States.</li>
<li>Sometimes seen as an extension to the concepts that underpin the Nationality Principle
<ul>
<li>Nationality Principle= National has committed the harm/crime</li>
<li>Passive Personality Principles=National has suffered the harm</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But different because the Passive Personality Principle only needs a National of the State claiming jurisdiction to be harmed-not the State itself</li>
<li>Controversial-but accepted by some states such as the USA</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Protective Principle
<ul>
<li>The ‚Äòprotection‚Äô of ‚Äòvital‚Äô national interests which may have been injured by the action ‚Äì security, national integrity and political independence.</li>
<li>Looks at State‚Äôs exercise of its jurisdiction to ‚Äòpunish‚Äô actions committed overseas which constitute a threat to the interests of that State.</li>
<li>Used to justify prosecution of terrorists and those who plan / train terrorism / terrorists abroad.</li>
<li>Widely used in espionage /spying type cases ‚Äì popularity of approach increases after the 1960‚Äôs.</li>
<li>Joyce v DPP [1946] AC 347
<ul>
<li>Joyce (aka Lord Haw Haw) was an American national who helped broadcast German propaganda into Britain, during WWII.</li>
<li>Joyce fraudulently obtained a British passport some years earlier.</li>
<li>Charged with 3 counts of High Treason before U.K Courts</li>
<li>American nationality complicated prosecution-Joyce argued lack of jurisdiction ‚Äì cannot betray a country you do not a national of.</li>
<li>Countered by the Crown who argued that as a holder of a British passport (even though fraudulently obtained) Joyce enjoyed the protections that it offered and should be subject to the laws of the U.K.</li>
<li>Held that because he held a British passport he owed an allegiance to the Crown and that his actions where against the interests of Britain (applying the  Protective Principle).</li>
<li>Hanged 3 January 1946.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Universality Principle
<ul>
<li>Accepts that there are certain actions that ‚Äòtranscend‚Äô the jurisdiction of any single State.</li>
<li>Looks at ‚Äòinternational crimes‚Äô that are recognised as affecting the entire world order.</li>
<li>There is no nexus between the State exercising jurisdiction and the action itself i.e.
<ul>
<li>Not committed in territory</li>
<li>Not committed against State</li>
<li>Not committed by, or against, State nationals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nature of the action / crime is the important factor which triggers the jurisdiction.</li>
<li>Aimed at jus cogens type offences such as piracy, slavery, genocide, torture, war crimes and crimes against humanity</li>
<li>Attorney-General of the Government of Israel v Adolf Eichmann  (1961) 36 I.L.R.5. District Court of Jerusalem
<ul>
<li>Nazi Officer responsible for Germany‚Äôs ‚ÄòFinal Solution‚Äô- programme of Genocide.</li>
<li>Escaped to Argentina after WWII.</li>
<li>In 1960 was discovered and kidnapped by Mossad and taken to Israel where he was placed on trial.</li>
<li>Hanged in May 1962.</li>
<li>At Trial and on Appeal, Eichmann raised several defences including:
<ul>
<li>Israel did not exist at the time of the alleged offences.</li>
<li>Actions not taken against Israeli nationals.</li>
<li>Actions did not take place in Israeli territory.</li>
<li>Legal basis for prosecution was retroactive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Main Israeli argument was that crimes fell within Universal Jurisdiction but court also accepted the protective principle founded jurisdiction on the basis of the ‚Äúlinking point doctrine‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>R v Bow Street Metropolitan Magistrate Ex P Pincohet [2000] 1 A.C. 147
<ul>
<li>Spain demanded that former President of Chile (General Pinochet) be extradited for the torture of Spanish citizens in Chile.  Pinochet was in Britain at the time for medical treatment.</li>
<li>Spain argued, inter alia, that under the Universality Principle they had jurisdiction to try Pinochet.</li>
<li>House of Lords held that the international arrest warrant issued by Spain was valid</li>
<li>But only in relation to offences that occurred after U.K. had enacted s134 Criminal Justice Act 1988 - creating an offence of torture  ‚Äúwherever committed worldwide‚Äù under U.K. law).</li>
<li>This was because of requirements of double criminality for extradition</li>
<li>House of Lords also ruled that Pinochet had no right to immunity from prosecution as a former Head of State, and could be put on trial (we will look at this aspect in more detail next week).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>R v Bow Magistrates Ex P Pinochet [2000] 1 A.C. 147 per Lord Browne-Wilkinson
<ul>
<li>‚ÄúThe jus cogens nature of the international crime of torture justifies States in taking universal jurisdiction over torture wherever committed. International law provides that offences of jus cogens may be punished by any state because the offenders are ‚Äúcommon enemies of all mankind and all nations have an equal interest in their apprehension and prosecution‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Democratic Republic of the Congo v Belgium (‚ÄòThe Arrest Warrant Case‚Äô) ICJ Rep 2002, p3
<ul>
<li>Belgium issued an international arrest warrant against Congo‚Äôs Foreign Minister Ndombasi for crimes considered to be grave breaches of International Humanitarian Law (Geneva Conventions &amp; Protocols)</li>
<li>Belgium claimed that it could exercise Universal Jurisdiction.</li>
<li>Congo argued that it was a violation of the principle that a State cannot exercise authority on the territory of another State and that it was also a violation of the principle of sovereign equality between States.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Per Joint separate opinion of Judges Higgins, Hooijmans and Buergenthal
<ul>
<li>Court upheld immunity from jurisdiction and we will look at that aspect of the case next week</li>
<li>But in the course of the judgments comments were made by judges on the issue of Universal Jurisdiction</li>
<li>‚ÄúThat there is no established practice in which States exercise universal jurisdiction, properly so called, is undeniable.</li>
<li>As we have seen, virtually all national legislation envisages links of some sort to the forum State; and no case law exists in which pure universal jurisdiction has formed the basis of jurisdiction.</li>
<li>This does not necessarily indicate, however, that such an exercise would be unlawful‚Ä¶. State practice is neutral as to the exercise of universal jurisdiction‚Äù.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Associated Concepts
<ul>
<li>Multiple Sources ‚Äì a State may have several grounds to support a claim for jurisdiction.</li>
<li>Concurrent Jurisdiction ‚Äì also possible to have a number of States with competing claims all wishing to exercise jurisdiction.</li>

<li>State Jurisdiction
<ul>
<li>Harvard Research in International Law (1935)
<ul>
<li>Objective Territorial Principle
<ul>
<li>asserts that a state has the jurisdiction to prosecute crimes that are initiated outside its territory but have significant effects or consequences within its territory.</li>
<li>AKA Territorial Principle: States have jurisdiction over acts committed within their territory.</li>
<li>D.P.P. v Doot,</li>
<li>R. v Bates,</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Principle of Universality:
<ul>
<li>asserts that a state has jurisdiction to prosecute certain offenses, regardless of where they were committed, and regardless of the nationality of the perpetrator or the victim, because the crimes are so serious that they affect the international community as a whole.</li>
<li>Jus cogens</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nationality Principle:
<ul>
<li>States have jurisdiction over their nationals, even when those nationals are abroad.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Protective Principle:
<ul>
<li>States have jurisdiction over acts outside their territory that threaten the state‚Äôs security, such as espionage or counterfeiting currency.</li>
<li>doctrine  of the contiguous  zone
<ul>
<li>Would  the  principle  allow  State  A to exercise  criminal  jurisdiction  over  the officials  of State  B in respect  of their actions  in the execution  of an  unfriendly  policy (e.g. a trade embargo)  of State  B towards  State  A?</li>
<li>The doctrine provides coastal states with limited enforcement powers beyond their territorial sea, specifically related to customs, immigration, fiscal, and sanitary matters. While it does not confer full sovereignty, it allows states to protect their interests just beyond their territorial boundaries, balancing their rights with the freedoms of other states on the high seas.</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Passive Personality Principle:

<li>Passive Personality Jurisdiction: Authority over acts committed abroad that harm the state‚Äôs nationals.</li>
<li>Protective Jurisdiction: Authority over acts outside a state‚Äôs territory that threaten its security or governmental functions.</li>

<ul>
<li>Immunity from Jurisdiction
<ul>
<li>State Immunity
<ul>
<li>Concept of Immunity is underpinned by the principles of State Sovereignty, reciprocity and State equality (par in parem non habet imperium ‚Äì an equal does not have power over an equal).</li>
<li>Concept of Immunity has developed with time and there has been a move from the traditional Absolute Immunity approach (where the State enjoyed complete immunity from domestic legal action) to a so called Restrictive Immunity approach (where the State only enjoys immunity under certain circumstances).</li>
<li>Two key cases are important to understanding the difference
<ul>
<li>The Schooner Exchange v McFaddon- (US Supreme Court) 1812 11 US 116 (7Cranch)-Absolute Immunity</li>
<li>I Congreso Del Partido [1983] 1 A.C. 244- Restrictive Immunity</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>State Immunity-Absolute Immunity
<ul>
<li>The Schooner Exchange v McFaddon (US Supreme Court) 1812 11 US 116 (7Cranch)</li>
<li>French navy vessel docked in Philadelphia</li>
<li>Claimed it was in fact an American schooner called The Exchange.</li>
<li>Issue: Did the court have jurisdiction to consider whether the vessel should be seized and returned to party who claimed they were rightful owner?
<ul>
<li>Court held lacked jurisdiction because French navy vessel enjoyed immunity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>‚Äú.. Perfect equality and absolute independence of sovereigns‚Ä¶ have given rise to a class of cases in which every sovereign is understood to waive the exercise of a part of that complete exclusive territorial jurisdiction which has been stated to be the attribute of every nation‚Ä¶a public armed ship‚Ä¶constitutes a part of the military force of her nation; acts under the immediate and direct command of the sovereign; is employed by him [sic] in national objects‚Ä¶interference cannot take place without affecting his power and his dignity. The implied licence, therefore, under which such vessel enters the friendly port, may reasonably be construed‚Ä¶.as containing an exemption from the jurisdiction of the sovereign within whose territory she claims the right of hospitality..‚Äù Per Marshall CJ</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>State Immunity- Restrictive immunity
<ul>
<li>I Congreso Del Partido [1983] 1 A.C. 244
<ul>
<li>Cubazucar (a cuban state owned enterprise) contracted to sell two ship loads of sugar to a Chilean company shipped on two vessels (Playa Larga and the Marble Islands) owned by another Cuban state enterprise Mambisa.</li>
<li>Following the military coup by General Pinochet in Chile the Playa Larga only unloaded part of the sugar cargo in Chile and left port.</li>
<li>The Marble Islands was diverted to North Vietnam</li>
<li>Chilean purchasers of the cuban sugar then had a third Cuban vessel the I Congresso arrested in the UK claiming damages for breach of contract and in Tort</li>
<li>The Cuban government entered a defence of state immunity and argued that the I Congresso could not be seized.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>‚Äú‚Ä¶ I have no doubt that the ‚Äúrestrictive‚Äù doctrine should be applied to the present case‚Ä¶[T]he limitation‚Ä¶ under the so called ‚Äúrestrictive theory‚Äù, arises from the willingness of states to enter into commercial, or other private law, transaction with individuals. It appears to have two main foundations:
<ul>
<li>(a) It is necessary in the interest of justice to individuals having such transaction with states to allow them to bring such transactions before the courts.</li>
<li>(b) To require a state to answer a claim based upon such transactions does not involve a challenge to or inquiry into any of sovereignty or government act of that state‚Ä¶.neither a threat to the dignity of the state, nor any interference with its sovereign functions‚Ä¶‚Ä¶commercial transaction‚Ä¶a commercial or private law, character‚Ä¶‚Äù</li>
<li>Per Lord Wilberforce</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>‚Äú‚Ä¶ Clearly a breach of a contract of that character was within the area of private law‚Ä¶simply (i) whether it could be said that the relevant contract was concluded for governmental purposes, and (ii) whether it was relevant that governmental motives were advanced for breaching the contract‚Ä¶
<ul>
<li>Under the ‚Äúrestrictive‚Äù theory the court has first to characterise the activity into which the defendant state has entered.</li>
<li>Having done this, and (assumedly) found it to be of a commercial or private law, character, it may take the view that contractual breaches, or torts, prima facie fall within the same sphere of activity.</li>
<li>It should then be for the defendant state to make a case‚Ä¶that the act complained of is outside that sphere, and within that of sovereign action‚Äù Per Lord Wilberforce</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trendex Trading Corp v Central Bank of Nigeria [1977] Q.B. 529
<ul>
<li>‚Äú‚Ä¶The doctrine grants immunity to a foreign government or its department of state or any body which can be regarded as an ‚Äúalter ego or organ‚Äù of the government‚Ä¶. I confess that I can think of no satisfactory test except that of looking to the functions and control of the organisation. I do not think that it should depend on the foreign law alone. I would look to all the evidence to see whether the organisation was under government control and exercised governmental functions‚Äù per Denning M.R.</li>

</li>
<li>State Immunity
<ul>
<li>Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (Germany v. Italy, with Greece intervening) ICJ Rep 2012, p.99
<ul>
<li>‚Äúunder customary international law as it presently stands, a State is not deprived of immunity by reason of the fact that it is accused of serious violations of international human rights law or the international law of armed conflict‚Ä¶</li>
<li>The rules of State immunity are procedural in character and are confined to determining whether or not the courts of one State may exercise jurisdiction in respect of another State.
<ul>
<li>They do not bear upon the question whether or not the conduct in respect of which the proceedings are brought was lawful or unlawful.‚Äù [at para 91 &amp; 94].</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>State Immunity- Foreign State Immunities Act 1985 (Cth)
<ul>
<li>The general rule now is that activities must fall within the doctrine of governmental action (acta jure imperii def) and not be of a commercial nature (acta jure gestionis def) to attract immunity</li>
<li>This approach to State Immunity is reflected in Australian Domestic Law by the Foreign State Immunities Act 1985 (Cth)
<ul>
<li>s 9 General immunity from jurisdiction
<ul>
<li>Except as provided by or under this Act, a foreign State is immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of Australia in a proceeding.</li>

<li>Congo argued that it was a violation of principle that a State cannot exercise authority on territory of another State and that it was also a violation of the principle of sovereign equality between States.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>LAST WEEK WE LOOKED AT THIS CASE IN TERMS OF UNIVERSAL JURISDICTION BUT IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT ON QUESTION OF IMMUNITIES</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Diplomatic and consular immunity
<ul>
<li>Diplomats are immune from all administrative, civil, criminal jurisdiction of the receiving State, to which they are accredited.</li>
<li>Generally, a Diplomats family will also enjoy the same immunities (provided they are not a citizen of the host State)</li>
<li>Diplomats are unable to do their jobs/role without fear or favour. Concept is based on so-called ‚Äòfunctional necessity‚Äô theory.</li>
<li>The criteria for diplomatic status are set out in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 1961 (‚ÄòVienna Convention‚Äô).</li>
<li>The Vienna Convention has been made part of Australian domestic law pursuant to the Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities Act 1967 (Cth)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Diplomatic &amp; Consular Immunity
<ul>
<li>‚Äúdiplomatic agent‚Äù (Art 1)</li>
<li>Under the Vienna Convention, diplomats are considered inviolable and not subject to arrest or detention (art 29).</li>
<li>They are absolutely immune from criminal prosecution (art 31) and are immune from civil suite except in relation private activities outside their official functions (art 31).</li>
<li>Important to note that the Immunity belongs to the State not the diplomat ‚Üí immunity can be waved by the sending State</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Diplomatic &amp; Consular Immunity
<ul>
<li>Under the Vienna Convention, the Diplomatic Mission and its premises are considered to inviolable (art 22).</li>
<li>The agents of the receiving State may not enter them, except with the consent of the head of mission.</li>
<li>Mistaken belief is that this inviolability is because Diplomatic Mission premises is considered to be the sovereign territory of that particular State.</li>
<li>Correct interpretation is based on ‚Äòfunctional necessity‚Äô theory = to be able to fulfil its function, a Diplomatic Mission must be free from all interference from other States. Honoured through notions of reciprocity and Sovereign State equality.
<ul>
<li>Under the Vienna Convention art 27, the host State will permit and protect all free communications on behalf of the Mission ‚Äì provided that it is for an official purpose.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Treaties on treaties
<ul>
<li>Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969 (VCLT)
<ul>
<li>VCLT is considered the ‚ÄòTreaty on Treaties‚Äô and as such, provides the principles of law relating to the drafting, application and interpretation of other treaties.</li>
<li>It is largely recognised as the pre-eminent statement on the law of treaties, even by those States who are not parties to the Convention.</li>
<li>Codification of Customary International Law</li>
<li>The VCLT came into force in 1980 and took approx 20 years to draft.</li>
<li>Customary International law governs treaties that fall outside of the VCLT and treaties involving non-state parties to the VCLT (See VCLT Preamble)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Definition of a Treaty
<ul>
<li>What is a treaty?
<ul>
<li>A Treaty is defined as:
<ul>
<li>An international agreement concluded between States in written form and governed by international law, whether embodied in a single instrument or in two or more related instruments and whatever its particular designation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(See Art. 2 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969 ‚Äì VCLT).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>‚ÄòConcluded between states‚Äô
<ul>
<li>Article 3
<ul>
<li>The fact that the present Convention does not apply to international agreements concluded between States and other subjects of international law or between such other subjects of international law ‚Ä¶ shall not affect:
<ul>
<li>(a) the legal force of such agreements;</li>
<li>(b) the application to them of any of the rules set forth in the present Convention to which they would be subject under international law independently of the Convention;</li>
<li>(c) the application of the Convention to the relations of States as between themselves under international agreements to which other subjects of international law are also parties.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>‚Äòin written form‚Äô

<ul>
<li>‚Ä¶[w]here ‚Ä¶ as is generally the case in international law, which places the principal emphasis on the intention of the parties, the law prescribes no particular form, parties are free to choose what they please provided their intention clearly results from it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Article 3 - The fact that the present Convention does not apply to ‚Ä¶ international agreements not in written form, shall not affect‚Ä¶
<ul>
<li>‚Äòtreaty‚Äô, ‚Äòconvention‚Äô and protocol etc</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>‚Äògoverned by international law‚Äô
<ul>
<li>Customary international law ‚Äì intention of parties to create legal relations is essential requirement of valid treaty</li>
<li>VCLT ‚Äì ILC indicated that this is reflected in Article 2(1)(a)</li>
<li>Terms of Art. 2 VCLT make it clear that unilateral statements and agreements intended to be governed under municipal law (e.g. contracts, leases etc) are beyond the scope of the VCLT.</li>
<li>Obligation created should be governed by international law.  cf a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) which does not necessarily contain an intention to create legal obligations under international law.</li>

<ul>
<li>Article 6
<ul>
<li>Every State possesses capacity to conclude treaties.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Who represents the State in negotiations?</li>
<li>Article 7
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>A person is considered as representing a State for the purpose ‚Ä¶for the purpose of expressing the consent of the State to be bound by a treaty if:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>(a) ‚Ä¶produces appropriate full powers; or (b) it appears from the practice of the States concerned ‚Ä¶that their intention ‚Ä¶.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>In virtue of their functions and without having to produce full powers, the following are considered as representing their State:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>(a) Heads of State, Heads of Government and Ministers for Foreign Affairs‚Ä¶;</li>
<li>(b) heads of diplomatic missions‚Ä¶;</li>
<li>(c) representatives accredited by States to an international conference or to an international organization</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adoption of the text
<ul>
<li>Article 9
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The adoption of the text of a treaty takes place by the consent of all the States participating in its drawing up except as provided in paragraph 2.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>The adoption of the text of a treaty at an international conference takes place by the vote of two-thirds of the States present and voting, unless by the same majority they shall decide to apply a different rule.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Authentication of the text
<ul>
<li>Article 10
<ul>
<li>The text of a treaty is established as authentic and definitive:
<ul>
<li>(a) by such procedure as may be provided for in the text or agreed upon by the States participating in its drawing up; or</li>
<li>(b) failing such procedure, by the signature, signature ad referendum or initialling by the representatives of those States of the text of the treaty or of the Final Act of a conference incorporating the text.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consent to be bound
<ul>
<li>A State may become a party to a treaty through more than one path.</li>
<li>For example, they may sign the treaty during the period in which the treaty is open for signature and then ratify the treaty.</li>
<li>Or they may also become a party by acceding to or by accepting the treaty at a later date.</li>
<li>Article 11 - The consent of a State to be bound by a treaty may be expressed by signature, exchange of instruments constituting a treaty, ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, or by any other means if so agreed.</li>
<li>Generally, a treaty will set out how States may express their consent to be bound by the terms of the treaty.  Methods may include:
<ul>
<li>Signature - Art 12 VCLT</li>
<li>Exchange of Instruments - Art 13 VCLT</li>
<li>Ratification, acceptance or approval - Art 14 VCLT</li>
<li>Accession - Art 15</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In Australia (and many other countries) the normal process is to sign the treaty to show the acceptance of text of the treaty. The treaty then needs to come back to government to decide whether to accept or reject the treaty.</li>
<li>If accepted by the government, domestic legislation will be enacted and the treaty will be expressed in municipal law.  This domestic act of ‚Äòratification‚Äô is required before the Australian government will take any binding action.</li>

<li>Intention to create Legal relations.
- When determining the intention of the parties, the l. C.J. applies an objective test.

<li>In contrast,  the  minutes  of an  earlier meeting  of a Tripartite  Committee  established  by the  same  three  states  to  negotiate  the  reference  of the  dispute  to  the Court  were  just ‚Äúdiplomatic  documents  recording  the state  of progress  of the  negotiations‚Äù:

<li>Competence of the General Assembly for the Admission of a State to the United Nations (Advisory Opinion), ICJ Reports 1950, 4
<ul>
<li>‚ÄúIn one of the written statements placed before the Court, an attempt was made to attribute to paragraph 2 of Article 4 a different meaning. The Court considers it necessary to Say that the first duty of a tribunal which is called upon to interpret and apply the provisions of a treaty, is to endeavour to give effect to them in their natural and ordinary meaning in the context in which they occur. If the relevant words in their natural and ordinary meaning make sense in their context, that is an end of the matter. If, on the other hand, the words in their natural and ordinary meaning are ambiguous or lead to an unreasonable result, then, and then only, must the Court, by resort to other methods of interpretation, seek to ascertain what the parties really did mean when they used these words‚Äù.</li>

<li>(a) any agreenuent relating to the treaty which was nuade between all the parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty;</li>
<li>(b) any instrurnent which was inade by one or nxore parties in connection with the conclusion Of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrurnent related to the treaty.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="3">
<li>There shall be taken into account, together with the context:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;</li>
<li>(b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Supplementary means of interpretation
<ul>
<li>Article 32
<ul>
<li>Supplementary‚Äô means of interpretation
<ul>
<li>Recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31 :</li>
<li>(a) leaves the meanmg ambiguous or obscure; or</li>
<li>(b) leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.</li>

<ul>
<li>The principle of interpretation expressed in the maxim : Ut res magis valeat quam pereat, often referred to as the rule of effectiveness, cannot justify the Court in attributing to the provisions for the settlement of disputes in the Peace Treaties a meaning which, as stated above, would be contrary to their letter and spirit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Multiple languages
<ul>
<li>Article 33
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>When a treaty has been authenticated in two or more languages, the text is equally authoritative in each language, unless the treaty provides or the parties agree that, in case of divergence, a particular text shall prevail.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>A version of the treaty in a language other than one of those in which the text was authenticated shall be considered an authentic text only if the treaty so provides or the parties so agree.</li>

<li>Except where a particular text prevails in accordance with paragraph 1, when a comparison of the authentic texts discloses a difference of meaning which the application of articles 31 and 32 does not remove, the meaning which best reconciles the texts, having regard to the object and purpose of the treaty, shall be adopted.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Article 35-Treaties providing for obligations for third States
<ul>
<li>An obligation arises for a third State from a provision of a treaty if the parties to the treaty intend the provision to be the means of establishing the obligation and the third State expressly accepts that obligation in writing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Article 36-Treaties providing for rights for third States
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>A right arises for a third State from a provision of a treaty if the parties to the treaty intend the provision to accord that right either to the third State, or to a group of States to which it belongs, or to all States, and the third State assents thereto. Its assent shall be presumed so long as the contrary is not indicated, unless the treaty otherwise provides.</li>

<ul>
<li>It cannot be lightly presumed that stipulations favourable to a third State have been adopted with the object of creating an actual right in its favour.</li>
<li>There is however nothing to prevent the will of sovereign States from having this object and this effect.</li>
<li>The question of the existence of a right acquired under an instrument drawn between other States is therefore one to be decided in each particular case:
<ul>
<li>it must be ascertained whether the States which have stipulated in favour of a third State meant to create for that State an actual right which the latter has accepted as such.</li>

<li>Intro
<ul>
<li>-It is a well recognised principle of International Law that States are responsible for internationally wrongful acts that can be attributed to them and that as a result, they are obliged to make reparation in one form or another.</li>
<li>-In the Chorzow Factory Case (1928) P.C.IJ. Series A No 17, the PCIJ held:
<ul>
<li>‚Äúit is a principle of international law, and even a greater conception of law, that any breach of an engagement involves an obligation to make reparation.‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>-Likewise the ILC‚Äôs Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States provides:
<ul>
<li>‚ÄúEvery internationally wrongful act of a State entails the international responsibility of that State‚Äù (art 1)</li>
<li>Customary International Law Authority</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Elements of State Responsibility
<ul>
<li>State Responsibility arises in the following circumstances:
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Existence of an international legal obligation in force between two or more states, or a legal obligation to the ‚Äòinternational community‚Äô (obligations erga omnes)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>Occurrence of an act or omission that:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>I. is attributed to that state</li>
<li>Ii. breaches that obligation (‚Äòinternationally  wrongful act‚Äô)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="3">
<li>The state cannot raise any circumstances or justifications for the internationally wrongful act that would preclude wrongfulness</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="4">
<li>Another state (the ‚Äòinvoking‚Äô state) is entitled to make a claim (ie question of admissibility)</li>

<li>Corfu Channel Case (UK v Albania) (Merits) [1949] ICJ Rep 4
<ul>
<li>Question: Could Albania be held responsible for injury to British warships due to mines in Albanian territorial waters?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Attribution to the State
<ul>
<li>ICJ held:
<ul>
<li>‚Äúknowledge of the mine laying could not be imputed to the Albanian government by reason merely of the fact that the minefield discovered in Albanian territorial waters caused the explosions of which the British warships were the victims‚Äô.</li>
<li>‚ÄòThe fact that this exclusive territorial control exercised by a state within its frontiers has a bearing on the method of proof available to establish the knowledge of that state as to such events ‚Ä¶ [In such circumstance, the invoking state] should be allowed a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence‚Äô.</li>
<li>Albania could be liable for failing to notify of presence of minefield because ‚Äòthe laying of the minefield ‚Ä¶ could not have been accomplished without the knowledge of the Albanian government.‚Äù</li>

<li>Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of Congo v Uganda) I.C.J. Reports 2005, p. 168
<ul>
<li>‚ÄúThe Court turns now to the question as to whether acts and omissions of the UPDF and its officers and soldiers are attributable to Uganda.</li>
<li>The conduct of the UPDF as a whole is clearly attributable to Uganda, being the conduct of a State organ.</li>
<li>According to a well-established rule of international law, which is of customary character, ‚Äúthe conduct of any organ of a State must be regarded as an act of that State‚Ä¶The conduct of individual soldiers and officers of the UPDF is to be considered as the conduct of a State organ.</li>
<li>In the Court‚Äôs view, by virtue of the military status and function of Ugandan soldiers in the DRC, their conduct is attributable to Uganda. The contention that the persons concerned did not act in the capacity of persons exercising governmental authority in the particular circumstances, is therefore without merit.‚Äù para 213</li>

<li>ILC Draft Article 5
<ul>
<li>Conduct of persons or entities exercising elements of governmental authority</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>‚ÄúThe conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State under article 4 but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of the governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under international law, provided the person or entity is acting in that capacity in the particular instance.‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro) ICJ Reports 2007, p 43
<ul>
<li>‚ÄúThis question has in fact two aspects, which the Court must consider separately. First, it should be ascertained whether the acts committed at Srebrenica were perpetrated by organs of the Respondent, i.e., by persons or entities whose conduct is necessarily attributable to it, because they are in fact the instruments of its action. Next, if the preceding question is answered in the negative, it should be ascertained whether the acts in question were committed by persons who, while not organs of the Respondent, did nevertheless act on the instruments of, or under the direction or control of, the Respondent‚Äù.</li>
<li>Court concluded Bosnian Serb Militia not organs of the state and insufficient evidence to show acted under Serbian direction or control.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Caire Claim (France v Mexico) (1929) 5 RIAA 516-‚ÄùThe State also bears international responsibility for all acts committed by its official or its organs which are delictual according to international law, regardless of whether the official or organ has acted within the limits of his competency or has exceeded those limits‚Ä¶However, in order to justify the admission of this objective responsibility of the State for acts committed by its officials or organs outside their competence, it is necessary that they should have acted, at least apparently, as authorised officials or organs, or that, in acting they should have used powers or measures appropriate to their official character‚Äù at p 147-148.</li>

<li>Youmans v United Mexican States (1926) 4 RIAA 110
<ul>
<li>Question: Was Mexico liable for murder of USA national who were killed during rioting?
<ul>
<li>NB riots included participation of soldiers who acted contrary to higher orders.</li>
<li>‚ÄòWe do not consider that the participation of the soldiers in the murder ‚Ä¶ can be regarded as acts of soldiers committed in their private capacity when it is clear that at the time of the commission of these acts the men were on duty and under the immediate supervision and in the presence of a commanding officer.  Soldiers inflicting personal injuries or committing wanton destruction or looting always act in disobedience of some rules laid down by superior authority.  There could be no liability whatever for such misdeeds if the view were taken that any acts committed by soldiers in contravention of instructions must always be considered as personal acts.‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Generally, the acts of private individuals are not attributable to the State.
<ul>
<li>Two exceptions to this rule are:
<ul>
<li>-Acts of ‚Äòinstructed persons‚Äô ‚Äì eg where an individual is ‚Äòrecruited‚Äô by a government agency to act in a private capacity (volunteer) to make sure that the act is conducted outside the official structure.</li>
<li>-Acts of a person ‚Äòdirected or controlled‚Äô by the State ‚Äì eg where third parties (usually a rebel group) act under the direction of another State</li>

<li>United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Iran (US v Iran) (‚ÄòTehran Hostages Case‚Äô) ICJ Rep 1980
<ul>
<li>Question: Could Iran be held liable for acts of militants, who seized US embassy compound and took personnel hostage for over a year?</li>
<li>US argued breach of Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations as:
<ul>
<li>-Iranian diplomatic police had disappeared from scene</li>
<li>-No subsequent attempt made by Iranian government to rescue the hostages</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Court held:
<ul>
<li>Not acts of state at the time of the storming of the embassy. Yet Ayatollah Khomeini‚Äôs policy of maintaining the embassy occupation for the purpose of exerting pressure on US ‚Äúfundamentally transformed the legal nature of the situation‚Äù</li>
<li>‚ÄúThe approval given to these facts by the Ayatollah ‚Ä¶ and the decision to perpetuate them, translated continuting occupation of the embassy and detention of the hostages into acts of the State.  The militants, authors and jailers of the hostages, had now become agents of the Iranian State for whose acts the State itself was internationally responsible‚Ä¶‚Äù at para 74.‚Äô</li>

<ul>
<li>Court:
<ul>
<li>International Court of Justice (ICJ)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Parties:
<ul>
<li>Republic of The Gambia (Applicant) v. Republic of the Union of Myanmar (Respondent)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Procedural History:
<ul>
<li>The Gambia filed an application on 11 November 2019, alleging Myanmar violated the Genocide Convention.</li>
<li>The case included a request for provisional measures, granted in January 2020.</li>
<li>Myanmar raised objections to the jurisdiction and admissibility, which were dismissed in a judgment on 22 July 2022.</li>
<li>In 2023, the Maldives and several other states filed declarations of intervention.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Facts:
<ul>
<li>The Gambia accused Myanmar of committing genocide against the Rohingya, violating the 1948 Genocide Convention.</li>
<li>Various states sought to intervene under Article 63 of the ICJ Statute, seeking to influence the interpretation of the Convention.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Legal Issue:
<ul>
<li>Whether the intervention declarations filed by the Maldives and a group of other states met the requirements under Article 63 and whether their scope adhered to the limits of convention interpretation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Decision:
<ul>
<li>The Court admitted the interventions by the Maldives and the joint group of states, but only in relation to the interpretation of the Genocide Convention.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ratio Decidendi:
<ul>
<li>Article 63 grants states the right to intervene in cases involving the construction of a convention to which they are parties, without needing to show a specific legal interest beyond their membership.</li>
<li>The ICJ determined that the declarations conformed to this, focusing on the interpretation of the convention‚Äôs relevant articles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Significance:
<ul>
<li>This case highlights the procedural role of third-party interventions under the ICJ Statute and reinforces the interpretation of states‚Äô rights under international conventions, especially concerning genocidal acts.</li>

<li>Part IX: The Law of Responsibility - Consequences of an Internationally Wrongful Act from James Crawford‚Äôs Commentary in Brownlie‚Äôs Principles of Public International Law
<ul>
<li>Case Name:
<ul>
<li>The Law of Responsibility: Consequences of an Internationally Wrongful Act</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Procedural History:
<ul>
<li>This part of the commentary deals with the legal consequences and obligations that arise from internationally wrongful acts committed by states, as structured under the International Law Commission‚Äôs (ILC) Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Original Dispute:
<ul>
<li>The core issue here is how states are held accountable for breaches of international obligations and the types of reparations they are required to offer in response.</li>
<li>The analysis also includes the role of countermeasures in enforcing compliance with international law when cessation or reparation is not forthcoming.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reason for Trial:
<ul>
<li>The purpose of the trial, or in this context the legal commentary, is to assess the types of legal consequences states face after committing wrongful acts. This includes the processes by which cessation, restitution, compensation, and satisfaction are invoked, as well as the rules for taking countermeasures against a state that refuses to rectify its wrongful actions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Material Facts:</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cessation def is an obligation that exists after a wrongful act to stop the breach and comply with international obligations moving forward.</li>
<li>Reparation is the broader obligation to repair the harm caused by the wrongful act, and it may take the form of:
<ul>
<li>Restitution: restoring the situation to what it was before the wrongful act.</li>
<li>Compensation: financial payment when restitution is not feasible.</li>
<li>Satisfaction: addressing non-material damage, such as through apologies or trials.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Countermeasures are defined as acts taken by an injured state when the responsible state fails to meet its obligations to cease or make reparations for the wrongful act.
<ul>
<li>Issue Raised:
<ul>
<li>The main legal question is how state responsibility is invoked and enforced under international law, and how the various forms of reparation and countermeasures are properly implemented in practice.</li>
<li>Additionally, the commentary addresses the conditions for taking countermeasures, such as proportionality and legal limits, especially regarding serious breaches of peremptory norms (jus cogens).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Law(s)/Statute(s) in Contention:
<ul>
<li>ARSIWA (Articles on State Responsibility), focusing on:
<ul>
<li>Article 30 (Obligations of cessation).</li>
<li>Article 31 (Reparation in full for injuries caused by a wrongful act).</li>
<li>Article 35 (Restitution).</li>
<li>Article 36 (Compensation).</li>
<li>Article 37 (Satisfaction).</li>
<li>Article 22 and 49-54 (Countermeasures).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Precedents:
<ul>
<li>Factory at Chorz√≥w (Germany v. Poland):
<ul>
<li>Established the principle of reparation, which requires a wrongful act to be fully remedied to restore the status quo ante.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>M/V Saiga (No 2):
<ul>
<li>Reaffirmed the principle that reparation must restore the injured state or party to the position it would have held had the breach not occurred.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gabƒç√≠kovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary/Slovakia):
<ul>
<li>Discussed the proportionality of countermeasures and state responsibility for breach of international obligations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tests:
<ul>
<li>The proportionality test for countermeasures, ensuring that responses by injured states are proportional to the wrongful act.</li>
<li>The causation test for compensation, requiring that damages claimed must be directly linked to the wrongful act.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Words and Phrases Considered:
<ul>
<li>Restitution: Return to the pre-breach state, where possible.</li>
<li>Satisfaction: Non-material remedies such as apologies or other symbolic actions.</li>
<li>Countermeasures: Unlawful actions taken in response to an unlawful act, justified as a way to induce compliance with international obligations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Arguments by Party:
<ul>
<li>The responsible state must first be called upon to cease the wrongful conduct and make reparations before countermeasures can be taken.</li>
<li>The injured state may invoke countermeasures only after these remedies have been sought and refused, and the measures must be proportionate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Judicial Opinions:
<ul>
<li>The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has consistently upheld that reparation should aim to fully restore the injured party to the position it would have occupied if the wrongful act had not occurred (Factory at Chorz√≥w).</li>
<li>Restitution remains the preferred form of reparation, though it may not always be possible or proportionate, leading to compensation as the next best option.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Legal Reasoning:
<ul>
<li>Crawford‚Äôs analysis emphasizes that cessation and reparation arise automatically upon the occurrence of a wrongful act, while countermeasures are a last resort, taken only after the responsible state fails to meet its secondary obligations. These principles reflect a balance between maintaining international peace and upholding legal order through the enforcement of responsibilities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ratio Decidendi:
<ul>
<li>The legal obligation to repair is essential in international law, aiming to restore the injured state to its prior status through cessation, restitution, or compensation. Countermeasures are allowed but heavily regulated to ensure that they do not exceed the harm caused or violate other peremptory norms of international law.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Result:
<ul>
<li>The state found responsible for a wrongful act must immediately cease the violation and take steps to make full reparation, either through restitution, compensation, or satisfaction. In cases of severe breaches, such as violations of erga omnes norms, all states may have an interest in ensuring that the wrongful act is remedied.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Relevance to Modern Law:
<ul>
<li>Crawford‚Äôs commentary highlights the increasing importance of erga omnes obligations and jus cogens norms in the modern international legal system, stressing that states have an interest in upholding certain fundamental rights and obligations even when they are not directly injured. This has implications for global enforcement of human rights and state accountability for breaches of international law.</li>
<li>This detailed analysis provides insight into the functioning of state responsibility and the enforcement mechanisms available under international law, making it a foundational element for understanding modern international legal practice.</li>

<ul>
<li>Court:
<ul>
<li>International Court of Justice (ICJ)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Parties:
<ul>
<li>United Kingdom v Albania</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Procedural History:
<ul>
<li>The case was brought before the ICJ after a series of incidents in the Corfu Channel, where British warships were damaged by mines.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Facts:
<ul>
<li>In 1946, British naval ships suffered damage while passing through the Corfu Channel, located between Greece and Albania.</li>
<li>The United Kingdom accused Albania of laying mines in the channel without warning, thus causing damage to their ships.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Legal Issue:
<ul>
<li>Whether Albania was responsible for the explosion of the mines and if it had violated international law by not informing other states about the mines‚Äô existence in its territorial waters.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Decision:
<ul>
<li>The ICJ held that Albania was responsible for the damage to the British ships.</li>
<li>It found that Albania had knowledge of the minefield and failed to notify other states, constituting a breach of its international obligations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ratio Decidendi:
<ul>
<li>The court established that states have a duty to notify others about known dangers in their waters, and failing to do so may constitute an internationally wrongful act.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Significance:
<ul>
<li>This case reinforced the principles of state responsibility and the duty to notify other states of hazards in international navigation channels, laying groundwork for later international law developments on state responsibility.</li>

<li>Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons (Advisory Opinion) [1996] ICJ Reports 226
<ul>
<li>Procedural History:
<ul>
<li>The United Nations General Assembly requested the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to issue an advisory opinion on whether the threat or use of nuclear weapons is permitted under international law, pursuant to Resolution 49/75 K.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Original Dispute:
<ul>
<li>The question was whether the threat or use of nuclear weapons under any circumstances is lawful under international law.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Issue Raised:
<ul>
<li>Is the threat or use of nuclear weapons lawful under international law?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Law(s)/Statute(s) in Contention:
<ul>
<li>UN Charter, Article 2(4) and Article 51</li>
<li>Customary international law and the principles of international humanitarian law</li>
<li>The Martens Clause and various treaties related to nuclear disarmament and weapons of mass destruction</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Precedents:
<ul>
<li>The Court referenced the principles of self-defense under the UN Charter and humanitarian law, particularly regarding the protection of civilians and the proportionality of force.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tests:
<ul>
<li>The Court applied tests of necessity and proportionality under Article 51 of the UN Charter and the rules of international humanitarian law, especially regarding indiscriminate weapons and unnecessary suffering.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Words and Phrases Considered:
<ul>
<li>‚ÄúThreat‚Äù and ‚Äúuse‚Äù of force under the UN Charter</li>
<li>‚ÄúNecessity‚Äù and ‚Äúproportionality‚Äù in self-defense</li>
<li>‚ÄúIndiscriminate weapons‚Äù under international humanitarian law</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Arguments by Party:
<ul>
<li>Some states argued that nuclear deterrence is lawful under self-defense, while others emphasized that the destructive nature of nuclear weapons is incompatible with humanitarian law principles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Judicial Opinions:
<ul>
<li>The Court found no specific authorization for the use of nuclear weapons in international law.</li>
<li>However, it also found no comprehensive and universal prohibition on their use.</li>
<li>The Court was divided (7-7) on whether the use of nuclear weapons in extreme circumstances of self-defense, where the survival of a state is at stake, could be considered lawful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Legal Reasoning:
<ul>
<li>The ICJ reasoned that although international law does not explicitly prohibit the use of nuclear weapons, their use must comply with the rules of armed conflict, particularly the protection of civilians and the prohibition of unnecessary suffering.</li>
<li>In extreme cases of self-defense, the Court could not definitively determine their legality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ratio Decidendi:
<ul>
<li>While the threat or use of nuclear weapons is generally considered contrary to international law, especially humanitarian law, the Court could not conclude whether such use would be lawful in extreme self-defense scenarios.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Result:
<ul>
<li>The Court could not definitively rule on the legality of nuclear weapons in all circumstances but emphasized the obligation to pursue nuclear disarmament in good faith.</li>
<li>It laid emphasis on two cardinal principles :
<ul>
<li>(a) the first being aimed at the distinction between combatants and non-combatants ; States must never make civilians the object of attack and must consequently never use weapons that are incapable of distinguishing between civilian and military targets while</li>
<li>(b) according to the second of those principles, unnecessary suffering should not be caused to combatants.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Relevance to Modern Law:
<ul>
<li>This opinion remains pivotal in international legal discussions on nuclear disarmament, the legality of deterrence strategies, and the application of humanitarian law to weapons of mass destruction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
